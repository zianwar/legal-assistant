It shall be no objection to the validity of the assessment, or the lien thereof:

1. That the contract for the improvement was not awarded in the manner or at the time required by law; or

2. That the assessment was made by an unauthorized officer or person if the assessment roll was confirmed by the city or town authorities; or

3. That the assessment is based upon a front foot basis, or upon a basis of benefits to the property within the improvement district unless it is made to appear that the city or town authorities did not act in good faith and did not attempt to act fairly in regard thereto or unless it is made to appear that the city or town authorities acted fraudulently or oppressively in making the assessment.

All local improvement assessments heretofore or hereafter made by city or town authorities in good faith are valid and in full force and effect.

## 35.50.030 - Authority and conditions precedent to foreclosure.
If on the first day of January in any year, two installments of any local improvement assessment are delinquent, or if the final installment thereof has been delinquent for more than one year, the city or town shall proceed with the foreclosure of the delinquent assessment or delinquent installments thereof by proceedings brought in its own name in the superior court of the county in which the city or town is situate.

The proceedings shall be commenced on or before March 1st of that year or on or before such other date in such year as may be fixed by general ordinance, but not before the city or town treasurer has notified by certified mail the persons whose names appear on the current assessment roll as owners of the property charged with the assessments or installments which are delinquent, at the address last known to the treasurer, a notice thirty days before the commencement of the proceedings. If the person whose name appears on the assessment rolls of the county assessor as owner of the property, or whose name appears on the tax rolls of the county treasurer as taxpayer of the property, or the address shown for the owner, differs from that appearing on the city or town assessment roll, then the treasurer shall also mail a copy of the notice to that person or that address.

The notice shall state the amount due, including foreclosure costs, upon each separate lot, tract, or parcel of land and the date after which the proceedings will be commenced.

## 35.50.040 - Entire assessment, foreclosure of.
When the local improvement assessment is payable in installments, the enforcement of the lien of any installment shall not prevent the enforcement of the lien of any subsequent installment.

A city or town may by general ordinance provide that upon failure to pay any installment due the entire assessment shall become due and payable and the collection thereof enforced by foreclosure: PROVIDED, That the payment of all delinquent installments together with interest, penalty, and administrative costs at any time before entry of judgment in foreclosure shall extend the time of payment on the remainder of the assessments as if there had been no delinquency or foreclosure. Where foreclosure of two installments of the same assessment on any lot, tract, or parcel is sought, the city or town treasurer shall cause such lot, tract, or parcel to be dismissed from the action, if the installment first delinquent together with interest, penalty, administrative costs, and charges is paid at any time before sale.

For all lots, tracts, or parcels which contain a residential structure with an assessed value of at least two thousand dollars, all persons owning or claiming to own the property shall be made defendants thereto. For all other lots, tracts, or parcels, the persons whose names appear on the assessment roll and property tax rolls as owners of the property charged with the assessments or taxes shall be made defendants thereto.

## 35.50.240 - Procedure—Pleadings and evidence.
In foreclosing local improvement assessment liens, the assessment roll and the ordinance confirming it, or duly authenticated copies thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity and legality of the proceedings connected therewith and the burden of proof shall be on the defendants.

## 35.50.260 - Procedure—Trial and judgment—Notice of sale.
In foreclosing local improvement assessments the action shall be tried to the court without a jury. If the parties interested in any particular lot, tract, or parcel default, the court may enter judgment of foreclosure and sale as to such parties and lots, tracts, or parcels and the action may proceed as to the remaining defendants and lots, tracts, or parcels. Judgment and order of sale may be entered as to any one or more separate lots, tracts, or parcels involved in the action and the court shall retain jurisdiction to others.

The judgment shall specify separately the amount of the installments with interest, penalty, and all reasonable administrative costs, including, but not limited to, the title searches, chargeable to each lot, tract, or parcel. The judgment shall have the effect of a separate judgment as to each lot, tract, or parcel described in the judgment, and any appeal shall not invalidate or delay the judgment except as to the property concerning which the appeal is taken. In the judgment the court shall order the lots, tracts, or parcels therein described sold by the city or town treasurer or by the county sheriff and an order of sale shall issue pursuant thereto for the enforcement of the judgment.

In all other respects, the trial, judgment, and appeals to the supreme court or the court of appeals shall be governed by the statutes governing the foreclosure of mortgages on real property.

Prior to the sale of the property, if the property is shown on the property tax rolls under unknown owner or if the property contains a residential structure having an assessed value of two thousand dollars or more, the treasurer shall order or conduct a title search of the property to determine the record title holders and all persons claiming a mortgage, deed of trust, or mechanic's, laborer's, material supplier's, or vendor's lien on the property.

At least thirty days prior to the sale of the property, a copy of the notice of sale shall be mailed by certified and regular mail to all defendants in the foreclosure action as to that parcel, lot, or tract and, if the owner is unknown or the property contains a residential structure having an assessed value of two thousand dollars or more, a copy of the notice of sale shall be mailed by regular and certified mail to any additional record title holders and persons claiming a mortgage, deed of trust, or mechanic's, laborer's, material supplier's, or vendor's lien on the property.

In all other respects, the procedure for sale shall be conducted in the same manner as property tax sales described in RCW 84.64.080.
