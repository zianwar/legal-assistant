   b. A city or town proposing to annex territory shall initiate the interlocal agreement process by sending notice to the fire protection district representative and county representative stating the city's or town's interest to enter into an interlocal agreement negotiation process. The parties have forty-five days to respond in the affirmative or negative. A negative response must state the reasons the parties do not wish to participate in an interlocal agreement negotiation. A failure to respond within the forty-five day period is deemed an affirmative response and the interlocal agreement negotiation process may proceed. The interlocal agreement process may not proceed if any negative responses are received within the forty-five day period.

   c. The interlocal agreement must describe the boundaries of the territory proposed for annexation and must be consistent with the boundaries identified in an ordinance describing the boundaries of the territory proposed for annexation and setting a date for a public hearing on the ordinance. If the boundaries of the territory proposed for annexation are agreed to by all parties, a notice of intention must be filed with the boundary review board created under RCW 36.93.030. However, the jurisdiction of the board may not be invoked as described in RCW 36.93.100 for annexations that are the subject of such agreement.

2. An interlocal annexation agreement under this section must include the following:

   a. A statement of the goals of the agreement. Goals must include, but are not limited to:

      i. The transfer of revenues and assets between the fire protection districts and the city or town;

      ii. A consideration and discussion of the impact to the level of service of annexation on the unincorporated area, and an agreement that the impact on the ability of fire protection and emergency medical services within the incorporated area must not be negatively impacted at least through the budget cycle in which the annexation occurs;

Upon the filing of a timely and sufficient referendum petition with the legislative body of the city or town, signed by qualified electors in a number not less than ten percent of the votes cast in the last general state election in the area to be annexed, the question of annexation must be submitted to the voters of the area in a general election if one is to be held within ninety days or at a special election called for that purpose according to RCW 29A.04.330. Notice of the election must be given as provided in RCW 35.13.080, and the election must be conducted as provided in the general election laws under Title 29A RCW. The annexation must be deemed approved by the voters unless a majority of the votes cast on the proposition are in opposition to the annexation.

After the expiration of the forty-fifth day from, but excluding, the date of passage of the annexation ordinance, if a timely and sufficient referendum petition has not been filed, the area annexed becomes a part of the city or town upon the date fixed in the ordinance of annexation.

4. If any portion of a fire protection district is proposed for annexation to or incorporation into a city or town, both the fire protection district and the city or town shall jointly inform the employees of the fire protection district about hires, separations, terminations, and any other changes in employment that are a direct consequence of annexation or incorporation at the earliest reasonable opportunity.

      ii. Retirement, vacation, sick leave, and any other accrued benefit;

      iii. Promotion and service time accrual; and

      iv. The length or terms of probationary periods, including no requirement for an additional probationary period if one had been completed before the transfer date.

7. If upon transfer, the transferring employee receives the rights, benefits, and privileges established under subsection (6)(a)(i) through (iv) of this section, those rights, benefits, and privileges are subject to collective bargaining at the end of the current bargaining period for the jurisdiction to which the employee has transferred.

8. Such bargaining must take into account the years of service the transferring employee accumulated before the transfer and must be treated as if those years of service occurred in the jurisdiction to which the employee has transferred.

## 35.13.256 - Fire protection services—Benefit charge—Resolution—Exemptions—Definitions.
1. A city or town that has annexed since 2006 or is conducting annexations of all or a part of a fire protection district or fire protection districts may by resolution, for the enhancement of fire protection services, fix and impose a benefit charge on personal property and improvements to real property that are located in the city or town, to be paid by the owners of the properties: PROVIDED, That a benefit charge shall not apply to personal property and improvements to real property owned or used by: (a) Any recognized religious denomination or religious organization as, or including, a sanctuary or for purposes related to the bona fide religious ministries of the denomination or religious organization, including schools and educational facilities used for kindergarten, primary, or secondary educational purposes or for institutions of higher education and all grounds and buildings related thereto, but not including personal property and improvements to real property owned or used by any recognized religious denomination or religious organization for business operations, profit-making enterprises, or activities not including use of a sanctuary or related to kindergarten, primary, or secondary educational purposes or for institutions of higher education; or (b) any entity exempt from taxation under RCW 35.82.210, 84.36.030(3), or 84.36.560.

2. A benefit charge imposed shall be reasonably proportioned to the measurable benefits to property resulting from the enhancement of services afforded by the city or town fire department. It is acceptable to apportion the benefit charge to the values of the properties as found by the county assessor or assessors modified generally in the proportion that fire insurance rates are reduced or entitled to be reduced as the result of providing the services. Any other method that reasonably apportions the benefit charges to the actual benefits resulting from the degree of protection, which may include but is not limited to the distance from regularly maintained fire protection equipment, the level of fire prevention services provided to the properties, or the need of the properties for specialized services, may be specified in the resolution and shall be subject to contest on the ground of unreasonable or capricious action or action in excess of the measurable benefits to the property resulting from services afforded by the city or town fire department. The city or town may determine that certain properties or types or classes of properties are not receiving measurable benefits based on criteria they establish by resolution. A benefit charge authorized by this section shall not be applicable to the personal property or improvements to real property of any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, organization, or association maintaining a fire department and whose fire protection and training system has been accepted by a fire insurance underwriter maintaining a fire protection engineering and inspection service authorized by the state insurance commissioner to do business in this state, but such property may be protected by the city or town under a contractual agreement. For administrative purposes, the benefit charge imposed on any individual property may be compiled into a single charge, provided that the city or town, upon request of the property owner, provide an itemized list of charges for each measurable benefit included in the charge.

3. The resolution establishing benefit charges shall specify, by legal geographical areas or other specific designations, the charge to apply to each property by location, type, or other designation, or other information that is necessary to the proper computation of the benefit charge to be charged to each property owner subject to the resolution. The county assessor of each county shall determine and identify the personal properties and improvements to real property which are subject to a benefit charge in each city or town and shall furnish and deliver to the county treasurer of that county a listing of the properties with information describing the location, legal description, and address of the person to whom the statement of benefit charges is to be mailed, the name of the owner, and the value of the property and improvements, together with the benefit charge to apply to each. These benefit charges shall be certified to the county treasurer for collection in the same manner that is used for the collection of fire protection assessments for forestlands protected by the department of natural resources under RCW 76.04.610 and the same penalties and provisions for collection shall apply.

4. Each city and town shall contract, prior to the imposition of a benefit charge, for the administration and collection of the benefit charge by each county treasurer, who shall deduct a percent, as provided by contract to reimburse the county for expenses incurred by the county assessor and county treasurer in the administration of the resolution and this section. The county treasurer shall make distributions each year, as the charges are collected, in the amount of the benefit charges imposed on behalf of the city or town, less the deduction provided for in the contract.

5. Any benefit charge authorized by this section shall not be effective unless a proposition to impose the benefit charge is approved by a sixty percent majority of the voters of the city or town voting at a general election or at a special election called by the city or town for that purpose, held within the city or town. An election held pursuant to this section shall be held not more than twelve months prior to the date on which the first such charge is to be assessed: PROVIDED, That a benefit charge approved at an election shall not remain in effect for a period of more than six years nor more than the number of years authorized by the voters if fewer than six years unless subsequently reapproved by the voters.

6. The ballot shall be submitted so as to enable the voters favoring the authorization of a benefit charge to vote "Yes" and those opposed thereto to vote "No," and the ballot shall be:

"Shall . . . . . . . . . . be authorized to impose benefit charges each year for . . . . (insert number of years not to exceed six) years, not to exceed an amount equal to . . . . (insert percentage amount not to exceed sixty) percent of its fire department operating budget?

YESNO□□"

YES

NO

7. A city or town renewing the benefit charge may elect to use the following alternative ballot:

"Shall . . . . . . . . . . be authorized to continue voter-authorized benefit charges each year for . . . . (insert number of years not to exceed six) years, not to exceed an amount equal to . . . . (insert percentage amount not to exceed sixty) percent of its fire department operating budget?

YESNO□□"

YES

NO

□

□"

8. Not less than ten days nor more than six months before the election at which the proposition to impose the benefit charge is submitted as provided in this section, the city or town shall hold a public hearing specifically setting forth its proposal to impose benefit charges for the support of its legally authorized activities which will maintain or improve the services afforded in the city or town. A report of the public hearing shall be filed with the county treasurer of each county in which the property is located and be available for public inspection.

   c. After the benefit charges have been established, the owners of the property subject to the charge shall be notified of the amount of the charge.

10. After notice has been given to the property owners of the amount of the charge, the city or town imposing a benefit charge under this section shall form a review board for at least a two-week period and shall, upon complaint in writing of a party aggrieved owning property in the city or town, reduce the charge of a person who, in their opinion, has been charged too large a sum, to a sum or amount as they believe to be the true, fair, and just amount.

11. A person who is receiving the exemption contained in RCW 84.36.381 through 84.36.389 shall be exempt from any legal obligation to pay a portion of the charge imposed by this section according to the following:

    a. A person who meets the income limitation contained in RCW 84.36.381(5)(a) and does not meet the income limitation contained in RCW 84.36.381(5)(b) (i) or (ii) shall be exempt from twenty-five percent of the charge.

    b. A person who meets the income limitation contained in RCW 84.36.381(5)(b)(i) shall be exempt from fifty percent of the charge.

    c. A person who meets the income limitation contained in RCW 84.36.381(5)(b)(ii) shall be exempt from seventy-five percent of the charge.

12. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Personal property" includes every form of tangible personal property , including but not limited to, all goods, chattels, stock in trade, estates, or crops, except that the term "personal property" does not include any personal property used for farming, field crops, farm equipment, or livestock; and

## 35.13.300 - Boundary line adjustment—Purpose—Definition.
The purpose of RCW 35.13.300 through 35.13.330 is to establish a process for the adjustment of existing or proposed city boundary lines to avoid a situation where a common boundary line is or would be located within a right-of-way of a public street, road, or highway, or a situation where two cities are separated or would be separated by only the right-of-way of a public street, road, or highway, other than situations where a boundary line runs from one edge of the right-of-way to the other edge of the right-of-way.

As used in RCW 35.13.300 through 35.13.330, "city" includes every city or town in the state, including a code city operating under Title 35A RCW.

## 35.13.310 - Boundary line adjustment—Agreement—Not subject to review.
1. This section provides a method to adjust the boundary lines between two cities where the two cities share a common boundary within a right-of-way of a public street, road, or highway, or the two cities have a portion of their boundaries separated only by all or part of the right-of-way of a public street, road, or highway. However, this section does not apply to situations where a boundary line runs from one edge of the right-of-way to the other edge of the right-of-way.

2. The councils of any two cities in a situation described in subsection (1) of this section may enter into an agreement to alter those portions of their boundaries that are necessary to eliminate this situation and create a partial common boundary on either edge of the right-of-way of the public street, road, or highway. An agreement made under this section shall include only boundary line adjustments between the two cities that are necessary to eliminate the situation described in subsection (1) of this section.

A boundary line adjustment under this section is not subject to potential review by a boundary review board.

## 35.13.320 - Boundary line adjustment—When adjustment required—Limitation—Not subject to review.
The councils of any two cities that will be in a situation described in RCW 35.13.310(1) as the result of a proposed annexation by one of the cities may enter into an agreement to adjust those portions of the annexation proposal and the boundaries of the city that is not proposing the annexation. Such an agreement shall not be effective unless the annexation is made.

The annexation proposal shall proceed if such an agreement were not made, but any resulting boundaries between the two cities that meet the descriptions of RCW 35.13.310(1) shall be adjusted by agreement between the two cities within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of the annexation, or the county legislative authority of the county within which the right-of-way is located shall adjust the boundaries within a sixty-day period immediately following the one hundred eightieth day.

An agreement or adjustment made by a county under this section shall include only boundary line adjustments between the two cities that are necessary to eliminate the situation described in RCW 35.13.310(1).

## 35.13.330 - Boundary line adjustment—Agreement pending incorporation—Limitation—Not subject to review.
1. The purpose of this section is to avoid situations arising where the boundaries of an existing city and a newly incorporated city would create a situation described in RCW 35.13.310(1).

2. A boundary review board that reviews the boundaries of a proposed incorporation may enter into an agreement with the council of a city, that would be in a situation described in subsection (1) of this section as the result of a proposed incorporation of a city, to adjust the boundary line of the city and those of the city proposed to be incorporated to avoid this situation described in subsection (1) of this section if the incorporation were to be approved by the voters. Such an agreement shall not be effective unless the incorporation occurs.

The incorporation proposal shall proceed if such an agreement were not made, but any resulting boundaries between the two cities that meet create a situation described in RCW 35.13.310(1) shall be adjusted by agreement between the two cities within one hundred eighty days of the official date of the incorporation, or the county legislative authority of the county within which the right-of-way is located shall adjust the boundaries within a sixty-day period immediately following the one hundred eightieth day.

An agreement or adjustment made by a county under this section shall include only boundary line adjustments between the two cities that are necessary to eliminate the situation described in RCW 35.13.310(1).

## 35.13.340 - Boundary line adjustment—Inclusion or exclusion of remaining portion of parcel—When subject to review—Definition.
The boundaries of a city shall be adjusted to include or exclude the remaining portion of a parcel of land located partially within and partially without *of the boundaries of that city upon the governing body of the city adopting a resolution approving such an adjustment that was requested in a petition signed by the owner of the parcel. A boundary adjustment made pursuant to this section shall not be subject to potential review by the boundary review board of the county within which the parcel is located if the remaining portion of the parcel to be included or excluded from the city is located in the unincorporated area of the county and the adjustment is approved by resolution of the county legislative authority or in writing by a county official or employee of the county who is designated by ordinance of the county to make such approvals.

Where part of a single parcel of land is located within the boundaries of one city, and the remainder of the parcel is located within the boundaries of a second city that is located immediately adjacent to the first city, the boundaries of the two cities may be adjusted so that all of the parcel is located within either of the cities, if the adjustment was requested in a petition signed by the property owner and is approved by both cities. Approval by a city may be through either resolution of its city council, or in writing by an official or employee of the city who has been designated by ordinance of the city to make such approvals. Such an adjustment is not subject to potential review by the boundary review board of the county in which the parcel is located.

Whenever a portion of a public right-of-way is located on such a parcel, the boundary adjustment shall be made in such a manner as to include all or none of that portion of the public right-of-way within the boundaries of the city.

As used in this section, "city" shall include any city or town, including a code city.

Upon receipt of such request by the civil service commission the transfer shall be made. The employee so transferring will: (a) Be on probation for the same period as are new employees in the same classification of the police department; (b) be eligible for promotion after completion of the probationary period in compliance with existing civil service rules pertaining to lateral transfers based upon combined service time; (c) receive a salary at least equal to that of other new employees in the same classification of the police department; and (d) in all other matters, such as sick leave and vacation, have, within the civil service system, all the rights, benefits, and privileges that the employee would have been entitled to had he or she been a member of the police department from the beginning of his or her employment with the county. The county is responsible for compensating an employee for benefits accrued while employed with the sheriff's office unless a different agreement is reached between the county and the city, code city, or town. No accrued benefits are transferable to the recipient agency unless the recipient agency agrees to accept the accrued benefits. All benefits shall then accrue based on the combined seniority of each employee in the recipient agency. The county shall, upon receipt of such notice, transmit to the civil service commission a record of the employee's service with the county which shall be credited to the employee as a part of his or her period of employment in the police department. For purposes of layoffs by the city, code city, or town, only the time of service accrued with the city, code city, or town shall apply unless an agreement is reached between the collective bargaining representatives of the police department and sheriff's office employees and the police department and sheriff's office.

2. Only as many of the transferring employees shall be placed upon the payroll of the police department as the city, code city, or town determines are needed to provide an adequate level of law enforcement service. The needed employees shall be taken in order of seniority and the remaining employees who transfer as provided in RCW 35.13.360 through 35.13.400 shall head the list of their respective class or job listing exclusive of rank in the civil service system in order of their seniority, so that they shall be the first to be employed in the police department as vacancies become available. Employees who are not immediately hired by the city, code city, or town shall be placed on a reemployment list for a period not to exceed thirty-six months unless a longer period is authorized by an agreement reached between the collective bargaining representatives of the police department and sheriff's office employees and the police department and sheriff's office. The county sheriff's office must rehire former employees who are placed on the city's reemployment list before it can hire anyone else to perform the same duties previously performed by these employees who were laid off.

3. The thirty-six month period contained in subsection (2) of this section shall commence:

   a. On the effective date of the annexation in cases of annexation; and

   b. On the date when the city creates its own police department in cases of incorporation.

4. The city, code city, or town shall retain the right to select the police chief regardless of seniority.

5. The annexation ordinances provided for in RCW 35.13.470(4) and subsection (4) of this section are subject to referendum for forty-five days after passage.

7. Costs for an election required under subsection (6) of this section shall be borne by the county.

The notice must also be posted in three public places within the subject territory, specify the time and place of the hearing, and invite interested persons to appear and voice approval or disapproval of the annexation. If the annexation proposal provides for assumption of indebtedness or adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, the notice must include a statement of these requirements.

   d. If, following the conclusion of the hearing, a majority of the county legislative authority deems the annexation proposal to be in the best interest of the county, it may adopt a resolution approving of the annexation.
