## 35.61.010 - Creation—Territory included.
A metropolitan park district may be created for the management, control, improvement, maintenance, and acquisition of parks, parkways, boulevards, and recreational facilities. A metropolitan park district may include territory located in portions or all of one or more cities or counties, or one or more cities and counties, when created or enlarged as provided in this chapter.

Supp. 1943 § 6741-1; prior:  1907 c 98 § 1; RRS § 6720; \]

## 35.61.020 - Election—Resolution or petition—Area—Limitations.
1. When proposed by citizen petition or by local government resolution as provided in this section, a ballot proposition authorizing the creation of a metropolitan park district must be submitted by resolution to the voters of the area proposed to be included in the district at any general election, or at any special election which may be called for that purpose.

2. The ballot proposition must be submitted if the governing body of each city in which all or a portion of the proposed district is located, and the legislative authority of each county in which all or a portion of the proposed district is located within the unincorporated portion of the county, each adopts a resolution submitting the proposition to create a metropolitan park district.

3. As an alternative to the method provided under subsection (2) of this section, the ballot proposition must be submitted if a petition proposing creation of a metropolitan park district is submitted to the county auditor of each county in which all or a portion of the proposed district is located that is signed by at least fifteen percent of the registered voters residing in the area to be included within the proposed district. Where the petition is for creation of a district in more than one county, the petition must be filed with the county auditor of the county having the greater area of the proposed district, and a copy filed with each other county auditor of the other counties covering the proposed district.

4. Territory by virtue of its annexation to any city whose territory lies entirely within a park district are deemed to be within the limits of the metropolitan park district. Such an extension of a park district's boundaries is not subject to review by a boundary review board independent of the board's review of the city annexation of territory.

5. A city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties proposing or approving a petition regarding formation of a metropolitan park district may limit the purpose and may limit the taxing powers of such proposed metropolitan park district in its resolution in cases where the metropolitan park district is being formed for specifically identified facilities referenced in (a) of this subsection. The ballot proposition must reflect such limitations as follows:

   a. A city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties may limit the proposed district's purposes to providing the funds necessary to acquire, construct, renovate, expand, operate, maintain, and provide programming for specifically identified public parks or recreational facilities that are otherwise authorized by law for metropolitan park districts. The ballot proposition must specifically identify those public parks or recreational facilities to be funded, which identification may be made by referencing a metropolitan park district plan that has been approved by the legislative authority of the city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties proposing the formation of the district;

   b. A city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties may limit the maximum levy rate that is available to such metropolitan park district to any levy rate that does not exceed the aggregate rate set forth under RCW 35.61.210(1). The ballot proposition must state the maximum regular levy rate.

6. Nothing herein prevents a city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties from proposing formation of a metropolitan park district that is not limited under subsection (5) of this section.

## 35.61.030 - Election—Review by boundary review board—Question stated.
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section for review by a boundary review board, the ballot proposition authorizing creation of a metropolitan park district that is submitted to voters for their approval or rejection shall appear on the ballot of the next general election or at the next special election date specified under RCW 29A.04.330 occurring sixty or more days after the last resolution proposing the creation of the park district is adopted or the date the county auditor certifies that the petition proposing the creation of the park district contains sufficient valid signatures. Where the petition or copy thereof is filed with two or more county auditors in the case of a proposed district in two or more counties, the county auditors shall confer and issue a joint certification upon finding that the required number of signatures on the petition has been obtained.

2. Where the proposed district is located wholly or in part in a county in which a boundary review board has been created, notice of the proposal to create a metropolitan park district shall be filed with the boundary review board as provided under RCW 36.93.090 and the special election at which a ballot proposition authorizing creation of the park district shall be held on the special election date specified under RCW 29A.04.330 that is sixty or more days after the date the boundary review board is deemed to have approved the proposal, approves the proposal, or modifies and approves the proposal. The creation of a metropolitan park district is not subject to review by a boundary review board if the proposed district only includes one or more cities and in such cases the special election at which a ballot proposition authorizing creation of the park district shall be held as if a boundary review board does not exist in the county or counties.

3. The petition proposing the creation of a metropolitan park district, or the resolution submitting the question to the voters, shall choose and describe the composition of the initial board of commissioners of the district that is proposed under RCW 35.61.050 and shall choose a name for the district.

## 35.61.040 - Election—Creation of district—Bridge loan, line of credit.
If a majority of the voters voting on the ballot proposition authorizing the creation of the metropolitan park district vote in favor of the formation of a metropolitan park district, the metropolitan park district must be created as a municipal corporation effective immediately upon certification of the election results and its name must be that designated in the ballot proposition. When an ex officio treasurer of a metropolitan park district is a city or county treasurer, the treasurer may provide a bridge loan or line of credit to the newly formed metropolitan park district until such time as the district has received sufficient levy proceeds to pay for the maintenance and operations of the metropolitan park district.

1. The resolution or petition submitting the ballot proposition shall designate the composition of the board of metropolitan park commissioners from among the alternatives provided under subsections (2) through (4) of this section. The ballot proposition shall clearly describe the designated composition of the board.

2. The commissioners of the district may be selected by election, in which case at the same election at which the proposition is submitted to the voters as to whether a metropolitan park district is to be formed, five park commissioners shall be elected. The election of park commissioners shall be null and void if the metropolitan park district is not created. Candidates shall run for specific commission positions. No primary shall be held to nominate candidates. The person receiving the greatest number of votes for each position shall be elected as a commissioner. The staggering of the terms of office shall occur as follows: (a) The two persons who are elected receiving the two greatest numbers of votes shall be elected to six-year terms of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or five-year terms of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year; (b) the two persons who are elected receiving the next two greatest numbers of votes shall be elected to four-year terms of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or three-year terms of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year; and (c) the other person who is elected shall be elected to a two-year term of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or a one-year term of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year. The initial commissioners shall take office immediately when they are elected and qualified, and for purposes of computing their terms of office the terms shall be assumed to commence on the first day of January in the year after they are elected. Thereafter, all commissioners shall be elected to six-year terms of office. All commissioners shall serve until their respective successors are elected and qualified and assume office in accordance with RCW 29A.60.280. Vacancies shall occur and shall be filled as provided in chapter 42.12 RCW.

3. In a district wholly located within a city or within the unincorporated area of a county, the governing body of such city or legislative authority of such county may be designated to serve in an ex officio capacity as the board of metropolitan park commissioners, provided that when creation of the district is proposed by citizen petition, the city or county approves by resolution such designation.

4. Where the proposed district is located within more than one city, more than one county, or any combination of cities and counties, each city governing body and county legislative authority may be designated to collectively serve ex officio as the board of metropolitan park commissioners through selection of one or more members from each to serve as the board, provided that when creation of the district is proposed by citizen petition, each city governing body and county legislative authority approve by resolution such designation. Within six months of the date of certification of election results approving creation of the district, the size and membership of the board shall be determined through interlocal agreement of each city and county. The interlocal agreement shall specify the method for filling vacancies on the board.

5. Metropolitan park districts created by a vote of the people prior to June 13, 2002, may not change the composition and method of selection of their governing authority without approval of the voters. Should such a change be desired, the board of park commissioners shall submit a ballot proposition to the voters of the metropolitan park district.

The notice shall state generally the work to be done and shall call for proposals for doing the same to be sealed and filed with the board of park commissioners on or before the day and hour named therein.

Each bid shall be accompanied by a certified or cashier's check or postal money order payable to the order of the metropolitan park district for a sum not less than five percent of the amount of the bid, or accompanied by a bid bond in an amount not less than five percent of the bid with a corporate surety licensed to do business in the state, conditioned that the bidder will pay the metropolitan park district as liquidated damages the amount specified in the bond, unless the bidder enters into a contract in accordance with the bidder's bid, and no bid shall be considered unless accompanied by such check, cash, or bid bond. At the time and place named such bids shall be publicly opened and read and the board of park commissioners shall proceed to canvass the bids and may let such contract to the lowest responsible bidder upon plans and specifications on file or to the best bidder submitting the bidder's own plans and specifications. The board of park commissioners may reject all bids for good cause and readvertise and in such case all checks, cash, or bid bonds shall be returned to the bidders. If the contract is let, then all checks, cash, or bid bonds shall be returned to the bidders, except that of the successful bidder, which shall be retained until a contract is entered into for doing the work, and a bond to perform such work furnished with sureties satisfactory to the board of park commissioners in the full amount of the contract price between the bidder and the metropolitan park district in accordance with the bid. If the bidder fails to enter into the contract in accordance with the bid and furnish the bond within ten days from the date at which the bidder is notified that the bidder is the successful bidder, the check, cash, or bid bonds and the amount thereof shall be forfeited to the metropolitan park district. If the bidder fails to enter into a contract in accordance with the bidder's bid, and the board of park commissioners deems it necessary to take legal action to collect on any bid bond required by this section, then the metropolitan park district is entitled to collect from the bidder any legal expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees occasioned thereby. A low bidder who claims error and fails to enter into a contract is prohibited from bidding on the same project if a second or subsequent call for bids is made for the project.

2. As an alternative to requirements under subsection (1) of this section, a metropolitan park district may let contracts using the small works roster process under RCW 39.04.155.

3. Any purchase of materials, supplies, or equipment, with an estimated cost in excess of forty thousand dollars, shall be by contract. Any purchase of materials, supplies, or equipment, with an estimated cost of less than fifty thousand dollars shall be made using the process provided in RCW 39.04.190. Any purchase of materials, supplies, or equipment with an estimated cost of fifty thousand dollars or more shall be made by competitive bidding following the procedure for letting contracts for projects under subsection (1) of this section.

4. As an alternative to requirements under subsection (3) of this section, a metropolitan park district may let contracts for purchase of materials, supplies, or equipment with the suppliers designated on current state agency, county, city, or town purchasing rosters for the materials, supplies, or equipment, when the roster has been established in accordance with the competitive bidding law for purchases applicable to the state agency, county, city, or town. The price and terms for purchases shall be as described on the applicable roster.

5. The park board may waive the competitive bidding requirements of this section pursuant to RCW 39.04.280 if an exemption contained within RCW 39.04.280 applies to the purchase or public work.

2. The civil service commission and personnel officer shall adopt rules to be known as civil service rules to govern the administration of personnel transactions and procedure.

The dollar thresholds established in this subsection (3) must be adjusted for inflation by the office of financial management every five years, beginning January 1, 2024, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. "Consumer price index" means, for any calendar year, that year's annual average consumer price index, for Washington state, for wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the bureau of labor and statistics, United States department of labor. If the bureau of labor and statistics develops more than one consumer price index for areas within the state, the index covering the greatest number of people, covering areas exclusively within the boundaries of the state, and including all items shall be used for the adjustments for inflation in this section. The office of financial management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the office of the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect.

4. A person holding office as commissioner for two or more special purpose districts shall receive only that per diem compensation authorized for one of his or her commissioner positions as compensation for attending an official meeting or conducting official services or duties while representing more than one of his or her districts.

In addition, the board of park commissioners may levy or cause to be levied a general tax on all property located in said park district each year not to exceed twenty-five cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation. Although park districts are authorized to impose two separate regular property tax levies, the levies are considered to be a single levy for purposes of the limitation provided for in chapter 84.55 RCW.

2. The maximum levy rate of a metropolitan park district formed subject to the limitations set forth in RCW 35.61.020(5) must be the levy rate set forth in the ballot proposition. At any time after the initial formation of a district subject to a limitation under RCW 35.61.020(5), the board of metropolitan park commissioners may submit to the voters of the district at a general or special election a proposition to alter such maximum regular levy rate, which proposition becomes effective only upon approval by a majority of the votes cast on the proposition. The limitations provided in chapter 84.55 RCW do not apply in the first year after the approval of any proposition under this subsection.

3. The board is hereby authorized to levy a general tax in excess of its regular property tax levy or levies when authorized so to do at a special election conducted in accordance with and subject to all the requirements of the Constitution and laws of the state now in force or hereafter enacted governing the limitation of tax levies. The board is hereby authorized to call a special election for the purpose of submitting to the qualified voters of the park district a proposition to levy a tax in excess of the regular levy rates authorized for the district under subsection (1) or (2) of this section. The manner of submitting any such proposition, of certifying the same, and of giving or publishing notice thereof, must be as provided by law for the submission of propositions by cities, towns, or counties.

4.
