## 35.55.010 - Authority—Second-class cities.
If the city council of any city of the second class deems it necessary or expedient on account of the public health, sanitation, the general welfare, or other cause, to fill or raise the grade of any marshlands, swamplands, tidelands, shorelands, or lands commonly known as tideflats, or any other lowlands situated within the limits of the city, and to clear and prepare the lands for such filling, it may do so and assess the expense thereof, including the cost of making compensation for property taken or damaged, and all other costs and expense incidental to such improvement, to the property benefited, except such amount of such expense as the city council may direct to be paid out of the current or general expense fund.

If, in the judgment of the city council the special benefits for any such improvement shall extend beyond the boundaries of the filled area, the council may create an enlarged district which shall include, as near as may be, all the property, whether actually filled or not, which will be specially benefited by such improvement, and in such case the council shall specify and describe the boundaries of such enlarged district in the ordinance providing for such improvement and shall specify that such portion of the total cost and expense of such improvement as may not be borne by the current or general expense fund, shall be distributed and assessed against all the property of such enlarged district.

\[ [1994 c 81 § 57](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2244.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%2081%20§%2057); [1965 c 7 § 35.55.010](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.55.010); [1917 c 63 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1917c63.pdf?cite=1917%20c%2063%20§%201); [1909 c 147 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c147.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20147%20§%201); RRS § 9432; \]

## 35.55.020 - Alternative methods of financing.
If the city council desires to make any improvement authorized by the provisions of this chapter it shall provide therefor by ordinance and unless the ordinance provides that the improvement shall be paid for wholly or in part by special assessments upon the property benefited, compensation therefor shall be made from any general funds of the city applicable thereto. If the ordinance provides that the improvement shall be paid for wholly or in part by special assessments upon property benefited, the proceedings for the making of the special assessments shall be as hereinafter provided.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.55.020](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.55.020); 1909 c 147 § 2, part; RRS § 9433, part; \]

## 35.55.030 - Boundaries—Excepted property.
Such ordinance shall specify the boundaries of the proposed improvement district and shall describe the lands which it is proposed to assess for said improvement. If any parcel of land within the boundaries of such proposed improvement district has been wholly filled to the proposed grade elevation of the proposed fill, such parcel of land may be excluded from the lists of lands to be assessed, when in the opinion of the city council justice and equity require its exclusion. The boundaries of any improvement district may be altered so as to exclude land therefrom at any time up to the levying of the assessment but such changing of the boundaries shall be by ordinance.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.55.030](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.55.030); 1909 c 147 § 2, part; RRS § 9433, part; \]

## 35.55.040 - Damages—Eminent domain.
If an ordinance has been passed as in this chapter provided, and it appears that in making of the improvement so authorized, private property will be taken or damaged thereby, the city shall file a petition in the superior court of the county in which such city is situated, in the name of the city, praying that just compensation to be made for the property to be taken or damaged for the improvement specified in the ordinance be ascertained, and conduct proceedings in eminent domain in accordance with the statutes relating to cities for the ascertainment of the compensation to be made for the taking and damaging of property, except insofar as the same may be inconsistent with this chapter.

The filling of unimproved and uncultivated lowlands of the character mentioned in RCW 35.55.010 shall not be considered as damaging or taking of such lands. The damage if any, done to cultivated lands or growing crops thereon, or to buildings and other improvements situated within the district proposed to be filled, shall be ascertained and determined in the manner above provided; but no damage shall be awarded to any property owner for buildings or improvements placed upon lands included within said district after the publication of the ordinance defining the boundaries of the proposed improvement district: PROVIDED, That the city shall after the passage of such ordinance, proceed with said improvement with due diligence. If the improvement is to be made at the expense of the property benefited, no account shall be taken of benefits by the jury or court in assessing the amount of compensation to be made to the owner of any property within such district, but such compensation shall be assessed without regard to benefits to the end that said property for which damages may be so awarded, may be assessed the same as other property within the district for its just share and proportion of the expense of making said improvement, and the fact that compensation has been awarded for the damaging or taking of any parcel of land shall not preclude the assessment of such parcel of land for its just proportion of said improvement.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.55.040](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.55.040); [1909 c 147 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c147.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20147%20§%203); RRS § 9434; \]

## 35.55.050 - Estimates—Plans and specifications.
At the time of the initiation of the proceedings for any improvement as contemplated by this chapter, or at any time afterward, the city council shall cause plans and specifications for said improvement to be prepared and shall cause an estimate to be made of the cost and expense of making said improvement, including the cost of supervision and engineering, abstractor's fees, interest and discounts and all other expenses incidental to said improvement, including an estimate of the amount of damages for property taken or damaged, which plans, specifications and estimates shall be approved by the city council.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.55.050](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.55.050); [1909 c 147 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c147.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20147%20§%204); RRS § 9435; \]

## 35.55.060 - Assessment roll—Items—Assessment units—Installments.
When such plans and specifications have been prepared and the estimates of the cost and expense of making the improvement have been adopted by the council and when an estimate has been made of the compensation to be paid for property damaged or taken, either before or after the compensation has been ascertained in the eminent domain proceedings, the city council shall cause an assessment roll to be prepared containing a list of all of the property within the improvement district which it is proposed to assess for the improvement, together with the names of the owners, if known, and if unknown the property shall be assessed to an unknown owner, and opposite each description shall be set the amount assessed to such description.

When so ordered by the council, the entire amount of compensation paid or to be paid for property damaged or taken, including all of the costs and expenses incidental to the condemnation proceedings together with the entire cost and expense of making the improvement, may be assessed against the property within the district subject to assessment, but the council may order any portion of the costs paid out of the current or general expense fund of the city.

The assessments shall be made according to and in proportion to surface area one square foot of surface to be the unit of assessment, except that the several parcels of land in any enlarged district not actually filled shall be assessed in accordance with special benefits: PROVIDED, That where any parcel of land was partially filled by the owner prior to the initiation of the improvement, an equitable deduction for such partial filling may be allowed.

The cost and expense incidental to the filling of the streets, alleys and public places within such assessment district shall be borne by the private property within such district subject to assessment when so ordered by the council. When the assessments are payable in installments, the assessment roll when equalized, shall show the number of installments and the amounts thereof. The assessments may be made payable in any number of equal annual installments not exceeding ten in number.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.55.060](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.55.060); [1917 c 63 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1917c63.pdf?cite=1917%20c%2063%20§%202); [1909 c 147 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c147.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20147%20§%205); RRS § 9436; \]

## 35.55.150 - Local improvement fund—Investment.
If money accumulates in an improvement fund and is likely to lie idle awaiting the maturity of the bonds against the district, the city council, under proper safeguards, may invest it temporarily, or may borrow it temporarily, at a reasonable rate of interest, but when so invested or borrowed, the city shall be responsible and liable for the restoration to such fund of the money so invested or borrowed with interest thereon, whenever required for the redemption of bonds maturing against such district.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.55.150](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.55.150); [1909 c 147 § 15](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c147.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20147%20§%2015); RRS § 9446; \]

## 35.55.160 - Letting contract for improvement—Excess or deficiency of fund.
The contract for the making of the improvement may be let either before or after the making up of the equalization of the assessment roll, and warrants, or bonds may be issued against the local improvement district fund either before or after the equalization of the roll as in the judgment of the council may best subserve the public interest.

If, after the assessment roll is made up and equalized, based in whole or in part upon an estimate of the cost of the improvement, and it is found that the estimate was too high, the excess shall be rebated pro rata to the property owners on the assessment roll, the rebates to be deducted from the last installment, or installments, when the assessment is upon the installment plan.

If it is found that the estimated cost was too low and that the actual bona fide cost of the improvement is greater than the estimate, the city council, after due notice and a hearing, as in case of the original equalization of the roll, may add the required additional amount to the assessment roll to be apportioned among the several parcels of property upon the same rules and principles as if it had been originally included, except that the additional amount shall be added to the last installment of an assessment if assessments are payable upon the installment plan. The same notice shall be required for adding to the assessment roll in this manner as is required for the original equalization of the roll, and the property owner shall have the right of appeal.
