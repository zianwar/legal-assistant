## 35.71.020 - Establishment declared public purpose—Authority to establish—General powers.
The establishment of pedestrian malls is declared to be for a public purpose. Any corporate authority, by ordinance, may establish and regulate any street right-of-way as a mall, may prohibit, in whole or in part, vehicular traffic on a mall, and may provide for the acquisition of any interest in the right-of-way necessary to its establishment, and may provide for the determination of legal damages, if any, to abutting property.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.020](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.020); [1961 c 111 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%202); \]

Any corporate authority is authorized to limit the utilization of any right-of-way, except for utilities and governmental functions, provided adequate alternative routes for vehicular movement, and the loading and unloading of goods are established or are available. The abutting property owner's right of ingress and egress shall be considered to have been satisfied whenever the corporate authority has planned and constructed, or there is available, an alternate route, alleyway, and service driveway.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.030](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.030); [1961 c 111 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%203); \]

After the plans have been prepared, the corporate authority shall hold a public hearing thereon, giving notice of time and place at least two weeks in advance of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and as required by *chapter 42.32 RCW.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.040](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.040); [1961 c 111 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%204); \]

## 35.71.060 - Financing methods.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.070](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.070); [1961 c 111 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%207); \]

## 35.71.080 - Vacating, replatting right-of-way for mall purposes.
The corporate authority, as an alternate to the preceding methods, may find that the right-of-way no longer is needed as a right-of-way.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.080](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.080); [1961 c 111 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%208); \]

## 35.71.090 - "Mall organization"—Powers in general—Directors—Officers.
The corporate authority may cause an organization of persons to be known as a "Mall organization" interested in creating a mall in a given area to be formed to provide for consultative assistance to the city with respect to the establishment and administration of a mall. This organization may elect a board of directors of not less than three nor more than twelve members. The board shall elect a president, a vice president, and a secretary from its membership.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.090](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.090); [1961 c 111 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%209); \]

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.100](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.100); [1961 c 111 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%2010); \]

## 35.71.110 - Claims for damages.
Following the public hearing on the ordinance to establish a mall any person owning or having any legal or equitable interest in property which might be affected by reason of the establishment of the proposed mall or the board of directors of a mall organization shall, within twenty days of such hearing, file with the city clerk a statement describing the real property as to which the claim is made, the nature of the claimant's interest therein, the nature of the alleged damage thereto and the amount of damages claimed. After the receipt thereof, the corporate authority may negotiate with the affected parties concerning them or deny them.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.110](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.110); [1961 c 111 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%2011); \]

## 35.71.120 - Contracts with mall organization for administration—Conflicting charter provisions.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.120](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.120); [1961 c 111 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%2012); \]

## 35.71.130 - Election to discontinue mall—Ordinance—Outstanding obligations—Restoration to former status.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.71.130](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.71.130); [1961 c 111 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c111.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20111%20§%2013); \]
