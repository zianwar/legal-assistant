## 35.58.010 - Declaration of policy and purpose.
It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state of Washington to provide for the people of the populous metropolitan areas in the state the means of obtaining essential services not adequately provided by existing agencies of local government. The growth of urban population and the movement of people into suburban areas has created problems of water pollution abatement, garbage disposal, water supply, transportation, planning, parks and parkways which extend beyond the boundaries of cities, counties and special districts. For reasons of topography, location and movement of population, and land conditions and development, one or more of these problems cannot be adequately met by the individual cities, counties and districts of many metropolitan areas.

It is the purpose of this chapter to enable cities and counties to act jointly to meet these common problems in order that the proper growth and development of the metropolitan areas of the state may be assured and the health and welfare of the people residing therein may be secured.

The studies and plan may cover territory within and without the metropolitan municipal corporation. A recommended comprehensive plan prepared pursuant to this section for any metropolitan function may not be adopted by the metropolitan council unless the metropolitan municipal corporation shall have been authorized to perform such function.

If the metropolitan council shall determine that the performance of such function requires enlargement of the metropolitan area, such resolution shall contain a description of the boundaries of the proposed metropolitan area and may be adopted only after a public hearing thereon before the council. Notice of such hearing shall be published once a week for at least two consecutive weeks in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the proposed metropolitan area. The notice shall contain a description of the boundaries of the proposed metropolitan area, shall name the additional function or functions to be performed and shall state the time and place of the hearing and the fact that any changes in the boundaries of the proposed metropolitan area will be considered at such time and place. At such hearing any interested person may appear and be heard. The council may make such changes in the proposed metropolitan area as they shall deem reasonable and proper, but may not delete any portion of the existing metropolitan area and may not delete any portion of the proposed additional area which will create an island of included or excluded lands. If the council shall determine that the proposed additional area should be further enlarged, a second hearing shall be held and notice given in the same manner as for the original hearing. The council may adjourn the hearing or hearings from time to time.

Following the conclusion of such hearing or hearings the council may adopt a resolution fixing the boundaries of the proposed metropolitan area and calling a special election on the performance of such additional function. If the metropolitan municipal corporation is then authorized to perform the function of metropolitan sewage disposal the council may provide in such resolution that local governmental agencies collecting sewage from areas outside the metropolitan area as same is constituted on the date of adoption of such resolution will not thereafter be required to discharge such sewage into the metropolitan sewer system or to secure approval of local construction plans from the metropolitan municipal corporation unless such local agency shall first have entered into a contract with the metropolitan municipal corporation for the disposal of such sewage. The metropolitan council may also provide in such resolution that the authorization to perform such additional function be effective only if the voters at such election also authorize the issuance of any general obligation bonds required to carry out the recommended comprehensive plan.

The resolution calling such election shall fix the form of the ballot proposition and the same may vary from that specified in RCW 35.58.100. If the metropolitan council shall find that the issuance of general obligation bonds is necessary to perform such additional function and to carry out such recommended comprehensive plan then the ballot proposition shall set forth the principal amount of such bonds and the maximum maturity thereof and the proposition shall be so worded that the voters may by a single yes or no vote authorize the performance of the designated function in the area described in the resolution and the issuance of such general obligation bonds.

The persons voting at such election shall be all of the qualified voters who have resided within the boundaries of the proposed metropolitan area for at least thirty days preceding the date of the election. The election shall be conducted and canvassed as provided in RCW 35.58.090.

If the resolution calling such election does not require the approval of general obligation bonds as a condition of the performance of such additional function and if a majority of the persons voting on the ballot proposition residing within the existing metropolitan municipal corporation shall vote in favor thereof and a majority of the persons residing within the area proposed to be added to the existing metropolitan municipal corporation shall vote in favor thereof the boundaries described in the resolution calling the election shall become the boundaries of the metropolitan municipal corporation and the metropolitan municipal corporation shall be authorized to perform the additional function described in the proposition.

If the resolution calling such election shall require the authorization of general obligation bonds as a condition of the performance of such additional function, then to be effective the ballot proposition must be approved as provided in the preceding paragraph and must also be approved by at least three-fifths of the persons voting thereon and the number of persons voting on such proposition must constitute not less than forty percent of the total number of votes cast within such area at the last preceding state general election.

## 35.58.116 - Proposition for issuance of general obligation bonds or levy of general tax—Submission at same election or special election.
The metropolitan council may at the same election called to authorize the performance of an additional function or at a special election called by the council after it has been authorized to perform any metropolitan function submit a proposition for the issuance of general obligation bonds for capital purposes as provided in RCW 35.58.450 or a proposition for the levy of a general tax for any authorized purpose for one year in such total dollar amount as the metropolitan council may determine and specify in such proposition. Any such proposition to be effective must be assented to by at least three-fifths of the persons voting thereon and the number of persons voting on such proposition shall constitute not less than forty percent of the total number of votes cast within the metropolitan area at the last preceding state general election. Any such proposition shall only be effective if the performance of the additional function shall be authorized at such election or shall have been authorized prior thereto.

## 35.58.120 - Metropolitan council—Composition.
Unless the rights, powers, functions, and obligations of a metropolitan municipal corporation have been assumed by a county as provided in chapter 36.56 RCW, a metropolitan municipal corporation shall be governed by a metropolitan council composed of elected officials of the component counties and component cities, and possibly other persons, as determined by agreement of each of the component counties and the component cities equal in number to at least twenty-five percent of the total number of component cities that have at least seventy-five percent of the combined component city populations. The agreement shall remain in effect until altered in the same manner as the initial composition is determined.

## 35.58.410 - Budget—Expenditures—Revenue estimates—Requirements for a county assuming the powers of a metropolitan municipal corporation.
1. On or before the third Monday in June of each year, each metropolitan municipal corporation shall adopt a budget for the following calendar year. Such budget shall include a separate section for each authorized metropolitan function. Expenditures shall be segregated as to operation and maintenance expenses and capital and betterment outlays. Administrative and other expense general to the corporation shall be allocated between the authorized metropolitan functions. The budget shall contain an estimate of all revenues to be collected during the following budget year, including any surplus funds remaining unexpended from the preceding year. The metropolitan council shall not be required to confine capital or betterment expenditures made from bond proceeds or emergency expenditures to items provided in the budget. The affirmative vote of three-fourths of all members of the metropolitan council shall be required to authorize emergency expenditures.

2. Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to a county that has assumed the rights, powers, functions, and obligations of a metropolitan municipal corporation under chapter 36.56 RCW. This subsection (2) shall apply only to each county that has assumed the rights, powers, functions, and obligations of a metropolitan municipal corporation under chapter 36.56 RCW.

Each county that has assumed the rights, powers, functions, and obligations of a metropolitan municipal corporation under chapter 36.56 RCW shall, on or before the third Monday in June of each year, prepare an estimate of all revenues to be collected during the following calendar year, including any surplus funds remaining unexpended from the preceding year for each authorized metropolitan function.

If, despite the continued imposition of those taxes, the estimate of revenues made on or before the third Monday in June shows that estimated revenues will be insufficient to make all debt service payments falling due in the following calendar year on all general obligation indebtedness issued by the metropolitan municipal corporation prior to the assumption by the county of the rights, powers, functions, and obligations of the metropolitan municipal corporation, the remaining amount required to make the debt service payments shall be designated as "supplemental income" and shall be obtained from component cities and component counties as provided under RCW 35.58.420.

The county shall prepare and adopt a budget each year in accordance with applicable general law or county charter. If supplemental income has been designated under this subsection, the supplemental income shall be reflected in the budget that is adopted. If during the budget year the actual tax revenues from the taxes imposed under the authority of RCW 82.14.045 and * 35.58.273(4) exceed the estimates upon which the supplemental income was based, the difference shall be refunded to the component cities and component counties in proportion to their payments promptly after the end of the budget year. A county that has assumed the rights, powers, functions, and obligations of a metropolitan municipal corporation under chapter 36.56 RCW shall not be required to confine capital or betterment expenditures for authorized metropolitan functions from bond proceeds or emergency expenditures to items provided in the budget.

## 35.58.450 - General obligation bonds—Issuance, sale, form, term, election, payment.
Notwithstanding the limitations of chapter 39.36 RCW and any other statutory limitations otherwise applicable and limiting municipal debt, a metropolitan municipal corporation shall have the power to contract indebtedness and issue general obligation bonds and to pledge the full faith and credit of the corporation to the payment thereof, for any authorized capital purpose of the metropolitan municipal corporation, not to exceed an amount, together with any outstanding nonvoter approved general indebtedness, equal to three-fourths of one percent of the value of the taxable property within the metropolitan municipal corporation, as the term "value of the taxable property" is defined in RCW 39.36.015. A metropolitan municipal corporation may additionally contract indebtedness and issue general obligation bonds, for any authorized capital purpose of a metropolitan municipal corporation, together with any other outstanding general indebtedness, not to exceed an amount equal to five percent of the value of the taxable property within the corporation, as the term "value of the taxable property" is defined in RCW 39.36.015, when a proposition authorizing the indebtedness has been approved by three-fifths of the persons voting on said proposition at said election at which such election the total number of persons voting on such bond proposition shall constitute not less than forty percent of the total number of voters voting within the area of said metropolitan municipal corporation at the last preceding state general election. Such general obligation bonds may be authorized in any total amount in one or more propositions and the amount of such authorization may exceed the amount of bonds which could then lawfully be issued. Such bonds may be issued in one or more series from time to time out of such authorization. The elections shall be held pursuant to RCW 39.36.050.

Whenever the voters of a metropolitan municipal corporation have, pursuant to RCW 84.52.056, approved excess property tax levies to retire such bond issues, both the principal of and interest on such general obligation bonds may be made payable from annual tax levies to be made upon all the taxable property within the metropolitan municipal corporation in excess of the constitutional and/or statutory tax limit.

## 35.58.460 - Revenue bonds—Issuance, sale, form, term, payment, reserves, actions.
1. A metropolitan municipal corporation may issue revenue bonds to provide funds to carry out its authorized metropolitan water pollution abatement, water supply, garbage disposal or transportation purposes, without submitting the matter to the voters of the metropolitan municipal corporation. The metropolitan council shall create a special fund or funds for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds of each such issue, into which fund or funds the metropolitan council may obligate the metropolitan municipal corporation to pay such amounts of the gross revenue of the particular utility constructed, acquired, improved, added to, or repaired out of the proceeds of sale of such bonds, as the metropolitan council shall determine and may obligate the metropolitan municipal corporation to pay such amounts out of otherwise unpledged revenue which may be derived from the ownership, use or operation of properties or facilities owned, used or operated incident to the performance of the authorized function for which such bonds are issued or out of otherwise unpledged fees, tolls, charges, tariffs, fares, rentals, special taxes or other sources of payment lawfully authorized for such purpose, as the metropolitan council shall determine. The principal of, and interest on, such bonds shall be payable only out of such special fund or funds, and the owners of such bonds shall have a lien and charge against the gross revenue of such utility or any other revenue, fees, tolls, charges, tariffs, fares, special taxes or other authorized sources pledged to the payment of such bonds.

Such revenue bonds and the interest thereon issued against such fund or funds shall be a valid claim of the owners thereof only as against such fund or funds and the revenue pledged therefor, and shall not constitute a general indebtedness of the metropolitan municipal corporation.

Each such revenue bond shall state upon its face that it is payable from such special fund or funds, and all revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall be negotiable securities within the provisions of the law of this state. Such revenue bonds may be registered either as to principal only or as to principal and interest as provided in RCW 39.46.030, or may be bearer bonds; shall be in such denominations as the metropolitan council shall deem proper; shall be payable at such time or times and at such places as shall be determined by the metropolitan council; shall bear interest at such rate or rates as shall be determined by the metropolitan council; shall be signed by the chair and attested by the secretary of the metropolitan council, any of which signatures may be facsimile signatures, and the seal of the metropolitan municipal corporation shall be impressed or imprinted thereon; any attached interest coupons shall be signed by the facsimile signatures of said officials.

Such revenue bonds shall be sold in such manner, at such price and at such rate or rates of interest as the metropolitan council shall deem to be for the best interests of the metropolitan municipal corporation, either at public or private sale.

The metropolitan council may at the time of the issuance of such revenue bonds make such covenants with the owners of said bonds as it may deem necessary to secure and guarantee the payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, including but not being limited to covenants to set aside adequate reserves to secure or guarantee the payment of such principal and interest, to maintain rates sufficient to pay such principal and interest and to maintain adequate coverage over debt service, to appoint a trustee or trustees for the bond owners to safeguard the expenditure of the proceeds of sale of such bonds and to fix the powers and duties of such trustee or trustees and to make such other covenants as the metropolitan council may deem necessary to accomplish the most advantageous sale of such bonds. The metropolitan council may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source may later be issued on a parity with revenue bonds being issued and sold.

The metropolitan council may include in the principal amount of any such revenue bond issue an amount to establish necessary reserves, an amount for working capital and an amount necessary for interest during the period of construction of any such metropolitan facilities plus six months. The metropolitan council may, if it deems it to the best interest of the metropolitan municipal corporation, provide in any contract for the construction or acquisition of any metropolitan facilities or additions or improvements thereto or replacements or extensions thereof that payment therefor shall be made only in such revenue bonds at the par value thereof.
