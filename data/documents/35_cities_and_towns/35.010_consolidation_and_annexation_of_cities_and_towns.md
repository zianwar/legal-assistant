## 35.10.001 - Actions subject to review by boundary review board.
Actions taken under chapter 35.10 RCW may be subject to potential review by a boundary review board under chapter 36.93 RCW.

\[ [1989 c 84 § 27](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c84.pdf?cite=1989%20c%2084%20§%2027); \]

## 35.10.203 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish clear and uniform provisions of law governing the consolidation of all types and classes of cities.

\[ [1985 c 281 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c281.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20281%20§%201); \]

## 35.10.207 - "City" defined.
As used in this chapter, the term "city" means any city or town.

\[ [1985 c 281 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c281.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20281%20§%202); \]

## 35.10.217 - Methods for annexation.
The following methods are available for the annexation of all or a part of a city or town to another city or town:

1. A petition for an election to vote upon the annexation, which proposed annexation is approved by the legislative body of the city or town from which the territory will be taken, may be submitted to the legislative body of the city or town to which annexation is proposed. An annexation under this subsection shall otherwise conform with the requirements for and procedures of a petition and election method of annexing unincorporated territory under chapter 35.13 RCW, except for the requirement for the approval of the annexation by the city or town from which the territory would be taken.

2. The legislative body of a city or town may on its own initiative by resolution indicate its desire to be annexed to a city or town either in whole or in part, or the legislative body of a city or town proposing to annex all or part of another city or town may initiate the annexation by adopting a resolution indicating that desire. In case such resolution is passed, such resolution shall be transmitted to the other affected city or town. The annexation is effective if the other city or town adopts a resolution concurring in the annexation, unless the owners of property in the area proposed to be annexed, equal in value to sixty percent or more of the assessed valuation of the property in the area, protest the proposed annexation in writing to the legislative body of the city or town proposing to annex the area, within thirty days of the adoption of the second resolution accepting the annexation. Notices of the public hearing at which the second resolution is adopted shall be mailed to the owners of the property within the area proposed to be annexed in the same manner that notices of a hearing on a proposed local improvement district are required to be mailed by a city or town as provided in chapter 35.43 RCW. An annexation under this subsection shall be potentially subject to review by a boundary review board or other annexation review board after the adoption of the initial resolution, and the second resolution may not be adopted until the proposed annexation has been approved by the board.

3. The owners of property located in a city or town may petition for annexation to another city or town. An annexation under this subsection shall conform with the requirements for and procedures of a direct petition method of annexing unincorporated territory, except that the legislative body of the city or town from which the territory would be taken must approve the annexation before it may proceed.

4. All annexations under this section are subject to potential review by the local boundary review board or annexation review board.

In an election on the question of the annexation of all or a part of a city to another city, the votes cast in the city or portion thereof to be annexed shall be canvassed, and if a majority of the votes cast be in favor of annexation, the results shall be included in a statement indicating the total number of votes cast.

A proposition for the assumption of indebtedness outside the constitutional and/or statutory limits by the other city or cities in which the indebtedness did not originate shall be deemed approved if a majority of at least three-fifths of the voters of each city in which the indebtedness did not originate votes in favor thereof, and the number of persons voting on such proposition constitutes not less than forty percent of the total number of votes cast in such cities in which indebtedness did not originate at the last preceding general election: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That if general obligation bond indebtedness was incurred by action by the city legislative body, a proposition for the assumption of such indebtedness by the other city or cities in which such indebtedness did not originate shall be deemed approved if a majority of the voters of each city in which such indebtedness did not originate votes in favor thereof.

A duly certified copy of such statement of an annexation election shall be filed with the legislative body of each of the cities affected and recorded upon its minutes, and it shall be the duty of the clerk, or other officer performing the duties of clerk, of each of such legislative bodies, to transmit to the secretary of state and the office of financial management a duly certified copy of the record of such statement.

## 35.10.365 - Annexation—Transfer of fire department employees—Rights and benefits.
1. An eligible employee may transfer into the civil service system of the annexing city, code city, or town by filing a written request with the city, code city, or town civil service commission. Upon receipt of the request by the civil service commission, the transfer of employment must be made. The needed employees shall be taken in order of seniority and the remaining employees who transfer as provided in this section and RCW 35.10.360 and 35.10.370 shall head the list for employment in the civil service system in order of their seniority, to the end that they shall be the first to be reemployed in the city, code city, or town fire department when appropriate positions become available: PROVIDED, That employees who are not immediately hired by the city, code city, or town shall be placed on a reemployment list for a period not to exceed thirty-six months unless a longer period is authorized by an agreement reached between the collective bargaining representatives of the employees of the annexing and annexed fire agencies and the annexing and annexed fire agencies.

2. [Empty]

   a. Upon transfer, an employee is entitled to the employee rights, benefits, and privileges to which he or she would have been entitled as an employee of the fire protection district, including rights to:

      i. Compensation at least equal to the level of compensation at the time of transfer, unless the employee's rank and duties have been reduced as a result of the transfer. If the transferring employee is placed in a position with reduced rank and duties, the employee's compensation may be adjusted, but the adjustment may not result in a decrease of greater than fifty percent of the difference between the employee's compensation before the transfer and the compensation level for the position that the employee is transferred to;

      ii. Retirement, vacation, sick leave, and any other accrued benefit;

      iii. Promotion and service time accrual; and

      iv. The length or terms of probationary periods, including no requirement for an additional probationary period if one had been completed before the transfer date.

   b. (a) of this subsection does not apply if upon transfer an agreement for different terms of transfer is reached between the collective bargaining representatives of the transferring employees and the participating fire protection jurisdictions.

3. If upon transfer, the transferring employee receives the rights, benefits, and privileges established under subsection (2)(a)(i) through (iv) of this section, those rights, benefits, and privileges are subject to collective bargaining at the end of the current bargaining period for the jurisdiction to which the employee has transferred.

4. Such bargaining must take into account the years of service the transferring employee accumulated before the transfer and must be treated as if those years of service occurred in the jurisdiction to which the employee has transferred.

## 35.10.400 - Consolidation.
Two or more contiguous cities located in the same or different counties may consolidate into one city by proceedings in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. When cities are separated by water and/or tide or shore lands they shall be deemed contiguous for all the purposes of this chapter and, upon a consolidation of such cities under the provisions of this chapter, any such intervening water and/or tide or shore lands shall become a part of the consolidated city. The consolidated city shall become a noncharter code city operating under Title 35A RCW.

\[ [1985 c 281 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c281.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20281%20§%203); \]

## 35.10.410 - Consolidation—Submission of ballot proposal—Initiation by resolution of legislative body.
The submission of a ballot proposal to the voters of two or more contiguous cities for the consolidation of these contiguous cities may be caused by the adoption of a joint resolution, by a majority vote of each city legislative body, seeking consolidation of such contiguous cities.

## 35.10.470 - Consolidation—Canvass of votes.
The county canvassing board in each county involved shall canvass the returns in each election. The votes cast in each of such cities shall be canvassed separately, and the statement shall show the whole number of votes cast, the number of votes cast in each city for consolidation, and the number of votes cast in each city against such consolidation. If a proposal for assumption or indebtedness was voted upon in a city in which the indebtedness did not originate, the statement shall show the number of votes cast in such a city for assumption of indebtedness and the number of votes cast against assumption of indebtedness. If a question of the form or plan of government was voted upon, the statement shall show the number of votes cast in each city for each of the optional forms or plans of government. If a name for the proposed consolidated city was voted upon, the statement shall show the number of votes cast in each city for each optional name. A certified copy of such statement shall be filed with the legislative body of each of the cities proposed to be consolidated.

If it appears from such statement of canvass that a majority of the votes cast in each of the cities were in favor of consolidation, the consolidation shall be authorized and shall be effective when the newly elected legislative body members assume office, as provided in RCW 35.10.480.

If a question of the form or plan of government was voted upon, that form or plan receiving the greatest combined number of votes shall become the form or plan of government for the consolidated city. If two or three of the forms or plans of government received the same highest number of votes, the form or plan of government shall be chosen by lot between those receiving the same highest number, where the mayor of the largest of the cities proposed to be consolidated draws the lot at a public meeting.

If a proposition to assume indebtedness was submitted to voters of a city in which the indebtedness did not originate, the proposition shall be deemed approved if approved by a majority of at least three-fifths of the voters of the city, and the number of persons voting on the proposition constitutes not less than forty percent of the number of votes cast in the city at the last preceding general election. Approval of the proposition authorizes annual property taxes to be levied on the property within the city in which the indebtedness did not originate that are in excess of regular property taxes. However, if the general indebtedness in question was incurred by action of a city legislative body, a proposition for assuming the indebtedness need only be approved by a simple majority vote of the voters of the city in which such indebtedness did not originate.

If a question of the name of the proposed consolidated city was voted upon, that name receiving the greatest combined number of votes shall become the name of the consolidated city. If two proposed names receive the same number of votes, the name shall be chosen by lot, where the mayor of the largest of the cities proposed to be consolidated draws the lot at a public meeting.

If the joint resolution or the petitions prescribe that councilmembers of the consolidated city shall be elected from wards, then the councilmembers shall be elected from wards under RCW 35A.12.180. Terms shall be established as if the city is initially incorporating.

The newly elected officials shall take office immediately upon their qualification. The effective date of the consolidation shall be when a majority of the newly elected members of the legislative body assume office.

## 35.10.490 - Consolidation—Name of city.
A joint resolution or the petitions may prescribe the name of the proposed consolidated city or may provide that a ballot proposition to determine the name of the proposed consolidated city be submitted to the voters of the cities proposed to be consolidated. If two alternative names are submitted, the name receiving the simple majority vote of the voters voting on the question shall become the name of the consolidated city.
