## 35.82.010 - Finding and declaration of necessity.
It is hereby declared: (1) That there exist in the state insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations and that persons of low income are forced to reside in such insanitary or unsafe accommodations; that within the state there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state and impair economic values; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities; (2) that these areas in the state cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved, through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income (as herein defined) would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise; (3) that the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which insanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern; (4) that it is in the public interest that work on projects for such purposes be commenced as soon as possible in order to relieve unemployment which now (1939) constitutes an emergency; and the necessity in the public interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted, is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

## 35.82.030 - Creation of housing authorities.
In each city (as herein defined) and in each county of the state there is hereby created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the "Housing Authority" of the city or county: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the governing body of the city or the county, as the case may be, by proper resolution shall declare at any time hereafter that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county. The determination as to whether or not there is such need for an authority to function (1) may be made by the governing body on its own motion or (2) shall be made by the governing body upon the filing of a petition signed by twenty-five residents of the city or county, as the case may be, asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county and requesting that the governing body so declare.

The governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is need for a housing authority in the city or county, as the case may be, if it shall find (1) that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such city or county; (2) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such city or county available to persons of low income at rentals they can afford; or (3) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwellings, apartments, mobile home parks, or other living accommodations available for senior citizens. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or insanitary said governing body may take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the sanitary facilities, and the extent to which conditions exist in such buildings which endanger life or property by fire or other causes.

In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority. Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is such need for an authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms (no further detail being necessary) that either or both of the above enumerated conditions exist in the city or county, as the case may be. A copy of such resolution duly certified by the clerk shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 187 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c187.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%20187%20§%202); [1965 c 7 § 35.82.030](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.82.030); [1939 c 23 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1939c23.pdf?cite=1939%20c%2023%20§%204); RRS § 6889-4; \]

## 35.82.040 - Appointment, qualifications, and tenure of commissioners.
Except as provided in RCW 35.82.045, when the governing body of a city adopts a resolution declaring that there is a need for a housing authority, it shall promptly notify the mayor of such adoption. Upon receiving such notice, the mayor shall appoint five persons as commissioners of the authority created for the city. When the governing body of a county adopts a resolution declaring that there is a need for a housing authority, it shall appoint five persons as commissioners of the authority created for the county. The commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one, two, three, four and five years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, but thereafter commissioners shall be appointed for a term of office of five years except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term. No commissioner of an authority may be an officer or employee of the city or county for which the authority is created, unless the commissioner is an employee of a separately elected county official other than the county governing body in a county with a population of less than one hundred seventy-five thousand as of the 1990 federal census, and the total government employment in that county exceeds forty percent of total employment. A commissioner shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified, unless sooner removed according to this chapter. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner. A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his or her services for the authority, in any capacity, but he or she shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his or her duties.

The powers of each authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof in office from time to time. Except as provided in RCW 35.82.045, three commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number. The mayor (or in the case of an authority for a county, the governing body of the county) shall designate which of the commissioners appointed shall be the first chair of the commission and he or she shall serve in the capacity of chair until the expiration of his or her term of office as commissioner. When the office of the chair of the authority becomes vacant, the authority shall select a chair from among its commissioners. An authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice chair, and it may employ a secretary (who shall be executive director), technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. For such legal services as it may require, an authority may call upon the chief law officer of the city or the county or may employ its own counsel and legal staff. An authority may delegate to one or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.

If federal law requires that the membership of the board of commissioners of a local authority contains one member who is directly assisted by the authority, the board may by resolution temporarily or permanently increase its size to six members. The board may determine the length of the term of the position filled by a directly assisted member. A person appointed to such a position may serve in that position only as long as he or she is directly assisted by the authority.

1. After June 11, 1998, the governing body of a city with a population of four hundred thousand or more, that has created a housing authority under RCW 35.82.040, shall adopt a resolution to expand the number of commissioners on the housing authority from five to seven. Upon receiving the notice, the mayor, with approval of the city council, shall appoint additional persons as commissioners of the authority created for the city.

2. In appointing commissioners, the mayor shall consider persons that represent the community, provided that two commissioners shall consist of tenants that reside in a housing project that is owned by the housing authority.

3. After June 11, 1998, all commissioners shall be appointed to serve four-year terms, except that all vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term.

7. The powers of each authority vest in the commissioners of the authority in office from time to time. Four commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number.

8. The mayor, with consent of the city council, shall designate which of the commissioners appointed shall be the first chair of the commission and he or she shall serve in the capacity of chair until the expiration of his or her term of office as commissioner. When the office of the chair of the authority becomes vacant, the authority shall select a chair from among its commissioners. An authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice chair, and the authority may employ a secretary, who shall be executive director, technical experts and such other officers, agents, and employees, permanent and temporary, as the authority requires, and shall determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation.

9. For such legal services as it may require, an authority may call upon the chief law officer of the city or may employ its own counsel and legal staff. An authority may delegate to one or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.

## 35.82.050 - Conflicts of interest for commissioners, employees, and appointees.
1. No commissioner, employee, or appointee to any decision-making body for the housing authority shall own or hold an interest in any contract or property or engage in any business, transaction, or professional or personal activity, that would:

   a. Be, or appear to be, in conflict with the commissioner's, employee's, or appointee's official duties to any decision-making body for the housing authority duties relating to the housing authority served by or subject to the authority of such commissioner, employee, or appointee to any decision-making body for the housing authority;

   b. Secure, or appear to secure, unwarranted privileges or advantages for such commissioner, employee, or appointee to any decision-making body for the housing authority, or others; or

   c. Prejudice, or appear to prejudice, such commissioner's, employee's, or appointee's to any decision-making body for the housing authority independence of judgment in exercise of his or her official duties relating to the housing authority served by or subject to the authority of the commissioner, employee, or appointee to any decision-making body for the housing authority.

2.

## 35.82.340 - Previously incarcerated individuals—Rental policies that are not unduly burdensome encouraged.
The legislature recognizes that stable, habitable, and supportive housing is a critical factor that increases a previously incarcerated individual's access to treatment and services as well as the likelihood of success in the community. Housing authorities are therefore encouraged to formulate rental policies that are not unduly burdensome to previously incarcerated individuals attempting to reenter the community, particularly when the individual's family may already reside in government subsidized housing.
