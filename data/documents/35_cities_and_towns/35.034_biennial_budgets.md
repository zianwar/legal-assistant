## 35.34.010 - Legislative intent.
The legislature hereby recognizes that the development and adoption of a budget by a city or town is a lengthy and intense process designed to provide adequate opportunities for public input and sufficient time for deliberation and enactment by the legislative authority. The legislature also recognizes that there are limited amounts of time available and that time committed for budgetary action reduces opportunities for deliberating other issues. It is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to authorize cities and towns to establish by ordinance a biennial budget and to provide the means for modification of such budget. This chapter and chapter 35A.34 RCW shall be known as the municipal biennial budget act.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%201); \]

In addition, all or any portion of the city's or town's outstanding registered warrants may be funded into bonds in any manner authorized by law.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 20](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2020); \]

## 35.34.180 - Adjustment of wages, hours, and conditions of employment.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 21](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2021); \]

## 35.34.200 - Funds—Limitations on expenditures—Transfers and adjustments.
1. The expenditures as classified and itemized in the final budget shall constitute the city's or town's appropriations for the ensuing fiscal biennium. Unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, and subject to further limitations imposed by ordinance of the city or town, the expenditure of city or town funds or the incurring of current liabilities on behalf of the city or town shall be limited to the following:

   a. The total amount appropriated for each fund in the budget for the current fiscal biennium, without regard to the individual items contained therein, except that this limitation does not apply to wage adjustments authorized by RCW 35.34.180;

   b. The unexpended appropriation balances of a preceding budget which may be carried forward from prior fiscal periods pursuant to RCW 35.34.270;

   c. Funds received from the sale of bonds or warrants which have been duly authorized according to law;

2. Transfers between individual appropriations within any one fund may be made during the current fiscal biennium by order of the city's or town's chief administrative officer subject to such regulations, if any, as may be imposed by the city or town legislative body. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 43.09.210 or of any statute to the contrary, transfers, as authorized in this section, may be made within the same fund regardless of the various offices, departments, or divisions of the city or town which may be affected.

3. The city or town legislative body, upon a finding that it is to the best interests of the city or town to decrease, revoke, or recall all or any portion of the total appropriations provided for any one fund, may, by ordinance, approved by the vote of one more than the majority of all members thereof, stating the facts and findings for doing so, decrease, revoke, or recall all or any portion of an unexpended fund balance, and by said ordinance, or a subsequent ordinance adopted by a like majority, the moneys thus released may be reappropriated for another purpose or purposes, without limitation to department, division, or fund, unless the use of such moneys is otherwise restricted by law, charter, or ordinance.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 23](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2023); \]

## 35.34.210 - Liabilities incurred in excess of budget.
Liabilities incurred by any officer or employee of the city or town in excess of any budget appropriations shall not be a liability of the city or town. The clerk shall issue no warrant and the city or town legislative body or other authorized person shall approve no claim for an expenditure in excess of the total amount appropriated for any individual fund, except upon an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or for emergencies as provided in this chapter.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 24](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2024); \]

## 35.34.220 - Funds received from sales of bonds and warrants—Expenditure program—Federal tax law.
Moneys received from the sale of bonds or warrants must be used for no other purpose than that for which they were issued.

## 35.34.250 - Contingency fund—Creation.
Every city or town may create and maintain a contingency fund to provide moneys with which to meet any municipal expense, the necessity or extent of which could not have been foreseen or reasonably evaluated at the time of adopting the annual budget, or from which to provide moneys for those emergencies described in RCW 35.34.140 and 35.34.150. Such fund may be supported by a budget appropriation from any tax or other revenue source not restricted in use by law, or also may be supported by a transfer from other unexpended or decreased funds made available by ordinance as set forth in RCW 35.34.200. However, the total amount accumulated in such fund at any time shall not exceed the equivalent of thirty-seven and one-half cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation of property within the city or town at such time. Any moneys in the emergency fund at the end of the fiscal biennium shall not lapse except upon reappropriation by the council to another fund in the adoption of a subsequent budget.

## 35.34.270 - Unexpended appropriations.
All appropriations in any current operating fund shall lapse at the end of each fiscal biennium. However, this shall not prevent payments in the following biennium upon uncompleted programs or improvements in progress or on orders subsequently filled or claims subsequently billed for the purchase of material, equipment, and supplies or for personal or contractual services not completed or furnished by the end of the fiscal biennium, all of which have been properly budgeted and contracted for prior to the close of such fiscal biennium, but furnished or completed in due course thereafter.

All appropriations in a special fund authorized by ordinance or by state law to be used only for the purpose or purposes therein specified, including any cumulative reserve funds lawfully established in specific or general terms for any municipal purpose or purposes, or a contingency fund as authorized by RCW 35.34.250, shall not lapse, but shall be carried forward from biennium to biennium until fully expended or the purpose has been accomplished or abandoned, without necessity of reappropriation.

The accounts for budgetary control for each fiscal biennium shall be kept open for twenty days after the close of such fiscal biennium for the purpose of paying and recording claims for indebtedness incurred during such fiscal biennium; any claim presented after the twentieth day following the close of the fiscal biennium shall be paid from appropriations lawfully provided for the ensuing period, including those made available by provisions of this section, and shall be recorded in the accounts for the ensuing fiscal biennium.
