## 35.13A.020 - Assumption authorized—Disposition of properties and rights—Outstanding indebtedness—Management and control.
1. Whenever all of the territory of a district is included within the corporate boundaries of a city, the city legislative body may adopt a resolution or ordinance to assume jurisdiction over all of the district.

2. Upon the assumption, all real and personal property, franchises, rights, assets, taxes levied but not collected for the district for other than indebtedness, water, sewer, and drainage facilities, and all other facilities and equipment of the district shall become the property of the city subject to all financial, statutory, or contractual obligations of the district for the security or performance of which the property may have been pledged. The city, in addition to its other powers, shall have the power to manage, control, maintain, and operate the property, facilities and equipment and to fix and collect service and other charges from owners and occupants of properties so served by the city, subject, however, to any outstanding indebtedness, bonded or otherwise, of the district payable from taxes, assessments, or revenues of any kind or nature and to any other contractual obligations of the district.

3. The city may by resolution or ordinance of its legislative body, assume the obligation of paying such district indebtedness and of levying and of collecting or causing to be collected the district taxes, assessments, and utility rates and charges of any kind or nature to pay and secure the payment of the indebtedness, according to all of the terms, conditions and covenants incident to the indebtedness, and shall assume and perform all other outstanding contractual obligation of the district in accordance with all of their terms, conditions, and covenants. An assumption shall not be deemed to impair the obligation of any indebtedness or other contractual obligation. During the period until the outstanding indebtedness of the district has been discharged, the territory of the district and the owners and occupants of property therein, shall continue to be liable for its and their proportionate share of the indebtedness, including any outstanding assessments levied within any local improvement district or utility local improvement district thereof. The city shall assume the obligation of causing the payment of the district's indebtedness, collecting the district's taxes, assessments, and charges, and observing and performing the other district contractual obligations. The legislative body of the city shall act as the officers of the district for the purpose of certifying the amount of any property tax to be levied and collected therein, and causing service and other charges and assessments to be collected from the property or owners or occupants thereof, enforcing the collection and performing all other acts necessary to ensure performance of the district's contractual obligations in the same manner and by the same means as if the territory of the district had not been included within the boundaries of a city.

When a city assumes the obligation of paying the outstanding indebtedness, and if property taxes or assessments have been levied and service and other charges have accrued for this purpose but have not been collected by the district prior to the assumption, the same when collected shall belong and be paid to the city and be used by the city so far as necessary for payment of the indebtedness of the district existing and unpaid on the date the city assumes the indebtedness. Any funds received by the city which have been collected for the purpose of paying any bonded or other indebtedness of the district, shall be used for the purpose for which they were collected and for no other purpose. Any outstanding indebtedness shall be paid as provided in the terms, conditions, and covenants of the indebtedness. All funds of the district on deposit with the county treasurer at the time of title transfer shall be used by the city solely for the benefit of the assumed utility and shall not be transferred to or used for the benefit of the city's general fund.

## 35.13A.030 - Assumption of control if sixty percent or more of area or valuation within city.
Whenever a portion of a district equal to at least sixty percent of the area or sixty percent of the assessed valuation of the real property lying within such district, is included within the corporate boundaries of a city, the city may assume by ordinance the full and complete management and control of that portion of the entire district not included within another city, whereupon the provisions of RCW 35.13A.020 shall be operative; or the city may proceed directly under the provisions of RCW 35.13A.050.

In the event a city proceeds under this section, the district may elect upon a favorable vote of a majority of all voters within the district voting upon such propositions to require the city to assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the district's property, facilities and equipment throughout the entire district and to pay the city a charge for such operation and maintenance which is reasonable under all of the circumstances.

A city acquiring property, facilities and equipment under the provisions of this section shall acquire such property, facilities and equipment, and fix and collect service and other charges from owners and occupants of properties served by the city, subject, to any contractual obligations of the district which relate to the property, facilities, or equipment so acquired by the city or which are secured by taxes, assessments or revenues from the territory of the district included within the city. In such cases, the property included within the city and the owners and occupants thereof shall continue to be liable for payment of its and their proportionate share of any outstanding district indebtedness. The district and its officers shall continue to levy taxes and assessments on and to collect service and other charges from such property, or owners or occupants thereof, to enforce such collections, and to perform all other acts necessary to insure performance of the district's contractual obligations in the same manner and by the same means as if the territory of the district had not been included within the boundaries of a city.

## 35.13A.060 - District in more than one city—Assumption of responsibilities—Duties of cities.
Whenever more than one city, in whole or in part, is included within a district, the city which has within its boundaries sixty percent or more of the area of the assessed valuation of the district (in this section referred to as the "principal city") may, with the approval of any other city containing part of such district, assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of the district's property, facilities and equipment within such other city and make and enforce such charges for operation, maintenance and retirement of indebtedness as may be reasonable under all the circumstances.

Any other city having less than sixty percent in area or assessed valuation of such district, within its boundaries may install facilities and create local improvement districts or otherwise finance the cost of installation of such facilities and if such facilities have been installed in accordance with reasonable standards fixed by the principal city, such other city may connect such facilities to the utility system of such district operated by the principal city upon providing for payment by the owners or occupants of properties served thereby, of such charges established by the principal city as may be reasonable under the circumstances.

1. Except as provided otherwise by subsection (4) of this section, a resolution or ordinance adopted by the legislative body of a city to assume jurisdiction of all or part of a water-sewer district under this chapter is subject to a referendum. Any referendum petition to repeal the assumption resolution or ordinance must be filed with the county auditor within ten days of passage of the resolution or ordinance. Within ten days of the filing of a petition, the county auditor must confer with the petitioner concerning the form and style of the petition and issue a petition identification number. The ballot title must be prepared by the applicable city attorney in accordance with this section and RCW 29A.36.071, and the question posed to the voters must be written so that an affirmative answer to the question and a majority affirmative vote on the measure results in approval of the proposed assumption, and a negative answer to the question and a majority negative vote on the measure results in the assumption being barred. The petitioner must be notified of the identification number and ballot title within this ten-day period. After this notification, the petitioner has forty-five days in which to secure on petition forms the signatures of at least ten percent of the number of voters residing in the part of the water-sewer district subject to the assumption resolution or ordinance who voted in the most recent general election, and file the signed petitions with the county auditor. Each petition form must contain the ballot title and full text of the measure to be referred. The county auditor must verify the sufficiency of the signatures on the petitions.

2. If sufficient valid signatures on the petitions are properly submitted, the county auditor must submit the referendum measure to the registered voters residing in the part of the water-sewer district subject to the assumption resolution or ordinance in a general or special election no later than one hundred twenty days after the signed petition has been filed with the county auditor. Elections must be conducted in accordance with general election law, and the cost of the election must be borne by the city seeking approval to assume jurisdiction of all or part of the water-sewer district.

3. When a referendum petition is filed with the county auditor, the assumption resolution or ordinance sought to be referred to the voters, and any proceedings before a boundary review board under chapter 36.93 RCW, are suspended from taking effect. Such suspension terminates when: (a) There is a final determination of insufficiency or untimeliness of the referendum petition; or (b) the assumption resolution or ordinance so referred is approved by the voters at a referendum election.

4. If a city legislative authority assumes jurisdiction of all or part of a water-sewer district through a contract with a water-sewer district, or through an interlocal agreement with a water-sewer district under chapter 39.34 RCW, the provisions of this section do not apply.
