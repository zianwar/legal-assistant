Notwithstanding the methods of assessment provided in RCW 35.44.030, 35.44.040 and 35.44.045, the city or town may use any other method or combination of methods to compute assessments which may be deemed to more fairly reflect the special benefits to the properties being assessed. The failure of the council to specifically recite in its ordinance ordering the improvement and creating the local improvement district that it will not use the zone and termini method of assessment shall not invalidate the use of any other method or methods of assessment.

If a hearing is held before such a committee or officer it shall not be necessary to hold a hearing on the assessment roll before such legislative authority. A local ordinance shall provide for an appeal by any person protesting his or her assessment to the legislative authority of a decision made by such officer.
