Whenever the legislative authority of any city or town has provided pursuant to law for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, purchase, condemnation and purchase, addition to, repair, or renewal of the whole or any portion of a:

1. System for providing the city or town and the inhabitants thereof with water, which system includes as a whole or as a part thereof water mains, hydrants or appurtenances which are authorized subjects for local improvements under RCW 35.43.040(13) or other law; or a

2. System for providing the city or town with sewerage and storm or surface water disposal, which system includes as a whole or as a part thereof drains, sewers or sewer appurtenances which are authorized subjects for local improvements under RCW 35.43.040(7) or other law; or

3. Off-street parking facilities; and

Has further provided in accordance with any applicable provisions of the Constitution or statutory authority for the issuance and sale of revenue bonds to pay the cost of all or a portion of any such system, such legislative authority shall have the authority to establish utility local improvement districts, and to levy special assessments on all property specially benefited by any such local improvement to pay in whole or in part the damages or costs of any local improvements so provided for.

The initiation and formation of such utility local improvement districts and the levying, collection and enforcement of assessments shall be in the manner and subject to the same procedures and limitations as are now or hereafter provided by law for the initiation and formation of local improvement districts in cities and towns and the levying, collection and enforcement of assessments pursuant thereto.

It must be specified in any petition or resolution initiating the formation of such a utility local improvement district in a city or town and in the ordinance ordered pursuant thereto, that the assessments shall be for the sole purpose of payment into such revenue bond fund as may be specified by the legislative authority for the payment of revenue bonds issued to defray the cost of such system or facilities or any portion thereof as provided for in this section.

Assessments in any such utility local improvement district may be made on the basis of special benefits up to but not in excess of the total cost of the local improvements portion of any system or facilities payable by issuance of revenue bonds. No warrants or bonds shall be issued in any such utility local improvement district, but the collection of interest and principal on all assessments in such utility local improvement district, when collected, shall be paid into any such revenue bond fund.

When in the petition or resolution for establishment of a local improvement district and in the ordinance ordered pursuant thereto, it is specified or provided that the assessments shall be for the sole purpose of payment into a revenue bond fund for the payment of revenue bonds, then the local improvement district shall be designated a "utility local improvement district".

The provisions of chapters 35.45, 35.47 and 35.48 RCW shall have no application to utility local improvement districts created under authority of this section.

\[ [1969 ex.s. c 258 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969ex1c258.pdf?cite=1969%20ex.s.%20c%20258%20§%202); [1967 c 52 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c52.pdf?cite=1967%20c%2052%20§%201); \]

## 35.43.043 - Conversion of local improvement district into utility local improvement district.
The legislative authority of any city or town may by ordinance convert any then existing local improvement district into a utility local improvement district at any time prior to the adoption of an ordinance approving and confirming the final assessment roll of such local improvement district. The ordinance so converting the local improvement district shall provide for the payment of the special assessments levied in that district into the special fund established or to be established for the payment of revenue bonds issued to defray the cost of the local improvement in that district.

\[ [1967 c 52 § 28](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c52.pdf?cite=1967%20c%2052%20§%2028); \]

## 35.43.045 - Open canals or ditches—Safeguards.
Every city or town shall have the right of entry upon all irrigation, drainage, or flood control canal or ditch rights-of-way within its limits for all purposes necessary to safeguard the public from the hazards of such open canals or ditches, and the right to cause to be constructed, installed, and maintained upon or adjacent to such rights-of-way safeguards as provided in RCW 35.43.040: PROVIDED, That such safeguards must not unreasonably interfere with maintenance of the canal or ditch or with the operation thereof. The city or town, at its option, notwithstanding any laws to the contrary, may require the irrigation, drainage, flood control, or other district, agency, person, corporation, or association maintaining the canal or ditch to supervise the installation and construction of such safeguards, or to maintain the same. If such option is exercised reimbursement must be made by the city or town for all actual costs thereof.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.43.045](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.43.045); [1959 c 75 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1959c75.pdf?cite=1959%20c%2075%20§%202); \]

## 35.43.050 - Authority—Noncontinuous improvements.
When the legislative body of any city or town finds that all of the property within a local improvement district or utility local improvement district will be benefited by the improvements as a whole, a local improvement district or utility local improvement district may include adjoining, vicinal, or neighboring streets, avenues, and alleys or other improvements even though the improvements thus made are not connected or continuous. The assessment rates may be ascertained on the basis of the special benefit of the improvements as a whole to the properties within the entire local improvement district or utility local improvement district, or on the basis of the benefit of each unit of the improvements to the properties specially benefited by that unit, or the assessment rates may be ascertained by a combination of the two bases. Where no finding is made by the legislative body as to the benefit of the improvements as a whole to all of the property within a local improvement district or utility local improvement district, the cost and expense of each continuous unit of the improvements shall be ascertained separately, as near as may be, and the assessment rates shall be computed on the basis of the cost and expense of each unit. In the event of the initiation of a local improvement district authorized by this section or a utility local improvement district authorized by this section, the legislative body may, in its discretion, eliminate from the district any unit of the improvement which is not connected or continuous and may proceed with the balance of the improvement within the local improvement district or utility local improvement district, as fully and completely as though the eliminated unit had not been included within the improvement district, without the giving of any notices to the property owners remaining within the district, other than such notices as are required by the provisions of this chapter to be given subsequent to such elimination.

Supp. 1947 § 9365, part; \]

## 35.43.060 - Consolidated cities—Procedure.

## 35.43.070 - Ordinance—Action on petition or resolution.
A local improvement may be ordered only by an ordinance of the city or town council, pursuant to either a resolution or petition therefor. The ordinance must receive the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the council.

The contract may provide for reimbursement to the owner of such costs from the proceeds of bonds issued by the district after formation of a district under this chapter, from assessments paid to the district as appropriate, or by a credit in the amount of such costs against future assessments assessed against such property under the district. Such reimbursement shall be made to the owner of the property at the time of reimbursement. The contract shall also provide that such costs shall not be reimbursed to the owner if a district to construct the specified improvements (as the project may be amended) is not formed within six years of the date of the contract.

The terms for reimbursement shall require the owners of underdeveloped properties on whose behalf payments of assessments have been made to reimburse all such assessment payments to the party who made them when those properties are developed or redeveloped, together with interest at a rate specified in the ordinance. The ordinance may provide that reimbursement shall be made on a one-time, lump sum basis, or may provide that reimbursement shall be made over a period not to exceed five years. The ordinance may provide that reimbursement shall be made no later than the time of dissolution of the district, or may provide that no reimbursement is due if the underdeveloped properties are not developed or redeveloped before the dissolution of the district. Reimbursement amounts due from underdeveloped properties under this section are liens upon the underdeveloped properties in the same manner and with like effect as assessments made under this chapter. For the purposes of this section, "underdeveloped properties" may include those properties that, in the discretion of the legislative body of the city or town, (1) are undeveloped or are not developed to their highest and best use, and (2) are likely to be developed or redeveloped before the dissolution of the district.

## 35.43.190 - Work—By contract or by city or public corporation.
All local improvements, the funds for the making of which are derived in whole or in part from assessments upon property specially benefited shall be made by contract on competitive bids whenever the estimated cost of such improvement including the cost of materials, supplies, labor, and equipment will exceed the sum of five thousand dollars. The city, town, or public corporation may reject any and all bids. The city, town, or public corporation itself may make the local improvements if all the bids received exceed by ten percent preliminary cost estimates prepared by an independent consulting engineer or registered professional engineer retained for that purpose by the city, town, or public corporation.
