If such remaining amount to be paid to purchase such leased property will result in a total indebtedness in excess of one and one-half percent of the taxable property of such city or town, a proposition in regard to whether or not to purchase the property shall be submitted to the voters for approval or rejection in the same manner that bond issues for capital purposes are submitted to the voters.
