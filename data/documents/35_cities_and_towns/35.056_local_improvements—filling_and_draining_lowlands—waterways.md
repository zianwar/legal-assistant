## 35.56.010 - Authority—First and second-class cities.
If the city council or commission of any city of the first or second class in this state deems it necessary or expedient on account of the public health, sanitation, the general welfare, or other cause, to fill or raise the grade or elevation of any marshlands, swamplands, tidelands or lands commonly known as tideflats, or any other lands situated within the limits of such city and to clear and prepare said lands for such filling it may do so by proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

For the purpose of filling and raising the grade or elevation of such lands and to secure material therefor and to provide for the proper drainage thereof after such fill has been effected, the city council or commission may acquire rights-of-way (and where necessary or desirable, may vacate, use and appropriate streets and alleys for such purposes) and lay out, build, construct and maintain over and across such lowlands, canals or artificial waterways of at least sufficient width, depth and length to provide and afford the quantity of earth, dirt and material required to complete such fill, and with the earth, dirt and material removed in digging and constructing such canals and waterways, fill and raise the grade or elevation of such marshlands, swamplands, tidelands or tideflats; and such canals or waterways shall be constructed of such width and depth (provided that all the earth, dirt and other suitable material removed in constructing the same shall be used to fill the lowlands as herein provided) as will make them available, convenient and suitable to provide water frontage for landings, wharves and other conveniences of navigation and commerce for the use and benefit of the city and the public. If canals or waterways are to be constructed as herein provided, such city may construct and maintain the necessary bridges over and across the same; such canals or waterways shall be forever under the control of such city and shall be and become public thoroughfares and waterways for the use and benefit of commerce, shipping, the city and the public generally.

The expense of making such improvement and in doing, accomplishing and effecting all the work provided for in this chapter including the cost of making compensation for property taken or damaged, and all other cost and expense incidental to such improvement, shall be assessed to the property benefited, except such amount of such expense as the city council or commission, in its discretion, may direct to be paid out of the current or general expense fund.

## 35.56.020 - Alternative methods of financing.
If the city council or commission desires to make any improvement authorized by the provisions of this chapter it shall provide therefor by ordinance and unless the ordinance provides that the improvement shall be paid for wholly or in part by special assessment upon the property benefited, compensation therefor shall be made from any general or special funds of the city applicable thereto. If the ordinance provides that the improvement shall be paid for wholly or in part by special assessments upon property benefited, the proceedings for the making of such special assessment shall be as hereafter provided.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.56.020](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.56.020); 1913 c 16 § 2, part; RRS § 9450, part; \]

## 35.56.030 - Boundaries—Excepted property.
Such ordinance shall specify the boundaries of the proposed improvement district and shall describe the lands which it is proposed to assess for said improvement, and shall provide for the filling of such lowlands and shall outline the general scheme or plan of such fill. If any parcel of land within the boundaries of such proposed improvement district prior to the initiation of the improvement has been wholly filled to the proposed grade or elevation of the proposed fill, such parcel of land may be excluded from the lands to be assessed when in the opinion of the city council or commission justice and equity require its exclusion. The boundaries of any improvement district may be altered so as to exclude land therefrom at any time up to the levying of the assessment but such changing of the boundaries shall be by ordinance.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.56.030](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.56.030); 1913 c 16 § 2, part; RRS § 9450, part; \]

## 35.56.040 - Conditions precedent to passage of ordinance—Protests.
Upon the introduction of an ordinance providing for such fill, if the city council or commission desires to proceed, it shall fix a time, not less than ten days, in which protests against said fill may be filed in the office of the city clerk. Thereupon it shall be the duty of the clerk of said city to publish in the official newspaper of said city in at least two consecutive issues thereof before the time fixed for the filing of protests, a notice of the time fixed for the filing of protests together with a copy of the proposed ordinance as introduced.

Protests against the proposed fill to be effective must be filed by the owners of more than half of the area of land situated within the proposed filling district exclusive of streets, alleys and public places on or before the date fixed for such filing. If an effective protest is filed the council shall not proceed further unless two-thirds of the members of the city council vote to proceed with the work; if the city is operating under a commission form of government composed of three commissioners, the commission shall not proceed further except by a unanimous affirmative vote of all the members thereof, if the commission is composed of five members, at least four affirmative votes thereof shall be necessary before proceeding.

If no effective protest is filed or if an effective protest is filed and two-thirds of the councilmembers vote to proceed with the work or in cases where cities are operating under the commission form of government, the commissioners vote unanimously or four out of five commissioners vote to proceed with the work, the city council or commission shall at such meeting or in a succeeding meeting proceed to pass the proposed ordinance for the work, with such amendments and modifications as to the said city council or commission of said city may seem proper. The local improvement district shall be called "filling district No. . . . ."

\[ [2009 c 549 § 2094](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5038.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20549%20§%202094); [1965 c 7 § 35.56.040](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.56.040); 1913 c 16 § 2, part; RRS § 9450, part; \]

## 35.56.050 - Damages—Eminent domain.
If an ordinance is passed as in this chapter provided, and it appears that in making of the improvements so authorized, private property will be taken or damaged thereby within or without the city, the city shall file a petition in the superior court of the county in which such city is situated, in the name of the city, praying that just compensation be made for the property to be taken or damaged for the improvement specified in the ordinance and conduct proceedings in eminent domain in accordance with the statutes relating to cities for the ascertainment of the compensation to be made for the taking and damaging of property, except insofar as the same may be inconsistent with this chapter.

The filling of unimproved and uncultivated lowlands of the character mentioned in RCW 35.56.010 shall not be considered as a damaging or taking of such lands. The damage, if any, done to cultivated lands or growing crops thereon, or to buildings and other improvements situated within the district proposed to be filled shall be ascertained and determined in the manner above provided; but no damage shall be awarded to any property owner for buildings or improvements placed upon lands included within said district after the publication of the ordinance defining the boundaries of the proposed improvement district: PROVIDED, That the city shall, after the passage of such ordinance, proceed with said improvement with due diligence.

If the improvement is to be made at the expense of the property benefited, no account shall be taken of benefits by the jury or court in assessing the amount of compensation to be made to the owner of any property within such district, but such compensation shall be assessed without regard to benefits to the end that said property for which damages may be so awarded, may be assessed the same as other property within the district for its just share and proportion of the expense of making said improvement, and the fact that compensation has been awarded for the damaging or taking of any parcel of land shall not preclude the assessment of such parcel of land for its just proportion of said improvement.

\[ [1965 c 7 § 35.56.050](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965c7.pdf?cite=1965%20c%207%20§%2035.56.050); [1913 c 16 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1913c16.pdf?cite=1913%20c%2016%20§%203); RRS § 9451.   1929 c 63 § 4; [1913 c 16 § 21](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1913c16.pdf?cite=1913%20c%2016%20§%2021); RRS § 9469; \]

## 35.56.060 - Estimates—Plans and specifications.

## 35.56.070 - Assessment roll—Items—Assessment units—Installments.
When such plans and specifications shall have been prepared and the estimate of the cost and expense of making the improvement has been adopted by the council or commission and when an estimate has been made of the compensation to be paid for property damaged or taken, either before or after the compensation has been ascertained in the eminent domain proceedings, the city council or commission shall cause an assessment roll to be prepared containing a list of all the property within the improvement district which it is proposed to assess for the improvements together with the names of the owners, if known, and if unknown, the property shall be assessed to an unknown owner, and opposite each description shall be set the amount assessed to such description.

When so ordered by the city council or commission, the entire amount of compensation paid or to be paid for property damaged or taken, including all of the costs and expenses incidental to the condemnation proceedings together with the entire cost and expense of making the improvement may be assessed against the property within the district subject to assessment, but the city council or commission may order any portion of the costs paid out of the current or general expense fund of the city. The assessments shall be made according to and in proportion to surface area, one square foot of surface to be the unit of assessment: PROVIDED, That where any parcel of land was wholly or partially filled by the owner prior to the initiation of the improvement an equitable deduction for such filling or partial filling may be allowed.

The cost and expense incidental to the filling of the streets, alleys and public places within said assessment district shall be borne by the private property within such district subject to assessment when so ordered by the city council or commission. When the assessments are payable in installments, the assessment roll when equalized shall show the number of installments and the amounts thereof.

The contract for the making of the improvement may be let either before or after the making up of the equalization of the assessment roll, and warrants or bonds may be issued against the local improvement district fund either before or after the equalization of the roll as in the judgment of the council or commission may best subserve the public interest.

If after the assessment roll is made up and equalized, based in whole or in part upon an estimate of the cost of the improvement, and it is found that the estimate was too high, the excess shall be rebated pro rata to the property owners on the assessment roll, the rebates to be deducted from the last installment, or installments, when the assessment is upon the installment plan.

If it is found that the estimated cost was too low and that the actual bona fide cost of the improvement is greater than the estimate, the city council or commission after due notice and a hearing, as in case of the original equalization of the roll, may add the required additional amount to the assessment roll to be apportioned among the several parcels of property upon the same rules and principles as if it had been originally included except that the additional amount shall be added to the last installment of an assessment if assessments are payable upon the installment plan. The same notice shall be required for adding to the assessment roll in this manner as is required for the original equalization of the roll, and the property owner shall have the right of appeal.
