## 74.62.005 - Findings—Intent—2011 1st sp.s. c 36.
1. The legislature finds that:

   a. Persons who have a long-term disability and apply for federal supplemental security income benefits should receive assistance while their application for federal benefits is pending, with repayment from the federal government of state-funded income assistance paid through the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program;

   b. Persons who are incapacitated from gainful employment for an extended period, but who may not meet the level of severity of a long-term disability, are at increased risk of homelessness; and

   c. Persons who are homeless and suffering from significant medical impairments, mental illness, or chemical dependency face substantial barriers to successful participation in, and completion of, needed medical or behavioral health treatment services. Stable housing increases the likelihood of compliance with and completion of treatment.

2. Through chapter 36, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess., the legislature intends to:

   a. Terminate all components of the disability lifeline program created in 2010 and codified in *RCW 74.04.005 and create new programs: (i) To provide financial grants through the aged, blind, and [or] disabled assistance program and the pregnant women assistance program; and (ii) to provide services through the essential needs and housing support program; and

   b. Increase opportunities to utilize limited public funding, combined with private charitable and volunteer efforts to serve persons who are recipients of the benefits provided by the new programs created under chapter 36, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess.

      ii. Meet the eligibility requirements of subsection (3) of this section; and

      iii. Are aged, blind, or disabled. For purposes of determining eligibility for assistance for the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program, the following definitions apply:

           A.  "Aged" means age sixty-five or older.

               II. A determination that an individual is eligible to receive optional categorically needy medicaid as a disabled person under the federal regulations at 42 C.F.R. Parts 435, Secs. 201(a)(3) and 210.

      ii. Persons for whom there has been a final determination of ineligibility based on age, blindness, or disability for federal supplemental security income benefits.

The monetary value of any aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefit that is subsequently duplicated by the person's receipt of supplemental security income for the same period shall be considered a debt due the state and shall by operation of law be subject to recovery through all available legal remedies.

2. The pregnant women assistance program shall provide financial grants to persons who:

   a. Are not eligible to receive federal aid assistance other than basic food benefits or medical assistance; and

   b.

   e. Not have refused or failed to cooperate in obtaining federal aid assistance, without good cause.

4. Referrals for essential needs and housing support under RCW 43.185C.220 shall be provided to persons found eligible under RCW 74.04.805.
