## 74.60.005 - Purpose—Findings—Intent. (Expires July 1, 2025.)
1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a safety net assessment on certain Washington hospitals, which will be used solely to augment funding from all other sources and thereby support additional payments to hospitals for medicaid services as specified in this chapter.

2. The legislature finds that federal health care reform will result in an expansion of medicaid enrollment in this state and an increase in federal financial participation.

3. In adopting this chapter, it is the intent of the legislature:

   a. To impose a hospital safety net assessment to be used solely for the purposes specified in this chapter;

   b. To generate approximately one billion dollars per state fiscal biennium in new state and federal funds by disbursing all of that amount to pay for medicaid hospital services and grants to certified public expenditure and critical access hospitals, except costs of administration as specified in this chapter, in the form of additional payments to hospitals and managed care plans, which may not be a substitute for payments from other sources, but which include quality improvement incentive payments under RCW 74.09.611;

   c. To generate two hundred ninety-two million dollars per biennium during the 2021-2023 and 2023-2025 biennia in new funds to be used in lieu of state general fund payments for medicaid hospital services;

   d. That the total amount assessed not exceed the amount needed, in combination with all other available funds, to support the payments authorized by this chapter;

   e. To condition the assessment on receiving federal approval for receipt of additional federal financial participation and on continuation of other funding sufficient to maintain aggregate payment levels to hospitals for inpatient and outpatient services covered by medicaid, including fee-for-service and managed care, at least at the rates the state paid for those services on July 1, 2015, as adjusted for current enrollment and utilization; and

   f. For each of the two biennia starting with fiscal year 2022 to generate:

      i. Four million dollars for new integrated evidence-based psychiatry residency program slots that did not receive state funding prior to 2016 at the integrated psychiatry residency program at the University of Washington; and

      ii. Eight million two hundred thousand dollars for family medicine residency program slots that did not receive state funding prior to 2016, as directed through the family medicine residency network at the University of Washington, for slots where residents are employed by hospitals.

## 74.60.020 - Hospital safety net assessment fund. (Expires July 1, 2025.)
1. A dedicated fund is hereby established within the state treasury to be known as the hospital safety net assessment fund. The purpose and use of the fund shall be to receive and disburse funds, together with accrued interest, in accordance with this chapter. Moneys in the fund, including interest earned, shall not be used or disbursed for any purposes other than those specified in this chapter. Any amounts expended from the fund that are later recouped by the authority on audit or otherwise shall be returned to the fund.

   a. Any unexpended balance in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall carry over into the following fiscal year or that fiscal year and the following fiscal year and shall be applied to reduce the amount of the assessment under RCW 74.60.050(1)(c).

   b. Any amounts remaining in the fund after July 1, 2025, shall be refunded to hospitals, pro rata according to the amount paid by the hospital since July 1, 2013, subject to the limitations of federal law.

2. All assessments, interest, and penalties collected by the authority under RCW 74.60.030 and 74.60.050 shall be deposited into the fund.

3. Disbursements from the fund are conditioned upon appropriation and the continued availability of other funds sufficient to maintain aggregate payment levels to hospitals for inpatient and outpatient services covered by medicaid, including fee-for-service and managed care, at least at the levels the state paid for those services on July 1, 2015, as adjusted for current enrollment and utilization.

4. Disbursements from the fund may be made only:

   a. To make payments to hospitals and managed care plans as specified in this chapter;

In such a case, the authority may require hospitals receiving excess payments to refund the payments in question to the fund. The state in turn shall return funds to the federal government in the same proportion as the original financing. If a hospital is unable to refund payments, the state shall develop either a payment plan, or deduct moneys from future medicaid payments, or both;

   f. To pay an amount sufficient, when combined with the maximum available amount of federal funds necessary to provide a one percent increase in medicaid hospital inpatient rates to hospitals eligible for quality improvement incentives under RCW 74.09.611.

## 74.60.050 - Notices of assessment—Administration and collection. (Expires July 1, 2025.)
1. The authority, in cooperation with the office of financial management, shall develop rules for determining the amount to be assessed to individual hospitals, notifying individual hospitals of the assessed amount, and collecting the amounts due. Such rule making shall specifically include provision for:

   a. Transmittal of notices of assessment by the authority to each hospital informing the hospital of its nonmedicare hospital inpatient days and the assessment amount due and payable;

   b. Interest on delinquent assessments at the rate specified in RCW 82.32.050; and

   c. Adjustment of the assessment amounts in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

2. For any hospital failing to make an assessment payment within ninety days of its due date, the authority may offset an amount from payments scheduled to be made by the authority to the hospital, reflecting the assessment payments owed by the hospital plus any interest. The authority shall deposit these offset funds into the dedicated hospital safety net assessment fund.

3. For each state fiscal year, the assessment amounts established under RCW 74.60.030 must be adjusted as follows:

   a. If sufficient other funds, including federal funds, are available to make the payments required under this chapter and fund the state portion of the quality incentive payments under RCW 74.09.611 and 74.60.020(4)(f) without utilizing the full assessment under RCW 74.60.030, the authority shall reduce the amount of the assessment to the minimum levels necessary to support those payments;

   b. If the total amount of inpatient and outpatient supplemental payments under RCW 74.60.120 is in excess of the upper payment limits and the entire excess amount cannot be disbursed by additional payments to managed care organizations under RCW 74.60.130, the authority shall proportionately reduce future assessments on prospective payment hospitals to the level necessary to generate additional payments to hospitals that are consistent with the upper payment limit plus the maximum permissible amount of additional payments to managed care organizations under RCW 74.60.130;

   c. If the amount of payments to managed care organizations under RCW 74.60.130 cannot be distributed because of failure to meet federal actuarial soundness or utilization requirements or other federal requirements, the authority shall apply the amount that cannot be distributed to reduce future assessments to the level necessary to generate additional payments to managed care organizations that are consistent with federal actuarial soundness or utilization requirements or other federal requirements;

   d. If required in order to obtain federal matching funds, the maximum number of nonmedicare inpatient days at the higher rate provided under RCW 74.60.030(1)(b)(i) may be adjusted in order to comply with federal requirements;

   e. If the number of nonmedicare inpatient days applied to the rates provided in RCW 74.60.030 will not produce sufficient funds to support the payments required under this chapter and the state portion of the quality incentive payments under RCW 74.09.611 and 74.60.020(4)(f), the assessment rates provided in RCW 74.60.030 may be increased proportionately by category of hospital to amounts no greater than necessary in order to produce the required level of funds needed to make the payments specified in this chapter and the state portion of the quality incentive payments under RCW 74.09.611 and 74.60.020(4)(f); and

   f. Any actual or estimated surplus remaining in the fund at the end of the fiscal year must be applied to reduce the assessment amount for the subsequent fiscal year or that fiscal year and the following fiscal years prior to and including fiscal year 2023.

## 74.60.160 - Contracting with health care authority. (Expires July 1, 2025.)
1. The legislature intends to provide the hospitals with an opportunity to contract with the authority each fiscal biennium to protect the hospitals from future legislative action during the biennium that could result in hospitals receiving less from supplemental payments, increased managed care payments, disproportionate share hospital payments, or access payments than the hospitals expected to receive in return for the assessment based on the biennial appropriations and assessment legislation.

2. Each odd-numbered year after enactment of the biennial omnibus operating appropriations act, the authority shall extend the existing contract for the period of the fiscal biennium beginning July 1st with a hospital that is required to pay the assessment under this chapter or shall offer to enter into a contract with any hospital subject to this chapter that has not previously been a party to a contract or whose contract has expired. The contract must include the following terms:

   a. The authority must agree not to do any of the following:

      i. Increase the assessment from the level set by the authority pursuant to this chapter on the first day of the contract period for reasons other than those allowed under *RCW 74.60.050(2)(e);

      ii. Reduce aggregate payment levels to hospitals for inpatient and outpatient services covered by medicaid, including fee-for-service and managed care, adjusting for changes in enrollment and utilization, from the levels the state paid for those services on the first day of the contract period;

      iii. For critical access hospitals only, reduce the levels of disproportionate share hospital payments under RCW 74.60.110 or access payments under RCW 74.60.100 for all critical access hospitals below the levels specified in those sections on the first day of the contract period;

      iv. For prospective payment system, psychiatric, and rehabilitation hospitals only, reduce the levels of supplemental payments under RCW 74.60.120 for all prospective payment system hospitals below the levels specified in that section on the first day of the contract period unless the supplemental payments are reduced under RCW 74.60.120(2);

      v. For prospective payment system, psychiatric, and rehabilitation hospitals only, reduce the increased capitation payments to managed care organizations under RCW 74.60.130 below the levels specified in that section on the first day of the contract period unless the managed care payments are reduced under RCW 74.60.130(3); or

      vi. Except as specified in this chapter, use assessment revenues for any other purpose than to secure federal medicaid matching funds to support payments to hospitals for medicaid services; and

   b. As long as payment levels are maintained as required under this chapter, the hospital must agree not to challenge the authority's reduction of hospital reimbursement rates to July 1, 2009, levels, which results from the elimination of assessment supported rate restorations and increases, under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396a(a)(30)(a) either through administrative appeals or in court during the period of the contract.

3. If a court finds that the authority has breached an agreement with a hospital under subsection (2)(a) of this section, the authority:

   a. Must immediately refund any assessment payments made subsequent to the breach by that hospital upon receipt; and

   b. May discontinue supplemental payments, increased managed care payments, disproportionate share hospital payments, and access payments made subsequent to the breach for the hospital that are required under this chapter.

4. The remedies provided in this section are not exclusive of any other remedies and rights that may be available to the hospital whether provided in this chapter or otherwise in law, equity, or statute.

## 74.60.170 - Estimated hospital net financial benefit determined by the authority—Formula—Modification. (Expires July 1, 2025.)
1. The estimated hospital net financial benefit under this chapter shall be determined by the authority by summing the following anticipated hospital payments, including all applicable federal matching funds, specified in RCW 74.60.090 for grants to certified public expenditure hospitals, RCW 74.60.100 for payments to critical access hospitals, RCW 74.60.110 for payments to small rural disproportionate share hospitals, RCW 74.60.120 for direct supplemental payments to hospitals, RCW 74.60.130 for managed care capitation payments, RCW 74.60.020(4)(f) for quality improvement incentives, minus the total assessments paid by all hospitals under RCW 74.60.030 for hospital assessments, and minus any taxes paid on RCW 74.60.130 for managed care payments.

2. If, for any reason including reduction or elimination of federal matching funds, the estimated hospital net financial benefit falls below one hundred thirty million dollars in any state fiscal year, the office of financial management shall direct the authority to modify the assessment rates provided for in RCW 74.60.030, and the office of financial management is authorized to direct the authority to adjust the amounts disbursed from the fund, including disbursements for payments under RCW 74.60.020(4)(f) and payments to hospitals under RCW 74.60.090 through 74.60.130 and 74.60.020(4)(g), such that the estimated hospital net financial benefit is equal to the amount disbursed from the fund for use in lieu of state general fund payments. Each category of adjusted payments to hospitals under RCW 74.60.090 through 74.60.130 and payments under RCW 74.60.020(4)(g) must bear the same relationship to the total of such adjusted payments as originally provided in this chapter.
