## 74.13A.005 - Adoption support—State policy enunciated.
It is the policy of this state to enable the secretary to charge fees for certain services to adoptive parents who are able to pay for such services.

It is, however, also the policy of this state that the secretary of the department shall be liberal in waiving, reducing, or deferring payment of any such fee to the end that adoptions shall be encouraged in cases where prospective adoptive parents lack means.

It is the policy of this state to encourage, within the limits of available funds, the adoption of certain hard to place children in order to make it possible for children living in, or likely to be placed in, foster homes or institutions to benefit from the stability and security of permanent homes in which such children can receive continuous parental care, guidance, protection, and love and to reduce the number of such children who must be placed or remain in foster homes or institutions until they become adults.

It is also the policy of this state to try, by means of the program of adoption support authorized in RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, to reduce the total cost to the state of foster home and institutional care.

\[ [2018 c 58 § 73](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%2058%20§%2073); [1985 c 7 § 133](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c7.pdf?cite=1985%20c%207%20§%20133); [1971 ex.s. c 63 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c63.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2063%20§%201); \]

## 74.13A.007 - Adoption support expenditures—Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that the current state adoption support policy to encourage, within available funds, the adoption of certain hard to place children , has expedited permanency for children who are unable to reunify with their family and has resulted in savings otherwise spent on foster care.

The legislature also finds that current economic conditions have reduced state funds available for many critical programs. The legislature further finds that adoption support expenditures continue to increase. Given these realities, the legislature finds there is a need to control adoption support costs without adversely impacting permanency for state dependent children. 

The legislature acknowledges that the best way to reduce adoption support and foster care expenditures is to safely prevent children from entering the foster care system. However, the legislature also finds that the recent prospective reduction to adoption support payments set forth in chapter 50, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess. has not, to date, adversely impacted permanency for foster children in need of adoptive homes. 

Therefore, the legislature intends to continue the adoption assistance rate reduction beyond the period set forth in the operating budget, while focusing on sustainable long-term efforts to prevent children from entering the foster care system, such as pursuing a potential federal Title IV-E waiver , which if granted, would allow Washington to reinvest dollars otherwise spent on foster care in prevention programs.

The legislature also finds that many adoptive parents spend adoption support payments on additional mental health services for adoptive children that are not currently covered by existing public programs. The legislature intends to offset adoption support payment expenditures by facilitating efforts to improve the access and quality of existing mental health services for adoptive families in the long term.

\[ [2012 c 147 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2657-S.SL.pdf?cite=2012%20c%20147%20§%201); \]

## 74.13A.010 - Prospective adoptive parent's fee for cost of adoption services.
When a child proposed for adoption is placed with a prospective adoptive parent the department may charge such parent a fee in payment or part payment of such adoptive parent's part of the cost of the adoption services rendered and to be rendered by the department.

In charging such fees the department shall treat a husband and wife as a single prospective adoptive parent.

Each such fee shall be fixed according to a sliding scale based on the ability to pay of the prospective adoptive parent or parents.

Such fee scale shall be annually fixed by the secretary after considering the recommendations of the committee designated by the secretary to advise him or her on child welfare and pursuant to the regulations to be issued by the secretary in accordance with the provisions of Title 34 RCW.

The secretary may waive, defer, or provide for payment in installments without interest of, any such fee whenever in his or her judgment payment or immediate payment would cause economic hardship to such adoptive parent or parents.

Nothing in this section shall require the payment of a fee to the state of Washington in a case in which an adoption results from independent placement or placement by a licensed child-placing or supervising agency.

## 74.13A.015 - Adoption services—Disposition of fees—Use—Federal funds—Gifts and grants.
All fees paid for adoption services pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 shall be credited to the general fund. Expenses incurred in connection with supporting the adoption of hard to place children shall be paid by warrants drawn against such appropriations as may be available. The secretary may for such purposes, contract with any public agency or supervising agency and/or adoptive parent and is authorized to accept funds from other sources including federal, private, and other public funding sources to carry out such purposes.

The secretary shall actively seek, where consistent with the policies and programs of the department, and shall make maximum use of, such federal funds as are or may be made available to the department for the purpose of supporting the adoption of hard to place children. The secretary may, if permitted by federal law, deposit federal funds for adoption support, aid to adoptions, or subsidized adoption in the general fund and may use such funds, subject to such limitations as may be imposed by federal or state law, to carry out the program of adoption support authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080.

## 74.13A.020 - Adoption support program administration—Rules and regulations—Disbursements from general fund, criteria—Limits.
1. The secretary shall issue rules and regulations to assist in the administration of the program of adoption support authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080.

2. Disbursements from the appropriations available from the general fund shall be made pursuant to such rules and regulations and pursuant to agreements conforming thereto to be made by the secretary with parents for the purpose of supporting the adoption of children in, or likely to be placed in, foster homes or child caring institutions who are found by the secretary to be difficult to place in adoption because of physical or other reasons; including, but not limited to, disabilities, emotional disturbance, ethnic background, language, race, color, age, or sibling grouping.

3. Such agreements shall meet the following criteria:

   a. The child whose adoption is to be supported pursuant to such agreement shall be or have been a child hard to place in adoption.

   b. Such agreement must relate to a child who was or is residing in a foster home or child-caring institution or a child who, in the judgment of the secretary, is both eligible for, and likely to be placed in, either a foster home or a child-caring institution.

   c. Such agreement shall provide that adoption support shall not continue beyond the time that the adopted child reaches eighteen years of age, becomes emancipated, dies, or otherwise ceases to need support. If the secretary finds that continuing dependency of such child after such child reaches eighteen years of age warrants the continuation of support pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 the secretary may do so, subject to all the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, including annual review of the amount of such support.

   d. Any prospective parent who is to be a party to such agreement shall be a person who has the character, judgment, sense of responsibility, and disposition which make him or her suitable as an adoptive parent of such child.

4. At least six months before an adoption is finalized under chapter 26.33 RCW and RCW 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, the department must provide to the prospective adoptive parent, in writing, information describing the limits of the adoption support program including the following information:

   a. The limits on monthly cash payments to adoptive families;

   b. The limits on the availability of children's mental health services and the funds with which to pay for these services;

   c. The process for accessing mental health services for children receiving adoption support services;

   d. The limits on the one-time cash payments to adoptive families for expenses related to their adopted children; and

   e. That payment for residential or group care is not available for adopted children under the adoption support program.

## 74.13A.025 - Factors determining payments or adjustment in standards.
The factors to be considered by the secretary in setting the amount of any payment or payments to be made pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 and in adjusting standards hereunder shall include: The size of the family including the adoptive child, the usual living expenses of the family, the special needs of any family member including education needs, the family income, the family resources and plan for savings, the medical and hospitalization needs of the family, the family's means of purchasing or otherwise receiving such care, and any other expenses likely to be needed by the child to be adopted. In setting the amount of any initial payment made pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, the secretary is authorized to establish maximum payment amounts that are reasonable and allow permanency planning goals related to adoption of children under RCW 13.34.145 to be achieved at the earliest possible date. To encourage adoption of children between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, and in particular those children between the ages of fourteen and eighteen who are hard to place for adoption, the secretary is authorized to include as part of any new negotiated adoption agreement executed after October 19, 2017, continued eligibility for the Washington college bound scholarship pursuant to RCW 28B.118.010.

The amounts paid for the support of a child pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 may vary from family to family and from year to year. Due to changes in economic circumstances or the needs of the child such payments may be discontinued and later resumed.

Payments under RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 may be continued by the secretary subject to review as provided for herein, if such parent or parents having such child in their custody establish their residence in another state or a foreign jurisdiction.

In fixing the standards to govern the amount and character of payments to be made for the support of adopted children pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 and before issuing rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, the secretary shall consider the comments and recommendations of the committee designated by the secretary to advise him or her with respect to child welfare.

## 74.13A.030 - Both continuing payments and lump sum payments authorized.
To carry out the program authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, the secretary may make continuing payments or lump sum payments of adoption support. In lieu of continuing payments, or in addition to them, the secretary may make one or more specific lump sum payments for or on behalf of a hard to place child either to the adoptive parents or directly to other persons to assist in correcting any condition causing such child to be hard to place for adoption.

Consistent with a particular child's needs, continuing adoption support payments shall include, if necessary to facilitate or support the adoption of a special needs child, an amount sufficient to remove any reasonable financial barrier to adoption as determined by the secretary under RCW 74.13A.025.

After determination by the secretary of the amount of a payment or the initial amount of continuing payments, the prospective parent or parents who desire such support shall sign an agreement with the secretary providing for the payment, in the manner and at the time or times prescribed in regulations to be issued by the secretary subject to the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, of the amount or amounts of support so determined.

## 74.13A.040 - Review of support payments.
1. Any parent who is a party to an agreement under RCW 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 may at any time, in writing, request, for reasons set forth in such request, a review of the amount of any payment or the level of continuing payments.

If such request is not acted on within thirty days after it has been received by the secretary, such parent may invoke his or her rights under the hearing provisions set forth in RCW 74.13A.055.

2. The secretary may make adjustments in payments at the time of the review, or at other times, if the secretary finds that circumstances have changed and warrant an adjustment in payments. Changes in circumstances may include, but are not limited to, variations in medical opinions, prognosis, and costs. Appropriate adjustments in payments shall be made based upon changes in the needs of the child and/or changes in the adoptive parents' income, resources, and expenses for the care of such child or other members of the family, including medical and/or hospitalization expense not otherwise covered by or subject to reimbursement from insurance or other sources of financial assistance.

## 74.13A.050 - Agreements as contracts within state and federal Constitutions—State's continuing obligation.
An agreement for adoption support made before January 1, 1985, or pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, although subject to review and adjustment as provided for herein, shall, as to the standard used by the secretary in making such review or reviews and any such adjustment, constitutes a contract within the meaning of section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution and section 23, Article I of the state Constitution. For that reason once such an agreement has been made any review of and adjustment under such agreement shall as to the standards used by the secretary, be made only subject to the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 and such rules and regulations relating thereto as they exist on the date of the initial determination in connection with such agreement or such more generous standard or parts of such standard as may hereafter be provided for by law or regulation. Once made such an agreement shall constitute a solemn undertaking by the state of Washington with such adoptive parent or parents. The termination of the effective period of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 or a decision by the state or federal government to discontinue or reduce general appropriations made available for the purposes to be served by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, shall not affect the state's specific continuing obligations to support such adoptions, subject to such annual review and adjustment for all such agreements as have theretofore been entered into by the state.

The purpose of this section is to assure any such parent that, upon his or her consenting to assume the burdens of adopting a hard to place child, the state will not in future so act by way of general reduction of appropriations for the program authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 or ratable reductions, to impair the trust and confidence necessarily reposed by such parent in the state as a condition of such parent taking upon himself or herself the obligations of parenthood of a difficult to place child.

Should the secretary and any such adoptive parent differ as to whether any standard or part of a standard adopted by the secretary after the date of an initial agreement, which standard or part is used by the secretary in making any review and adjustment, is more generous than the standard in effect as of the date of the initial determination with respect to such agreement such adoptive parent may invoke his or her rights, including all rights of appeal under the fair hearing provisions, available to him or her under RCW 74.13A.055.

Voluntary amendments of any support agreement entered into pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and * 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 may be made at any time. In proposing any such amending action which relates to the amount or level of a payment or payments, the secretary shall, as provided in **RCW 74.13.124, use either the standard which existed as of the date of the initial determination with respect to such agreement or any subsequent standard or parts of such standard which both parties to such agreement agree is more generous than those in effect as of the date of such initial agreement. If the parties do not agree to the level of support, the secretary shall set the level. The secretary shall give the adoptive parent or parents written notice of the determination. The adoptive parent or parents aggrieved by the secretary's determination have the right to an adjudicative proceeding. The proceeding is governed by RCW 74.08.080 and chapter 34.05 RCW, the Administrative Procedure Act.
