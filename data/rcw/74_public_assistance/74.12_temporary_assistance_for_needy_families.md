## 74.12.010 - Definitions.
For the purposes of the administration of temporary assistance for needy families, the term "dependent child" means any child in need under the age of eighteen years who is living with a relative as specified under federal temporary assistance for needy families program requirements, in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or her or their homes. The term a "dependent child" shall, notwithstanding the foregoing, also include a child who would meet such requirements except for his or her removal from the home of a relative specified above as a result of a judicial determination that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child, for whose placement and care the state department of social and health services or the county office is responsible, and who has been placed in a licensed or approved child care institution or foster home as a result of such determination and who: (1) Was receiving an aid to families with dependent children grant for the month in which court proceedings leading to such determination were initiated; or (2) would have received aid to families with dependent children for such month if application had been made therefor; or (3) in the case of a child who had been living with a specified relative within six months prior to the month in which such proceedings were initiated, would have received aid to families with dependent children for such month if in such month he or she had been living with such a relative and application had been made therefor, as authorized by the social security act.

"Temporary assistance for needy families" means money payments, services, and remedial care with respect to a dependent child or dependent children and the needy parent or relative with whom the child lives.

3. The department shall consider any statements or opinions by either parent of the unmarried minor parent or pregnant minor applicant as to an appropriate living situation for the minor and his or her children, whether in the parental home or other situation.

It shall be presumed in any administrative or judicial proceeding conducted under this subsection that the parental home or other relative placement requested by the parents or parent is the most appropriate living situation. This presumption is rebuttable.

## 74.12.290 - Suitability of home—Evaluation.
The department of social and health services shall, during the initial and any subsequent determination of eligibility, evaluate the suitability of the home in which the dependent child lives, consideration to be given to physical care and supervision provided in the home; social, educational, and the moral atmosphere of the home as compared with the standards of the community; the child's physical and mental health and emotional security, special needs occasioned by the child's physical disabilities or illnesses, if any; the extent to which desirable factors outweigh the undesirable in the home; and the apparent possibility for improving undesirable conditions in the home.

## 74.12.300 - Grant during period required to eliminate undesirable conditions.
If the home in which the child lives is found to be unsuitable, but there is reason to believe that elimination of the undesirable conditions can be effected, and the child is otherwise eligible for aid, a grant shall be initiated or continued for such time as the state department of social and health services and the family require to remedy the conditions.

\[ [1979 c 141 § 353](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979c141.pdf?cite=1979%20c%20141%20§%20353); [1963 c 228 § 26](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1963c228.pdf?cite=1963%20c%20228%20§%2026); \]

## 74.12.310 - Placement of child with other relatives.
When intensive efforts over a reasonable period have failed to improve the home conditions, the department shall determine if any other relatives specified by the social security act are maintaining a suitable home and are willing to take the care and custody of the child in their home. Upon an affirmative finding the department shall, if the parents or relatives with whom the child is living consent, take the necessary steps for placement of the child with such other relatives, but if the parents or relatives with whom the child lives refuse their consent to the placement then the department shall file a petition in the juvenile court for a decree adjudging the home unsuitable and placing the dependent child with such other relatives.

## 74.12.320 - Placement of child pursuant to chapter  13.04 RCW.
If a diligent search reveals no other relatives as specified in the social security act maintaining a suitable home and willing to take custody of the child, then the department may file a petition in the appropriate juvenile court for placement of the child pursuant to the provisions of chapter 13.04 RCW.

\[ [1963 c 228 § 28](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1963c228.pdf?cite=1963%20c%20228%20§%2028); \]

## 74.12.330 - Assistance not to be denied for want of relative or court order.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter a child otherwise eligible for aid shall not be denied such assistance where a relative as specified in the social security act is unavailable or refuses to accept custody and the juvenile court fails to enter an order removing the child from the custody of the parent, relative or guardian then having custody.

\[ [1963 c 228 § 29](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1963c228.pdf?cite=1963%20c%20228%20§%2029); \]
