## 74.09A.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that:

1. Simplification in the administration of payment of health benefits is important for the state, providers, and health insurers;

2. The state, providers, and health insurers should take advantage of all opportunities to streamline operations through automation and the use of common computer standards;

3. It is in the best interests of the state, providers, and health insurers to identify all third parties that are obligated to cover the cost of health care coverage of joint beneficiaries; and

4. Health insurers, as a condition of doing business in Washington, must increase their effort to share information with the authority and accept the authority's timely claims consistent with 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25).

Therefore, the legislature declares that to improve the coordination of benefits between the health care authority and health insurers to ensure that medical insurance benefits are properly utilized, a transfer of information between the authority and health insurers should be instituted, and the process for submitting requests for information and claims should be simplified.
