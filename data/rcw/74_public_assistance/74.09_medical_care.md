The authority shall adopt rules designed to discourage whistleblower complaints made in bad faith or for retaliatory purposes.

## 74.09.402 - Children's health care—Findings—Intent.
1. The legislature finds that:

   a. Improving the health of children in Washington state is an investment in a productive and successful next generation. The health of children is critical to their success in school and throughout their lives;

   b. Healthy children are ready to learn. In order to provide students with the opportunity to become responsible citizens, to contribute to their own economic well-being and to that of their families and communities, and to enjoy productive and satisfying lives, the state recognizes the importance that access to appropriate health services and improved health brings to the children of Washington state. In addition, fully immunized children are themselves protected, and in turn protect others, from contracting communicable diseases;

   c. Children with health insurance coverage have better health outcomes than those who lack coverage. Children without health insurance coverage are more likely to be in poor health and more likely to delay receiving, or go without, needed health care services;

   d. Health care coverage for children in Washington state is the product of critical efforts in both the private and public sectors to help children succeed. Private health insurance coverage is complemented by public programs that meet needs of low-income children whose parents are not offered health insurance coverage through their employer or who cannot otherwise afford the costs of coverage. In 2006, thirty-five percent of children in Washington state had some form of public health coverage. Washington state is making progress in its efforts to increase the number of children with health care coverage. Yet, even with these efforts of both private and public sectors, many children in Washington state continue to lack health insurance coverage. In 2006, over seventy thousand children were uninsured. Almost two-thirds of these children are in families whose income is under two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level; and

   e. Improved health outcomes for the children of Washington state are the expected result of improved access to health care coverage. Linking children with a medical home that provides preventive and well child health services and referral to needed specialty services, linking children with needed behavioral health and dental services, more effectively managing childhood diseases, improving nutrition, and increasing physical activity are key to improving children's health. Care should be provided in appropriate settings by efficient providers, consistent with high quality care and at an appropriate stage, soon enough to avert the need for overly expensive treatment.

2. It is therefore the intent of the legislature that:

   a. All children in the state of Washington have health care coverage by 2010. This should be accomplished by building upon and strengthening the successes of private health insurance coverage and publicly supported children's health insurance programs in Washington state. Access to coverage should be streamlined and efficient, with reductions in unnecessary administrative costs and mechanisms to expeditiously link children with a medical home;

   b. The state, in collaboration with parents, schools, communities, health plans, and providers, take steps to improve health outcomes for the children of Washington state by linking children with a medical home, identifying health improvement goals for children, and linking innovative purchasing strategies to those goals.

## 74.09.460 - Children's affordable health coverage—Findings—Intent.
1. The legislature finds that parents have a responsibility to:

   a. Enroll their children in affordable health coverage;

   b. Ensure that their children receive appropriate well-child preventive care;

   c. Link their child with a medical home; and

   d. Understand and act upon the health benefits of good nutrition and physical activity.

2. The legislature intends that the programs and outreach and education efforts established in RCW 74.09.470(6), as well as partnerships with the public and private sectors, provide the support and information needed by parents to meet the responsibilities set forth in this section.

\[ [2007 c 5 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5093-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2007%20c%205%20§%203); \]

## 74.09.470 - Children's affordable health coverage—Authority duties.
1. Consistent with the goals established in RCW 74.09.402, through the apple health for kids program authorized in this section, the authority shall provide affordable health care coverage to children under the age of nineteen who reside in Washington state and whose family income at the time of enrollment is not greater than two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level as adjusted for family size and determined annually by the federal department of health and human services, and effective January 1, 2009, and only to the extent that funds are specifically appropriated therefor, to children whose family income is not greater than three hundred percent of the federal poverty level. In administering the program, the authority shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure the receipt of federal financial participation under the medical assistance program, as codified at Title XIX of the federal social security act, the state children's health insurance program, as codified at Title XXI of the federal social security act, and any other federal funding sources that are now available or may become available in the future. The authority and the caseload forecast council shall estimate the anticipated caseload and costs of the program established in this section.

2. The authority shall accept applications for enrollment for children's health care coverage; establish appropriate minimum-enrollment periods, as may be necessary; and determine eligibility based on current family income. The authority shall make eligibility determinations within the time frames for establishing eligibility for children on medical assistance, as defined by RCW 74.09.510. The application and annual renewal processes shall be designed to minimize administrative barriers for applicants and enrolled clients, and to minimize gaps in eligibility for families who are eligible for coverage. If a change in family income results in a change in the source of funding for coverage, the authority shall transfer the family members to the appropriate source of funding and notify the family with respect to any change in premium obligation, without a break in eligibility. The authority shall use the same eligibility redetermination and appeals procedures as those provided for children on medical assistance programs. The authority shall modify its eligibility renewal procedures to lower the percentage of children failing to annually renew. The authority shall manage its outreach, application, and renewal procedures with the goals of: (a) Achieving year by year improvements in enrollment, enrollment rates, renewals, and renewal rates; (b) maximizing the use of existing program databases to obtain information related to earned and unearned income for purposes of eligibility determination and renewals, including, but not limited to, the basic food program, the child care subsidy program, federal social security administration programs, and the employment security department wage database; (c) streamlining renewal processes to rely primarily upon data matches, online submissions, and telephone interviews; and (d) implementing any other eligibility determination and renewal processes to allow the state to receive an enhanced federal matching rate and additional federal outreach funding available through the federal children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 by January 2010. The department shall advise the governor and the legislature regarding the status of these efforts by September 30, 2009. The information provided should include the status of the department's efforts, the anticipated impact of those efforts on enrollment, and the costs associated with that enrollment.

3. To ensure continuity of care and ease of understanding for families and health care providers, and to maximize the efficiency of the program, the amount, scope, and duration of health care services provided to children under this section shall be the same as that provided to children under medical assistance, as defined in RCW 74.09.520.

4. The primary mechanism for purchasing health care coverage under this section shall be through contracts with managed health care systems as defined in RCW 74.09.522, subject to conditions, limitations, and appropriations provided in the biennial appropriations act. However, the authority shall make every effort within available resources to purchase health care coverage for uninsured children whose families have access to dependent coverage through an employer-sponsored health plan or another source when it is cost-effective for the state to do so, and the purchase is consistent with requirements of Title XIX and Title XXI of the federal social security act. To the extent allowable under federal law, the authority shall require families to enroll in available employer-sponsored coverage, as a condition of participating in the program established under this section, when it is cost-effective for the state to do so. Families who enroll in available employer- sponsored coverage under this section shall be accounted for separately in the annual report required by RCW 74.09.053.

5. [Empty]

   a. To reflect appropriate parental responsibility, the authority shall develop and implement a schedule of premiums for children's health care coverage due to the authority from families with income greater than two hundred percent of the federal poverty level. For families with income greater than two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level, the premiums shall be established in consultation with the senate majority and minority leaders and the speaker and minority leader of the house of representatives. For children eligible for coverage under the federally funded children's health insurance program, Title XXI of the federal social security act, premiums shall be set at a reasonable level that does not pose a barrier to enrollment. The amount of the premium shall be based upon family income and shall not exceed the premium limitations in Title XXI of the federal social security act. For children who are not eligible for coverage under the federally funded children's health insurance program, premiums shall be set every two years in an amount no greater than the average state-only share of the per capita cost of coverage in the state-funded children's health program.

   b. Premiums shall not be imposed on children in households at or below two hundred percent of the federal poverty level as articulated in RCW 74.09.055.

   c. Beginning no later than January 1, 2010, the authority shall offer families whose income is greater than three hundred percent of the federal poverty level the opportunity to purchase health care coverage for their children through the programs administered under this section without an explicit premium subsidy from the state. The design of the health benefit package offered to these children should provide a benefit package substantially similar to that offered in the apple health for kids program, and may differ with respect to cost-sharing, and other appropriate elements from that provided to children under subsection (3) of this section including, but not limited to, application of preexisting conditions, waiting periods, and other design changes needed to offer affordable coverage. The amount paid by the family shall be in an amount equal to the rate paid by the state to the managed health care system for coverage of the child, including any associated and administrative costs to the state of providing coverage for the child. Any pooling of the program enrollees that results in state fiscal impact must be identified and brought to the legislature for consideration.

6. The authority shall undertake and continue a proactive, targeted outreach and education effort with the goal of enrolling children in health coverage and improving the health literacy of youth and parents. The authority shall collaborate with the department of social and health services, department of health, local public health jurisdictions, the office of the superintendent of public instruction, the department of children, youth, and families, health educators, health care providers, health carriers, community-based organizations, and parents in the design and development of this effort. The outreach and education effort shall include the following components:

   a. Broad dissemination of information about the availability of coverage, including media campaigns;

   b. Assistance with completing applications, and community-based outreach efforts to help people apply for coverage. Community-based outreach efforts should be targeted to the populations least likely to be covered;

   c. Use of existing systems, such as enrollment information from the free and reduced-price lunch program, the department of children, youth, and families child care subsidy program, the department of health's women, infants, and children program, and the early childhood education and assistance program, to identify children who may be eligible but not enrolled in coverage;

   d. Contracting with community-based organizations and government entities to support community-based outreach efforts to help families apply for coverage. These efforts should be targeted to the populations least likely to be covered. The authority shall provide informational materials for use by government entities and community-based organizations in their outreach activities, and should identify any available federal matching funds to support these efforts;

   e. Development and dissemination of materials to engage and inform parents and families statewide on issues such as: The benefits of health insurance coverage; the appropriate use of health services, including primary care provided by health care practitioners licensed under chapters 18.71, 18.57, 18.36A, and 18.79 RCW, and emergency services; the value of a medical home, well-child services and immunization, and other preventive health services with linkages to department of health child profile efforts; identifying and managing chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes; and the value of good nutrition and physical activity;

   f. An evaluation of the outreach and education efforts, based upon clear, cost-effective outcome measures that are included in contracts with entities that undertake components of the outreach and education effort;

   g. An implementation plan to develop online application capability that is integrated with the automated client eligibility system, and to develop data linkages with the office of the superintendent of public instruction for free and reduced-price lunch enrollment information and the department of children, youth, and families for child care subsidy program enrollment information.

7. The authority shall take action to increase the number of primary care physicians providing dental disease preventive services including oral health screenings, risk assessment, family education, the application of fluoride varnish, and referral to a dentist as needed.

8. The department shall monitor the rates of substitution between private-sector health care coverage and the coverage provided under this section.

## 74.09.522 - Medical assistance—Agreements with managed health care systems for provision of services to medicaid recipients—Principles to be applied in purchasing managed health care.
1. For the purposes of this section:

   a. "Managed health care system" means any health care organization, including health care providers, insurers, health care service contractors, health maintenance organizations, health insuring organizations, or any combination thereof, that provides directly or by contract health care services covered under this chapter or other applicable law and rendered by licensed providers, on a prepaid capitated basis and that meets the requirements of section 1903(m)(1)(A) of Title XIX of the federal social security act or federal demonstration waivers granted under section 1115(a) of Title XI of the federal social security act;

   b. "Nonparticipating provider" means a person, health care provider, practitioner, facility, or entity, acting within their scope of practice, that does not have a written contract to participate in a managed health care system's provider network, but provides health care services to enrollees of programs authorized under this chapter or other applicable law whose health care services are provided by the managed health care system.

2. The authority shall enter into agreements with managed health care systems to provide health care services to recipients of medicaid under the following conditions:

   a. Agreements shall be made for at least thirty thousand recipients statewide;

   b. Agreements in at least one county shall include enrollment of all recipients of programs as allowed for in the approved state plan amendment or federal waiver for Washington state's medicaid program;

   c. To the extent that this provision is consistent with section 1903(m) of Title XIX of the federal social security act or federal demonstration waivers granted under section 1115(a) of Title XI of the federal social security act, recipients shall have a choice of systems in which to enroll and shall have the right to terminate their enrollment in a system: PROVIDED, That the authority may limit recipient termination of enrollment without cause to the first month of a period of enrollment, which period shall not exceed twelve months: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That the authority shall not restrict a recipient's right to terminate enrollment in a system for good cause as established by the authority by rule;

   d. To the extent that this provision is consistent with section 1903(m) of Title XIX of the federal social security act, participating managed health care systems shall not enroll a disproportionate number of medical assistance recipients within the total numbers of persons served by the managed health care systems, except as authorized by the authority under federal demonstration waivers granted under section 1115(a) of Title XI of the federal social security act;

   e. [Empty]

      i. In negotiating with managed health care systems the authority shall adopt a uniform procedure to enter into contractual arrangements, including:

         A.  Standards regarding the quality of services to be provided;

         B.  The financial integrity of the responding system;

         C.  Provider reimbursement methods that incentivize chronic care management within health homes, including comprehensive medication management services for patients with multiple chronic conditions consistent with the findings and goals established in RCW 74.09.5223;

         D.  Provider reimbursement methods that reward health homes that, by using chronic care management, reduce emergency department and inpatient use;

         E.  Promoting provider participation in the program of training and technical assistance regarding care of people with chronic conditions described in RCW 43.70.533, including allocation of funds to support provider participation in the training, unless the managed care system is an integrated health delivery system that has programs in place for chronic care management;

         F.  Provider reimbursement methods within the medical billing processes that incentivize pharmacists or other qualified providers licensed in Washington state to provide comprehensive medication management services consistent with the findings and goals established in RCW 74.09.5223;

         G.  Evaluation and reporting on the impact of comprehensive medication management services on patient clinical outcomes and total health care costs, including reductions in emergency department utilization, hospitalization, and drug costs; and

         H.  Established consistent processes to incentivize integration of behavioral health services in the primary care setting, promoting care that is integrated, collaborative, colocated, and preventive.

      ii. [Empty]

          A.  Health home services contracted for under this subsection may be prioritized to enrollees with complex, high cost, or multiple chronic conditions.

          B.  Contracts that include the items in (e)(i)(C) through (G) of this subsection must not exceed the rates that would be paid in the absence of these provisions;

   f. The authority shall seek waivers from federal requirements as necessary to implement this chapter;

   g. The authority shall, wherever possible, enter into prepaid capitation contracts that include inpatient care. However, if this is not possible or feasible, the authority may enter into prepaid capitation contracts that do not include inpatient care;

   h. The authority shall define those circumstances under which a managed health care system is responsible for out-of-plan services and assure that recipients shall not be charged for such services;

   i. Nothing in this section prevents the authority from entering into similar agreements for other groups of people eligible to receive services under this chapter; and

   j. The authority must consult with the federal center for medicare and medicaid innovation and seek funding opportunities to support health homes.

3. The authority shall ensure that publicly supported community health centers and providers in rural areas, who show serious intent and apparent capability to participate as managed health care systems are seriously considered as contractors. The authority shall coordinate its managed care activities with activities under chapter 70.47 RCW.

4. The authority shall work jointly with the state of Oregon and other states in this geographical region in order to develop recommendations to be presented to the appropriate federal agencies and the United States congress for improving health care of the poor, while controlling related costs.

5. The legislature finds that competition in the managed health care marketplace is enhanced, in the long term, by the existence of a large number of managed health care system options for medicaid clients. In a managed care delivery system, whose goal is to focus on prevention, primary care, and improved enrollee health status, continuity in care relationships is of substantial importance, and disruption to clients and health care providers should be minimized. To help ensure these goals are met, the following principles shall guide the authority in its healthy options managed health care purchasing efforts:

   a. All managed health care systems should have an opportunity to contract with the authority to the extent that minimum contracting requirements defined by the authority are met, at payment rates that enable the authority to operate as far below appropriated spending levels as possible, consistent with the principles established in this section.

   b. Managed health care systems should compete for the award of contracts and assignment of medicaid beneficiaries who do not voluntarily select a contracting system, based upon:

      i. Demonstrated commitment to or experience in serving low-income populations;

      ii. Quality of services provided to enrollees;

      iii. Accessibility, including appropriate utilization, of services offered to enrollees;

      iv. Demonstrated capability to perform contracted services, including ability to supply an adequate provider network;

      v. Payment rates; and

      vi. The ability to meet other specifically defined contract requirements established by the authority, including consideration of past and current performance and participation in other state or federal health programs as a contractor.

   c. Consideration should be given to using multiple year contracting periods.

   d. Quality, accessibility, and demonstrated commitment to serving low-income populations shall be given significant weight in the contracting, evaluation, and assignment process.

   e. All contractors that are regulated health carriers must meet state minimum net worth requirements as defined in applicable state laws. The authority shall adopt rules establishing the minimum net worth requirements for contractors that are not regulated health carriers. This subsection does not limit the authority of the Washington state health care authority to take action under a contract upon finding that a contractor's financial status seriously jeopardizes the contractor's ability to meet its contract obligations.

   f. Procedures for resolution of disputes between the authority and contract bidders or the authority and contracting carriers related to the award of, or failure to award, a managed care contract must be clearly set out in the procurement document.

6. The authority may apply the principles set forth in subsection (5) of this section to its managed health care purchasing efforts on behalf of clients receiving supplemental security income benefits to the extent appropriate.

7. Any contract with a managed health care system to provide services to medical assistance enrollees shall require that managed health care systems offer contracts to mental health providers and substance use disorder treatment providers to provide access to primary care services integrated into behavioral health clinical settings, for individuals with behavioral health and medical comorbidities.

8. Managed health care system contracts effective on or after April 1, 2016, shall serve geographic areas that correspond to the regional service areas established in RCW 74.09.870.

9. A managed health care system shall pay a nonparticipating provider that provides a service covered under this chapter or other applicable law to the system's enrollee no more than the lowest amount paid for that service under the managed health care system's contracts with similar providers in the state if the managed health care system has made good faith efforts to contract with the nonparticipating provider.

10. For services covered under this chapter or other applicable law to medical assistance or medical care services enrollees, nonparticipating providers must accept as payment in full the amount paid by the managed health care system under subsection (9) of this section in addition to any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment that is due from the enrollee for the service provided. An enrollee is not liable to any nonparticipating provider for covered services, except for amounts due for any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment under the terms and conditions set forth in the managed health care system contract to provide services under this section.

11. Pursuant to federal managed care access standards, 42 C.F.R. Sec. 438, managed health care systems must maintain a network of appropriate providers that is supported by written agreements sufficient to provide adequate access to all services covered under the contract with the authority, including hospital-based physician services. The authority will monitor and periodically report on the proportion of services provided by contracted providers and nonparticipating providers, by county, for each managed health care system to ensure that managed health care systems are meeting network adequacy requirements. No later than January 1st of each year, the authority will review and report its findings to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature for the preceding state fiscal year.

12. Payments under RCW 74.60.130 are exempt from this section.

## 74.09.5222 - Medical assistance—Section 1115 demonstration waiver request.
1. The authority shall submit a section 1115 demonstration waiver request to the federal department of health and human services to expand and revise the medical assistance program as codified in Title XIX of the federal social security act. The waiver request should be designed to ensure the broadest federal financial participation under Title XIX and XXI of the federal social security act. To the extent permitted under federal law, the waiver request should include the following components:

   a. Establishment of a single eligibility standard for low-income persons, including expansion of categorical eligibility to include childless adults. The authority shall request that the single eligibility standard be phased in such that incremental steps are taken to cover additional low-income parents and individuals over time, with the goal of offering coverage to persons with household income at or below two hundred percent of the federal poverty level;

   b. Establishment of a single seamless application and eligibility determination system for all state low-income medical programs included in the waiver. Applications may be electronic and may include an electronic signature for verification and authentication. Eligibility determinations should maximize federal financing where possible;

   c. The delivery of all low-income coverage programs as a single program, with a common core benefit package that may be similar to the basic health benefit package or an alternative benefit package approved by the secretary of the federal department of health and human services, including the option of supplemental coverage for select categorical groups, such as children, and individuals who are aged, blind, and disabled;

   d. A program design to include creative and innovative approaches such as: Coverage for preventive services with incentives to use appropriate preventive care; enhanced medical home reimbursement and bundled payment methodologies; cost-sharing options; use of care management and care coordination programs to improve coordination of medical and behavioral health services; application of an innovative predictive risk model to better target care management services; and mandatory enrollment in managed care, as may be necessary;

   e. The ability to impose enrollment limits or benefit design changes for eligibility groups that were not eligible under the Title XIX state plan in effect on the date of submission of the waiver application;

   f. A premium assistance program whereby employers can participate in coverage options for employees and dependents of employees otherwise eligible under the waiver. The waiver should make every effort to maximize enrollment in employer-sponsored health insurance when it is cost-effective for the state to do so, and the purchase is consistent with the requirements of Titles XIX and XXI of the federal social security act. To the extent allowable under federal law, the authority shall require enrollment in available employer-sponsored coverage as a condition of eligibility for coverage under the waiver; and

   g. The ability to share savings that might accrue to the federal medicare program, Title XVIII of the federal social security act, from improved care management for persons who are eligible for both medicare and medicaid. Through the waiver application process, the authority shall determine whether the state could serve, directly or by contract, as a medicare special needs plan for persons eligible for both medicare and medicaid.

2. The authority shall hold ongoing stakeholder discussions as it is developing the waiver request, and provide opportunities for public review and comment as the request is being developed.

3. The authority shall identify statutory changes that may be necessary to ensure successful and timely implementation of the waiver request as submitted to the federal department of health and human services as the apple health program for adults.

4. The legislature must authorize implementation of any waiver approved by the federal department of health and human services under this section.

## 74.09.5225 - Medical assistance—Payments for services provided by rural hospitals—Participation in Washington rural health access preservation pilot.
1. Payments for recipients eligible for medical assistance programs under this chapter for services provided by hospitals, regardless of the beneficiary's managed care enrollment status, shall be made based on allowable costs incurred during the year, when services are provided by a rural hospital certified by the centers for medicare and medicaid services as a critical access hospital, unless the critical access hospital is participating in the Washington rural health access preservation pilot described in subsection (2)(b) of this section. Any additional payments made by the authority for the healthy options program shall be no more than the additional amounts per service paid under this section for other medical assistance programs.

2. [Empty]

   a. Beginning on July 24, 2005, except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a moratorium shall be placed on additional hospital participation in critical access hospital payments under this section. However, rural hospitals that applied for certification to the centers for medicare and medicaid services prior to January 1, 2005, but have not yet completed the process or have not yet been approved for certification, remain eligible for medical assistance payments under this section.

   b. [Empty]

      i. The purpose of the Washington rural health access preservation pilot is to develop an alternative service and payment system to the critical access hospital authorized under section 1820 of the social security act to sustain essential services in rural communities.

      ii. For the purposes of state law, any rural hospital approved by the department of health for participation in critical access hospital payments under this section that participates in the Washington rural health access preservation pilot identified by the state office of rural health and ceases to participate in critical access hospital payments may renew participation in critical access hospital associated payment methodologies under this section at any time.

      iii. The Washington rural health access preservation pilot is subject to the following requirements:

           A.  In the pilot formation or development, the department of health, health care authority, and Washington state hospital association will identify goals for the pilot project before any hospital joins the pilot project;

           B.  Participation in the pilot is optional and no hospital may be required to join the pilot;

           C.  Before a hospital enters the pilot program, the health care authority must provide information to the hospital regarding how the hospital could end its participation in the pilot if the pilot is not working in its community;

           D.  Payments for services delivered by public health care service districts participating in the Washington rural health access preservation pilot to recipients eligible for medical assistance programs under this chapter must be based on an alternative, value-based payment methodology established by the authority. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the payment methodology must provide sufficient funding to sustain essential services in the areas served, including but not limited to emergency and primary care services. The methodology must adjust payment amounts based on measures of quality and value, rather than volume. As part of the pilot, the health care authority shall encourage additional payers to use the adopted payment methodology for services delivered by the pilot participants to individuals insured by those payers;

           E.  The department of health, health care authority, and Washington state hospital association will report interim progress to the legislature no later than December 1, 2018, and will report on the results of the pilot no later than six months following the conclusion of the pilot. The reports will describe any policy changes identified during the course of the pilot that would support small critical access hospitals; and

           F.  Funds appropriated for the Washington rural health access preservation pilot will be used to help participating hospitals transition to a new payment methodology and will not extend beyond the anticipated three-year pilot period.

3. [Empty]

   a. Beginning January 1, 2015, payments for recipients eligible for medical assistance programs under this chapter for services provided by a hospital, regardless of the beneficiary's managed care enrollment status, shall be increased to one hundred twenty-five percent of the hospital's fee-for-service rates, when services are provided by a rural hospital that:

      i. Was certified by the centers for medicare and medicaid services as a sole community hospital as of January 1, 2013;

      ii. Had a level III adult trauma service designation from the department of health as of January 1, 2014;

      iii. Had less than one hundred fifty acute care licensed beds in fiscal year 2011; and

      iv. Is owned and operated by the state or a political subdivision.

   b. The enhanced payment rates under this subsection shall be considered the hospital's medicaid payment rate for purposes of any other state or private programs that pay hospitals according to medicaid payment rates.

   c. Hospitals participating in the certified public expenditures program may not receive the increased reimbursement rates provided in this subsection (3) for inpatient services.

## 74.09.5229 - Primary care health homes—Chronic care management—Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that:

1. Health care costs are growing rapidly, exceeding the consumer price index year after year. Consequently, state health programs are capturing a growing share of the state budget, even as state revenues have declined. Sustaining these critical health programs will require actions to effectively contain health care cost increases in the future; and

2. The primary care health home model has been demonstrated to successfully constrain costs, while improving quality of care. Chronic care management, occurring within a primary care health home, has been shown to be especially effective at reducing costs and improving quality. However, broad adoption of these models has been impeded by a fee-for-service system that reimburses volume of services and does not adequately support important primary care health home services, such as case management and patient outreach. Furthermore, successful implementation will require a broad adoption effort by private and public payers, in coordination with providers.

Therefore the legislature intends to promote the adoption of primary care health homes for children and adults and, within them, advance the practice of chronic care management to improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs. To facilitate the best coordination and patient care, primary care health homes are encouraged to collaborate with other providers currently outside the medical insurance model. Successful chronic care management for persons receiving long-term care services in addition to medical care will require close coordination between primary care providers, long-term care workers, and other long-term care service providers, including area agencies on aging. Primary care providers also should consider oral health coordination through collaboration with dental providers and, when possible, delivery of oral health prevention services. The legislature also intends that the methods and approach of the primary care health home become part of basic primary care medical education.

6. The department must develop and implement a coordinated plan to provide education about PACE program site operations under this section. The plan must include:

   a. A strategy to assure that case managers and other staff with responsibilities related to eligibility determinations discuss the option and potential benefits of participating in a PACE program with all eligible long-term care clients;

   b. Requirements that all clients eligible for placement in the community options program entry system waiver program that are age fifty-five or over and reside in a PACE service area be referred to the PACE provider for evaluation. The department's plan must assure that referrals are conducted in a manner that is consistent with federal requirements of Title XIX of the federal social security act; and

   c. Requirements for additional and ongoing training for case managers and other staff with responsibilities related to eligibility determinations in those counties in which a PACE program is operating.

2. Research has demonstrated that children of unintended pregnancies receive less prenatal care and are at higher risk for premature birth, low birth weight, neurological disorders, and poor academic performance;

3. In Washington state, over fifty percent of unintended pregnancies occur in women age twenty-five years and older;

4. Washington state's take charge program has been successful in helping women avoid unintended pregnancies; however, when the caseload declined due to federally mandated changes, the rate of unintended pregnancies increased dramatically;

5. Expanding family planning services to cover women to two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level would align that program's eligibility standard with income eligibility for publicly funded maternity care service; and

6. Such an expansion would reduce unintended pregnancies and associated costs to the state.

   a. "Applicant" means any person who has made a request, or on behalf of whom a request has been made to the authority for any medical services program established under chapter 74.09 RCW.

   b. "Recipient" means a person who is receiving benefits from the authority for any medical services program established in this chapter.

3. An applicant or recipient has no right to an adjudicative proceeding when the sole basis for the authority's decision is a federal or state law requiring an assistance adjustment for a class of applicants or recipients.

4. An applicant or recipient may file an application for an adjudicative proceeding with either the authority or the department and must do so within ninety calendar days after receiving notice of the aggrieving decision. The authority shall determine which agency is responsible for representing the state of Washington in the hearing, in accordance with agreements entered pursuant to RCW 41.05.021.

5. [Empty]

   a. The adjudicative proceeding is governed by the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, and this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to adjudicative proceedings in which an appellant seeks review of decisions made by more than one agency. When an appellant files a single application for an adjudicative proceeding seeking review of decisions by more than one agency, this review shall be conducted initially in one adjudicative proceeding. The presiding officer may sever the proceeding into multiple proceedings on the motion of any of the parties, when:

      i. All parties consent to the severance; or

      ii. Either party requests severance without another party's consent, and the presiding officer finds there is good cause for severing the matter and that the proposed severance is not likely to prejudice the rights of an appellant who is a party to any of the severed proceedings.

   b. If there are multiple adjudicative proceedings involving common issues or parties where there is one appellant and both the authority and the department are parties, upon motion of any party or upon his or her own motion, the presiding offer may consolidate the proceedings if he or she finds that the consolidation is not likely to prejudice the rights of the appellant who is a party to any of the consolidated proceedings.

   c. The adjudicative proceeding shall be conducted at the local community services office or other location in Washington convenient to the applicant or recipient and, upon agreement by the applicant or recipient, may be conducted telephonically.

   d. The applicant or recipient, or his or her representative, has the right to inspect his or her file from the authority and, upon request, to receive copies of authority documents relevant to the proceedings free of charge.

   e. The applicant or recipient has the right to a copy of the audio recording of the adjudicative proceeding free of charge.

   f. If a final adjudicative order is issued in favor of an applicant, medical services benefits must be provided from the date of earliest eligibility, the date of denial of the application for assistance, or forty-five days following the date of application, whichever is soonest. If a final adjudicative order is issued in favor of a recipient, medical services benefits must be provided from the effective date of the authority's decision.

   g. The authority is limited to recovering an overpayment arising from assistance being continued pending the adjudicative proceeding to the amount recoverable up to the sixtieth day after the director's receipt of the application for an adjudicative proceeding.

6. If the director requires that a party seek administrative review of an initial order to an adjudicative proceeding governed by this section, in order for the party to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to RCW 34.05.534, the director shall adopt and implement rules in accordance with this subsection.

   a. The director, in consultation with the secretary, shall adopt rules to create a process for parties to seek administrative review of initial orders issued pursuant to RCW 34.05.461 in adjudicative proceedings governed by this subsection when multiple agencies are parties.

   b. This process shall seek to minimize any procedural complexities imposed on appellants that result from multiple agencies being parties to the matter, without prejudicing the rights of parties who are public assistance applicants or recipients.

   c. Nothing in this subsection shall impose or modify any legal requirement that a party seek administrative review of initial orders in order to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to RCW 34.05.534.

7. This subsection only applies to an adjudicative proceeding in which the appellant is an applicant for or recipient of medical services programs established under this chapter and the issue is his or her eligibility or ineligibility due to the assignment or transfer of a resource. The burden is on the authority or its authorized agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the person knowingly and willingly assigned or transferred the resource at less than market value for the purpose of qualifying or continuing to qualify for medical services programs established under this chapter. If the prevailing party in the adjudicative proceeding is the applicant or recipient, he or she is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees.

8. When an applicant or recipient files a petition for judicial review as provided in RCW 34.05.514 of an adjudicative order entered with respect to the medical services program, no filing fee may be collected from the person and no bond may be required on any appeal. In the event that the superior court, the court of appeals, or the supreme court renders a decision in favor of the applicant or recipient, the person is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. If a decision of the court is made in favor of an applicant, assistance shall be paid from the date of earliest eligibility, the date of the denial of the application for assistance, or forty-five days following the date of application, whichever is soonest. If a decision of the court is made in favor of a recipient, assistance shall be paid from the effective date of the authority's decision.

9. The provisions of RCW 74.08.080 do not apply to adjudicative proceedings requested or conducted with respect to the medical services program pursuant to this section.

10. The authority shall adopt any rules it deems necessary to implement this section.

## 74.09.756 - Medicaid and state children's health insurance program demonstration project.
1. By October 1, 2011, the department shall submit a request to the centers for medicare and medicaid services' innovation center and, if necessary, a request under section 1115 of the social security act, to implement a medicaid and state children's health insurance program demonstration project. The demonstration project shall be designed to achieve the broadest federal financial participation and, to the extent permitted under federal law, shall authorize:

   a. Establishment of base-year, eligibility group per capita payments, with maximum flexibility provided to the state for managing the health care trend and provisions for shared savings if per capita expenditures are below the negotiated rates. The capped eligibility group per capita payments shall: (i) Be based on targeted per capita costs for the full duration of the demonstration period; (ii) include due consideration and flexibility for unforeseen events, changes in the delivery of health care, and changes in federal or state law; and (iii) take into account the effect of the federal patient protection and affordable care act on federal resources devoted to medicaid and state children's health insurance programs. Federal payments for each eligibility group shall be based on the product of the negotiated per capita payments for the eligibility group multiplied by the actual caseload for the eligibility group;

   b. Coverage of benefits determined to be essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of the federal patient protection and affordable care act, 42 U.S.C. 18022(b), with coverage of benefits in addition to the essential health benefits as appropriate for distinct categories of enrollees such as children, pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, and elderly adults;

   c. Limited, reasonable, and enforceable cost sharing and premiums to encourage informed consumer behavior and appropriate utilization of health services, while ensuring that access to evidence-based, preventative and primary care is not hindered;

   d. Streamlined eligibility determinations;

   e. Innovative reimbursement methods such as bundled, global, and risk-bearing payment arrangements, that promote effective purchasing, efficient use of health services, and support health homes, accountable care organizations, and other innovations intended to contain costs, improve health, and incent smart consumer decision making;

   f. Clients to voluntarily enroll in the insurance exchange, and broadened enrollment in employer-sponsored insurance when available and deemed cost-effective for the state, with authority to require clients to remain enrolled in their chosen plan for the calendar year;

   g. An expedited process of forty-five days or less in which the centers for medicare and medicaid services must respond to any state request for changes to the demonstration project once it is implemented to ensure that the state has the necessary flexibility to manage within its eligibility group per capita payment caps; and

   h. The development of an alternative payment methodology for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics that enables capitated or global payment of enhanced payments.

2. The department shall provide status reports to the joint legislative select committee on health reform implementation as requested by the committee.

3. The department shall provide multiple opportunities for stakeholders and the general public to review and comment on the request as it developed.

4. The department shall identify changes to state law necessary to ensure successful and timely implementation of the demonstration project.

## 74.09.758 - Medicaid procurement of services—Value-based contracting for medicaid and public employee purchasing.
1. The authority and the department may restructure medicaid procurement of health care services and agreements with managed care systems on a phased basis to better support integrated physical health, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment, consistent with assumptions in Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6312, Laws of 2014, and recommendations provided by the behavioral health task force. The authority and the department may develop and utilize innovative mechanisms to promote and sustain integrated clinical models of physical and behavioral health care.

2. The authority and the department may incorporate the following principles into future medicaid procurement efforts aimed at integrating the delivery of physical and behavioral health services:

   a. Medicaid purchasing must support delivery of integrated, person-centered care that addresses the spectrum of individuals' health needs in the context of the communities in which they live and with the availability of care continuity as their health needs change;

   b. Accountability for the client outcomes established in RCW 71.24.435 and 71.36.025 and performance measures linked to those outcomes;

   c. Medicaid benefit design must recognize that adequate preventive care, crisis intervention, and support services promote a recovery-focused approach;

   d. Evidence-based care interventions and continuous quality improvement must be enforced through contract specifications and performance measures that provide meaningful integration at the patient care level with broadly distributed accountability for results;

   e. Active purchasing and oversight of medicaid managed care contracts is a state responsibility;

   f. A deliberate and flexible system change plan with identified benchmarks to promote system stability, provide continuity of treatment for patients, and protect essential existing behavioral health system infrastructure and capacity; and

   g. Community and organizational readiness are key determinants of implementation timing; a phased approach is therefore desirable.

3. The principles identified in subsection (2) of this section are not intended to create an individual entitlement to services.

4. The authority shall increase the use of value-based contracting, alternative quality contracting, and other payment incentives that promote quality, efficiency, cost savings, and health improvement, for medicaid and public employee purchasing. The authority shall also implement additional chronic disease management techniques that reduce the subsequent need for hospitalization or readmissions. It is the intent of the legislature that the reforms the authority implements under this subsection are anticipated to reduce extraneous medical costs, across all medical programs, when fully phased in by fiscal year 2017 to generate budget savings identified in the omnibus appropriations act.

\[ [1989 1st ex.s. c 10 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989ex1c10.pdf?cite=1989%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2010%20§%201); \]

## 74.09.770 - Maternity care access system established.
1. The legislature finds that Washington state and the nation as a whole have a high rate of infant illness and death compared with other industrialized nations. This is especially true for minority and low-income populations. Premature and low weight births have been directly linked to infant illness and death. The availability of adequate maternity care throughout the course of pregnancy has been identified as a major factor in reducing infant illness and death. Further, the investment in preventive health care programs, such as maternity care, contributes to the growth of a healthy and productive society and is a sound approach to health care cost containment. The legislature further finds that access to maternity care for low-income women in the state of Washington has declined significantly in recent years and has reached a crisis level.

2. It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide, consistent with appropriated funds, maternity care necessary to ensure healthy birth outcomes for low-income families. To this end, a maternity care access system is established based on the following principles:

   a. The family is the fundamental unit in our society and should be supported through public policy.

   b. Access to maternity care for eligible persons to ensure healthy birth outcomes should be made readily available in an expeditious manner through a single service entry point.

   c. Unnecessary barriers to maternity care for eligible persons should be removed.

   d. Access to preventive and other health care services should be available for low-income children.

   e. Each woman should be encouraged to and assisted in making her own informed decisions about her maternity care.

   f. Unnecessary barriers to the provision of maternity care by qualified health professionals should be removed.

   g. The system should be sensitive to cultural differences among eligible persons.

   h. To the extent possible, decisions about the scope, content, and delivery of services should be made at the local level involving a broad representation of community interests.

   i. The maternity care access system should be evaluated at appropriate intervals to determine effectiveness and need for modification.

   j. Maternity care services should be delivered in a cost-effective manner.

## 74.09.780 - Reservation of legislative power.
The legislature reserves the right to amend or repeal all or any part of this subchapter at any time and there shall be no vested private right of any kind against such amendment or repeal. All rights, privileges, or immunities conferred by this subchapter or any acts done pursuant thereto shall exist subject to the power of the legislature to amend or repeal this subchapter at any time.

## 74.09.810 - Alternative maternity care service delivery system established—Remedial action report.
1. The authority shall establish an alternative maternity care service delivery system, if it determines that a county or a group of counties is a maternity care distressed area. A maternity care distressed area shall be defined by the authority, in rule, as a county or a group of counties where eligible women are unable to obtain adequate maternity care. The authority shall include the following factors in its determination:

   a. Higher than average percentage of eligible persons in the distressed area who receive late or no prenatal care;
