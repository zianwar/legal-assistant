## 74.39A.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that the aging of the population and advanced medical technology have resulted in a growing number of persons who require assistance. The primary resource for long-term care continues to be family and friends. However, these traditional caregivers are increasingly employed outside the home. There is a growing demand for improvement and expansion of home and community-based long-term care services to support and complement the services provided by these informal caregivers.

The legislature further finds that the public interest would best be served by a broad array of long-term care services that support persons who need such services at home or in the community whenever practicable and that promote individual autonomy, dignity, and choice.

The legislature finds that as other long-term care options become more available, the relative need for nursing home beds is likely to decline. The legislature recognizes, however, that nursing home care will continue to be a critical part of the state's long-term care options, and that such services should promote individual dignity, autonomy, and a homelike environment.

The legislature finds that many recipients of in-home services are vulnerable and their health and well-being are dependent on their caregivers. The quality, skills, and knowledge of their caregivers are often the key to good care. The legislature finds that the need for well-trained caregivers is growing as the state's population ages and clients' needs increase. The legislature intends that current training standards be enhanced.

## 74.39A.007 - Purpose and intent.
It is the legislature's intent that:

1. Long-term care services administered by the department of social and health services include a balanced array of health, social, and supportive services that promote individual choice, dignity, and the highest practicable level of independence;

2. Home and community-based services be developed, expanded, or maintained in order to meet the needs of consumers and to maximize effective use of limited resources;

3. Long-term care services be responsive and appropriate to individual need and also cost-effective for the state;

4. Nursing home care is provided in such a manner and in such an environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each resident and timely discharge to a less restrictive care setting when appropriate; and

5. State health planning for nursing home bed supply take into account increased availability of other home and community-based service options.

## 74.39A.032 - Medicaid payment methodology for certain contracted assisted living facilities—Established by rule—Required components.
1. The department shall establish in rule a new medicaid payment system for contracted assisted living, adult residential care, and enhanced adult residential care. Beginning July 1, 2019, payments for these contracts must be based on the new methodology which must be phased-in to full implementation according to funding made available by the legislature for this purpose. The new payment system must have these components: Client care, operations, and room and board.

2. Client care is the labor component of the system and must include variables to recognize the time and intensity of client care and services, staff wages, and associated fringe benefits. The wage variable in the client care component must be adjusted according to service areas based on labor costs.

   a. The time variable is used to weight the client care payment to client acuity and must be scaled according to the classification levels utilized in the department's assessment tool. The initial system shall establish a variable for time using the residential care time study conducted in 2001 and the department's corresponding estimate of the average staff hours per client by job position.

   b. The wage variable shall include recognition of staff positions needed to perform the functions required by contract, including nursing services. Data used to establish the wage variable must be adjusted so that no baseline wage is below the state minimum in effect at the time of implementation. The wage variable is a blended wage based on the federal bureau of labor statistics wage data and the distribution of time according to staff position. Blended wages are established for each county and then counties are arrayed from highest to lowest. Service areas are established and the median blended wage in each service area becomes the wage variable for all the assigned counties in that service area. The system must have no less than two service areas, one of which shall be a high labor cost service area and shall include counties at or above the ninety-fifth percentile in the array of blended wages.

   c. The fringe benefit variable recognizes employee benefits and payroll taxes. The factor to calculate the percentage of fringe benefits shall be established using the statewide nursing facility cost ratio of benefits and payroll taxes to in-house wages.

3. The operations component must recognize costs that are allowable under federal medicaid rules for the federal matching percentage. The operations component is calculated at ninety percent or greater of the statewide median nursing facility costs associated with the following:

   a. Supplies;

   b. Nonlabor administrative expenses;

   c. Staff education and in-service training; and

   d. Operational overhead including licenses, insurance, and business and occupational [occupation] taxes.

4. The room and board component recognizes costs that do not qualify for federal financial participation under medicaid rules by compensating providers for the medicaid client's share of raw food and shelter costs including expenses related to the physical plant such as property taxes, property and liability insurance, debt service, and major capital repairs. The room and board component is subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.

5. Subsections (2) and (3) of this section establish the rate for medicaid covered services. Subsection (4) of this section establishes the rate for nonmedicaid covered services.

6. The rates paid on July 1, 2019, shall be based on data from the 2016 calendar year, except for the time variable under subsection (2)(a) of this section. The client care and operations components must be rebased in even-numbered years. Beginning with rates paid on July 1, 2020, wages, benefits and taxes, and operations costs shall be rebased using 2018 data.

7. Beginning July 1, 2020, the room and board component shall be updated annually subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.

   b. Up to twenty-five percent of the moneys may be distributed by a competitive grant process to expand the meals on wheels program into areas not presently being served.

   c. Up to five percent of the moneys may be used by the department administration, monitoring of the grants, and providing technical assistance to existing and new meals on wheels providers.

2. The department must develop criteria for awarding grants under subsection (1)(b) of this section. The criteria must include, but is not limited to:

   a. Expanding service in areas with the greatest need to assist low-income homebound seniors who are unable to prepare food for themselves and lack a caregiver that prepares meals;

   b. Expanding services in areas where senior citizens have limited access to community support services and facilities; and

   c. Geographic diversity within the state and between rural and urban areas.

After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license or contract suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents and to enforce compliance with this chapter.

   f. Substantiated complaints of neglect, abuse, exploitation, or abandonment of residents, or suspected criminal violations, shall also be referred by the department to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, and appropriate professional disciplining authority.

6. The department may provide the substance of the complaint to the licensee or contractor before the completion of the investigation by the department unless such disclosure would reveal the identity of a complainant, witness, or resident who chooses to remain anonymous. Neither the substance of the complaint provided to the licensee or contractor nor any copy of the complaint or related report published, released, or made otherwise available shall disclose, or reasonably lead to the disclosure of, the name, title, or identity of any complainant, or other person mentioned in the complaint, except that the name of the provider and the name or names of any officer, employee, or agent of the department conducting the investigation shall be disclosed after the investigation has been closed and the complaint has been substantiated. The department may disclose the identity of the complainant if such disclosure is requested in writing by the complainant. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to interfere with the obligation of the long-term care ombuds program or department staff to monitor the department's licensing, contract, and complaint investigation files for long-term care facilities.

7. The resident has the right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, and reprisal from a facility in exercising his or her rights, including the right to voice grievances about treatment furnished or not furnished. A facility that provides long-term care services shall not discriminate or retaliate in any manner against a resident, employee, or any other person on the basis or for the reason that such resident or any other person made a complaint to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, provided information, or otherwise cooperated with the investigation of such a complaint. Any attempt to discharge a resident against the resident's wishes, or any type of retaliatory treatment of a resident by whom or upon whose behalf a complaint substantiated by the department has been made to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, within one year of the filing of the complaint, raises a rebuttable presumption that such action was in retaliation for the filing of the complaint. "Retaliatory treatment" means, but is not limited to, monitoring a resident's phone, mail, or visits; involuntary seclusion or isolation; transferring a resident to a different room unless requested or based upon legitimate management reasons; withholding or threatening to withhold food or treatment unless authorized by a terminally ill resident or his or her representative pursuant to law; or persistently delaying responses to a resident's request for service or assistance. A facility that provides long-term care services shall not willfully interfere with the performance of official duties by a long-term care ombuds. The department shall sanction and may impose a civil penalty of not more than three thousand dollars for a violation of this subsection.

## 74.39A.100 - Chore services—Legislative finding, intent.
The legislature finds that it is desirable to provide a coordinated and comprehensive program of in-home services for certain citizens in order that such persons may remain in their own homes, obtain employment if possible, and maintain a closer contact with the community. Such a program will seek to prevent mental and psychological deterioration which our citizens might otherwise experience. The legislature intends that the services will be provided in a fashion which promotes independent living.

## 74.39A.110 - Chore services—Legislative policy and intent regarding available funds—Levels of service.
It is the intent of the legislature that chore services be provided to eligible persons within the limits of funds appropriated for that purpose. Therefore, the department shall provide services only to those persons identified as at risk of being placed in a long-term care facility in the absence of such services. The department shall not provide chore services to any individual who is eligible for, and whose needs can be met by another community service administered by the department. Chore services shall be provided to the extent necessary to maintain a safe and healthful living environment. It is the policy of the state to encourage the development of volunteer chore services in local communities as a means of meeting chore care service needs and directing financial resources. In determining eligibility for chore services, the department shall consider the following:

1. The kind of services needed;

2. The degree of service need, and the extent to which an individual is dependent upon such services to remain in his or her home or return to his or her home;

3. The availability of personal or community resources which may be utilized to meet the individual's need; and

4. Such other factors as the department considers necessary to insure service is provided only to those persons whose chore service needs cannot be met by relatives, friends, nonprofit organizations, other persons, or by other programs or resources.

In determining the level of services to be provided under this chapter, the client shall be assessed using an instrument designed by the department to determine the level of functional disability, the need for service and the person's risk of long-term care facility placement.

2. Chapter 41.56 RCW governs the collective bargaining relationship between the governor and individual providers, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter and except as follows:

   a. The only unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining under RCW 41.56.060 is a statewide unit of all individual providers;

   b. The showing of interest required to request an election under RCW 41.56.060 is ten percent of the unit, and any intervener seeking to appear on the ballot must make the same showing of interest;

   c. The mediation and interest arbitration provisions of RCW 41.56.430 through 41.56.470 and 41.56.480 apply, except that:

      i. With respect to commencement of negotiations between the governor and the bargaining representative of individual providers, negotiations shall be commenced by May 1st of any year prior to the year in which an existing collective bargaining agreement expires; and

      ii. The decision of the arbitrator is not binding on the legislature and, if the legislature does not approve the request for funds necessary to implement the compensation and fringe benefit provisions of the arbitrated collective bargaining agreement, is not binding on the authority or the state;

   d. Individual providers do not have the right to strike; and

   e. Individual providers who are related to, or family members of, consumers or prospective consumers are not, for that reason, exempt from this chapter or chapter 41.56 RCW.

3. Individual providers who are public employees solely for the purposes of collective bargaining under subsection (1) of this section are not, for that reason, employees of the state, its political subdivisions, or an area agency on aging for any purpose. Chapter 41.56 RCW applies only to the governance of the collective bargaining relationship between the employer and individual providers as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

4. Consumers and prospective consumers retain the right to select, hire, supervise the work of, and terminate any individual provider providing services to them. Consumers may elect to receive long-term in-home care services from individual providers who are not referred to them by the department or a department contractor.

5. Except as expressly limited in this section and RCW 74.39A.300, the wages, hours, and working conditions of individual providers are determined solely through collective bargaining as provided in this chapter. Except as described in RCW 74.39A.525, no agency or department of the state may establish policies or rules governing the wages or hours of individual providers.

6. Nothing in this section modifies:

   a. The department's authority to deny individual provider contracts to individuals who will not be able to meet the needs of a consumer or to terminate contracts of individual providers who are not adequately meeting the needs of a particular consumer; or

   b. The consumer's right to: (i) Assign hours to one or more individual providers consistent with the rules adopted under this chapter and his or her plan of care; and (ii) select, hire, terminate, supervise the work of, and determine the conditions of employment for each individual provider providing services to the consumer under this chapter.

7. At the request of the exclusive bargaining representative, the governor or the governor's designee appointed under chapter 41.80 RCW shall engage in collective bargaining, as defined in RCW 41.56.030(4), with the exclusive bargaining representative over the following subjects:

   a. Employer contributions to the training partnership for the costs of: (i) Meeting all training and peer mentoring requirements under this chapter; and (ii) other training intended to promote the career development of individual providers; and

   b. How the department's core responsibility affects hours of work for individual providers; this subsection shall not be interpreted to require collective bargaining over an individual consumer's plan of care.

8. The state, the department, the area agencies on aging, or their contractors under this chapter may not be held vicariously or jointly liable for the action or inaction of any individual provider or prospective individual provider, whether or not that individual provider or prospective individual provider was included on the referral registry or referred to a consumer or prospective consumer. The existence of a collective bargaining agreement, the placement of an individual provider on the referral registry, or the development or approval of a plan of care for a consumer who chooses to use the services of an individual provider and the provision of case management services to that consumer, by the department or an area agency on aging, does not constitute a special relationship with the consumer.

9. Nothing in this section affects the state's responsibility with respect to unemployment insurance for individual providers. However, individual providers are not to be considered, as a result of the state assuming this responsibility, employees of the state.

## 74.39A.300 - Funding process—Department-contracted individual providers.
If the department contracts with any individual providers for personal care services, funding will be determined in accordance with the following process:

1. Upon meeting the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, the governor must submit, as a part of the proposed biennial or supplemental operating budget submitted to the legislature under RCW 43.88.030, a request for funds necessary to administer in-home care programs under this chapter and to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270 or for legislation necessary to implement such agreement.

2. A request for funds necessary to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270 shall not be submitted by the governor to the legislature unless such request:

   a. Has been submitted to the director of financial management by October 1st prior to the legislative session at which the request is to be considered; and

   b. Has been certified by the director of financial management as being feasible financially for the state or reflects the binding decision of an arbitrator reached under RCW 74.39A.270(2)(c).

3. The legislature must approve or reject the submission of the request for funds as a whole. If the legislature rejects or fails to act on the submission, any such agreement will be reopened solely for the purpose of renegotiating the funds necessary to implement the agreement.

4. When any increase in individual provider wages or benefits is negotiated or agreed to, no increase in wages or benefits negotiated or agreed to under this chapter will take effect unless and until, before its implementation, the department has determined that the increase is consistent with federal law and federal financial participation in the provision of services under Title XIX of the federal social security act.

5. The governor shall periodically consult with the joint committee on employment relations established by RCW 41.80.010 regarding appropriations necessary to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of any collective bargaining agreement and, upon completion of negotiations, advise the committee on the elements of the agreement and on any legislation necessary to implement such agreement.

6. After the expiration date of any collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270, all of the terms and conditions specified in any such agreement remain in effect until the effective date of a subsequent agreement, not to exceed one year from the expiration date stated in the agreement, except as provided in RCW 74.39A.270.

7. If, after the compensation and benefit provisions of an agreement are approved by the legislature, a significant revenue shortfall occurs resulting in reduced appropriations, as declared by proclamation of the governor or by resolution of the legislature, both parties shall immediately enter into collective bargaining for a mutually agreed upon modification of the agreement.

This must be accomplished in each odd-numbered year within sixty days after adjournment sine die of the legislative session.

2. The per-quarter-hour amount shall be added to or subtracted from the statewide home care agency vendor rate and any increase shall be used exclusively for improving the wages and benefits of home care agency workers who provide direct care, and for paying any resulting change in required employer contributions or premiums.

3. When determining the per-quarter-hour amount, the department must include:

   a. The changes to wages, benefits, and compensation negotiated and funded each biennium, including but not limited to:

      i. Wages;

An adjustment, as determined by the department in its sole discretion, for cost of compensation for work time that may not be billed as service hours, such as travel time, that must be paid to direct service workers under wage and hour laws and any related employer tax contributions or premiums.

4. The portion of the vendor rate calculated for health care benefits, including but not limited to medical, dental, and vision benefits, may only be used for health benefits for home care agency workers who provide direct care.

5. When establishing the per-quarter-hour amount, the department must prevent duplicate accounting for the same cost.

Effective for July 1, 2006, and for each July 1st rate-setting period thereafter, the department shall determine the facility's medicaid occupancy percentage using the last six months' medicaid resident days from the preceding calendar year divided by the product of all its licensed assisted living facility beds irrespective of use, times calendar days for the six-month period. For the purposes of this section, medicaid resident days include those clients who are enrolled in a medicaid managed long-term care program, including but not limited to the program for all inclusive care and the medicaid integration project.

3. The medicaid occupancy percentage established beginning on July 1, 2006, and for each July 1st thereafter, shall be used to determine whether an assisted living facility qualifies for the capital add-on rate under this section. Those facilities that qualify for the capital add-on rate shall receive the capital add-on rate throughout the applicable fiscal year.

## 74.39A.390 - Personal care services—Glove access.
1. The legislature finds and declares that universal precautions are important health and safety protections for home care clients and workers who provide direct care for those clients. The use of personal protective equipment such as gloves is an established component of universal precautions and a key tool to protect against exposure to blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Most medicaid clients are eligible to receive gloves through their medicaid benefit, yet the majority of clients are not aware of or do not use this benefit and as a result do not have gloves available in the home for individual providers to use. The legislature intends to improve the availability and usage of gloves by individual providers as part of universal precautions by ensuring that medicaid clients access gloves through their medicaid benefit.

2. For medicaid clients, the department shall coordinate with the health care authority to assist clients receiving personal care services in accessing gloves as part of their health benefit for individual providers to use in the course of providing tasks where universal precautions are warranted. The assistance by the department and the health care authority must be designed to facilitate clients being able to access gloves on a monthly basis in a cost-effective and easy to access manner and must be consistent with requirements to receive federal matching funds under medicaid.

3. In cases where clients are not eligible to receive such gloves under medicaid, the department shall work with the health care authority to develop a methodology to ensure clients have access to gloves on a monthly basis in a cost-effective and easy to access manner.

4. The department shall submit a brief report with data on utilization of gloves by clients who are served by individual providers to the health care committees of the legislature by December 1, 2015.

## 74.39A.400 - Personal care services—Community first choice option.
1. The department of social and health services shall refinance medicaid personal care services under the community first choice option. Beginning July 1, 2014, the department shall seek stakeholder input on program and system design prior to the submission of a proposal to the center for medicaid and medicare [centers for medicare and medicaid] services. The community first choice option shall be designed in such a way to meet the federal minimum maintenance of effort requirements and all service requirements as specified in federal rule. Optional services may also be included in the benefit package. In the first full year of implementation, the increase in per capita cost of services directly resulting from meeting the federal requirements of the community first choice option, as well as the cost of new optional services, shall not exceed a three percent increase over the per capita costs of personal care services in the fiscal year prior to full implementation of the community first choice option. The three percent limit on new expenditures shall not apply to cost increases that are not the result of implementing the community first choice option, including case load growth, case mix changes, inflation, vendor rate changes, expenditures necessary to meet state and federal law requirements, and any adjustments made pursuant to collective bargaining. The community first choice option must be fully implemented no later than August 30, 2015.

2. The department shall use general fund—state savings from the refinance in this section to offset additional caseload, per capita cost increases, and staff resources necessary to implement the community first choice option. Any remaining general fund—state savings from the refinance shall be reserved for potential investments in home and community-based services for individuals with developmental disabilities or individuals with long-term care needs, including investments recommended by the joint legislative executive committee on aging and disability and the development and implementation council that the department must convene prior to submitting the proposed community first choice option to the centers for medicare and medicaid services. At a minimum, the final report to the legislature from the joint legislative executive committee on aging and disability must explore the cost and benefit of rate enhancements for providers of long-term services and supports, restoration of hours for in-home clients, additional investment in the family caregiver support program, and additional investment in the individual and family services program or other medicaid services to support individuals with developmental disabilities.

   a. The consumer directed employer program is a consumer directed program and must be operated in a manner consistent with federal medicaid requirements. The consumer directed employer is the legal employer of individual providers for administrative purposes.

   b. Under the consumer directed employer program, the consumer is the managing employer of individual providers and retains the primary right to select, dismiss, assign hours, and supervise the work of one or more individual providers, as long as the consumer's actions are consistent with the consumer's plan of care, this chapter, and state and federal law.

2. The department shall endeavor to select and contract with one consumer directed employer to be a medicaid provider that will coemploy individual providers. The department shall make every effort to select a single qualified vendor. In the event it is not possible to contract with a single vendor, the department is authorized to contract with up to two vendors. The department's activities to identify, select, and contract with a consumer directed employer are exempt from the requirements of chapter 39.26 RCW.

   a. When contracting with a consumer directed employer, the department should seek to contract with a vendor that demonstrates:

      i. A strong commitment to consumer choice, self-direction, and maximizing consumer autonomy and control over daily decisions; and

      ii. A commitment to recruiting and retaining a high quality and diverse workforce and working with a broad coalition of stakeholders in an effort to understand the changing needs of the workforce and consumer needs and preferences.

   b. Additional factors the department should consider in selecting a vendor include, but are not limited to, the vendor's:

      i. Ability to provide maximum support to consumers to focus on directing their own services through a model that recognizes that the provision of employer responsibility and human resource administration support is integral to successful self-directed home care programs;

      ii. Commitment to engage and work closely with consumers in design, implementation, and ongoing operations through an advisory board, focus group, or other methods as approved by the department;

      iii. Focus on workforce retention and creating incentives for qualified and trained providers to meet the growing needs of state long-term care consumers;

      iv. Ability to meet the state's interest in preventing or mitigating disruptions to consumer services;

      v. Ability to deliver high quality training, health care, and retirement, which may include participation in existing trusts that deliver those benefits;

      vi. Ability to comply with the terms and conditions of employment of individual providers at the time of the transition;

      vii. Commitment to involving its home care workforce in decision making;

      viii. Vision for including and enhancing home care workers as a valued member of the consumer's care team, as desired and authorized by the consumer and reflected in the consumer's plan of care; and

      ix. Ability to build and adapt technology tools that can enhance efficiency and provide better quality of services.

   c. In order to be qualified as a consumer directed employer, an entity must meet the requirements in: (i) Its contract with the department; (ii) the medicaid state plan; (iii) rules adopted under this chapter, if any; and (iv) this section.

   d. Any qualified and willing individual may apply to become an employee of a consumer directed employer and may work as an individual provider when selected by a consumer.

   e. A consumer directed employer that holds a contract with the department to provide medicaid services through the employment of individual providers is deemed to be a certified medicaid provider.

   f. A consumer directed employer is not a home care agency under chapter 70.127 RCW.

   g. A consumer directed employer does not need a separate licensure or certification category.

   h. A consumer directed employer that also provides home care services under chapter 70.127 RCW must demonstrate to the department's satisfaction that it operates the programs under separate business units, and that its business structures, policies, and procedures will prevent any conflicts of interest.

3. If the department selects and contracts with a consumer directed employer, the department shall determine when to terminate the department's contracts with individual providers.

   a. Until the department determines the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, the state shall continue to administer the individual provider program for the remaining contracted individual providers and to act as the public employer solely for the purpose of collective bargaining under RCW 74.39A.270 for those directly contracted individual providers.

   b. Once the department determines that the transition to the consumer directed employer is complete, the department may no longer contract with individual providers, unless there are not any contracted consumer directed employers available.

4. The department of labor and industries shall initially place individual providers employed by a consumer directed employer in the classification for the home care services and home care referral registry. After the department determines that the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, the department of labor and industries may, if necessary, adjust the classification and rate in accordance with chapter 51.16 RCW.

5. After the date on which the department enters into a contract with the consumer directed employer and determines the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, biennial funding in the next ensuing biennium for case management and social work shall be reduced by no more than: Two million nine hundred eight thousand dollars for area agencies on aging; one million three hundred sixty-one thousand dollars for home and community services; and one million two hundred eighty-nine thousand dollars for developmental disabilities.

   d. On each successive occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the order of voting members striking names from the list will continue to alternate between the order described in (b)(ii) and (c) of this subsection.

6. If an agreement on a proposed labor rate, an administrative rate, or both, is not reached by a majority of the voting members of the rate-setting board prior to July 1st, then:

   a. The labor rate shall be determined by the vote of the chair member, who was selected in accordance with subsections (2) and (5)(a) of this section; and

   b. The administrative rate shall be determined by the department.

7. After the rates have been determined in accordance with subsections (3) through (6) of this section, they shall be submitted to the director of the office of financial management by October 1st prior to the legislative session during which the requests are to be considered for review. If the director of the office of financial management certifies them as being feasible financially for the state, the governor shall include a request for funds necessary to implement the proposed rates as part of the governor's budget document submitted under RCW 43.88.030 and 43.88.060.

       i. Recognize changes to the department's required expenditures or the consumer directed employer's required costs associated with changes to tax rates, required employer contributions, mileage rate allowances, and utilization of overtime to comply with RCW 74.39A.525; or

       ii. Comply with a significant change in state or federal rule or law that would impact the consumer directed employer's ability to operate;

    b. Changes to the rates shall not exceed two percent of the combined labor and administrative rates; and

    c. Any increase to the rates is contingent on appropriation of adequate funds by the legislature.

13. For the purpose of this section:

    a. "Labor rate" is defined as that portion of the consumer directed employer's hourly rate that is to be used by the consumer directed employer to compensate its workers, including wages, benefits, and any associated taxes.

    b. "Administrative rate" is defined as that portion of the consumer directed employer's hourly rate that is to be used by the consumer directed employer to perform its administrative duties including losses for bad debt, compensation for business and occupation taxes on the labor and administrative rates, and all other costs associated with operating as the consumer directed employer.
