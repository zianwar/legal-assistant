## 36.65.020 - School districts to be retained as separate political subdivisions.

## 36.65.040 - Method of allocating state revenues.
The method of allocating state revenues shall not be modified for a period of one year from the date the initial officers of the city-county assume office. During the one-year period, state revenue shares shall be calculated as if the preexisting county, cities, and special purpose districts had continued as separate entities. However, distributions of the revenue to the consolidated entities shall be made to the city-county.

Subject to the requirements of RCW 41.56.100 and 41.58.070, if the city-county government includes a fire protection or law enforcement unit that was, prior to the formation of the city-county, governed by a state statute providing for binding arbitration in collective bargaining, then the entire fire protection or law enforcement unit of the city-county shall be governed by that statute.

## 36.65.060 - Public employee retirement or disability benefits not affected.
The formation of a city-county shall not have the effect of reducing, restricting, or limiting retirement or disability benefits of any person employed by or retired from a municipal corporation, or who had a vested right in any state or local retirement system, prior to the formation of the city-county.

\[ [1984 c 91 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c91.pdf?cite=1984%20c%2091%20§%206); \]
