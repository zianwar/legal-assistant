## 36.94.020 - Purpose—Powers.
The construction, operation, and maintenance of a system of sewerage and/or water is a county purpose. Subject to the provisions of this chapter, every county has the power, individually or in conjunction with another county or counties to adopt, provide for, accept, establish, condemn, purchase, construct, add to, operate, and maintain a system or systems of sanitary and storm sewers, including outfalls, interceptors, plans, and facilities and services necessary for sewerage treatment and disposal, and/or system or systems of water supply within all or a portion of the county. However, counties shall not have power to condemn sewerage and/or water systems of any municipal corporation or private utility.

Such county or counties shall have the authority to control, regulate, operate, and manage such system or systems and to provide funds therefor by general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, local improvement district bonds, utility local improvement district or local improvement district assessments, and in any other lawful fiscal manner. Rates or charges for on-site inspection and maintenance services may not be imposed under this chapter on the development, construction, or reconstruction of property.

Under this chapter, after July 1, 1998, any requirements for pumping the septic tank of an on-site sewage system should be based, among other things, on actual measurement of accumulation of sludge and scum by a trained inspector, trained owner's agent, or trained owner. Training must occur in a program approved by the state board of health or by a local health officer.

Before adopting on-site inspection and maintenance utility services, or incorporating residences into an on-site inspection and maintenance or sewer utility under this chapter, notification must be provided, prior to the applicable public hearing, to all residences within the proposed service area that have on-site systems permitted by the local health officer. The notice must clearly state that the residence is within the proposed service area and must provide information on estimated rates or charges that may be imposed for the service.

A county shall not provide on-site sewage system inspection, pumping services, or other maintenance or repair services under this section using county employees unless the on-site system is connected by a publicly owned collection system to the county's sewerage system, and the on-site system represents the first step in the sewage disposal process. Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of a state or local health officer to carry out their responsibilities under any other applicable law.

A county may, as part of a system of sewerage established under this chapter, provide for, finance, and operate any of the facilities and services and may exercise the powers expressly authorized for county stormwater, flood control, pollution prevention, and drainage services and activities under chapters 36.89, 86.12, 86.13, and 86.15 RCW. A county also may provide for, finance, and operate the facilities and services and may exercise any of the powers authorized for aquifer protection areas under chapter 36.36 RCW; for lake or beach management districts under chapter 36.61 RCW; for diking districts, and diking, drainage, and sewerage improvement districts under chapters 85.05, 85.08, 85.15, 85.16, and 85.18 RCW; and for shellfish protection districts under chapter 90.72 RCW. However, if a county by reference to any of those statutes assumes as part of its system of sewerage any powers granted to such areas or districts and not otherwise available to a county under this chapter, then (1) the procedures and restrictions applicable to those areas or districts apply to the county's exercise of those powers, and (2) the county may not simultaneously impose rates and charges under this chapter and under the statutes authorizing such areas or districts for substantially the same facilities and services, but must instead impose uniform rates and charges consistent with RCW 36.94.140. By agreement with such an area or district that is not part of a county's system of sewerage, a county may operate that area's or district's services or facilities, but a county may not dissolve any existing area or district except in accordance with any applicable provisions of the statute under which that area or district was created.

## 36.94.030 - Adoption of sewerage and/or water general plan as element of comprehensive plan.
Whenever the county legislative authority deems it advisable and necessary for the public health and welfare of the inhabitants of the county to establish, purchase, acquire, and construct a system of sewerage and/or water, or make any additions and betterments thereto, or extensions thereof, the board shall adopt a sewerage and/or water general plan for a system of sewerage and/or water for all or a portion of the county as deemed necessary by the board. If the county has adopted a comprehensive plan for a physical development of the county pursuant to chapter 36.70 RCW and/or chapter 35.63 RCW, then the sewerage and/or water general plan shall be adopted as an element of that comprehensive plan pursuant to the applicable statute.

\[ [1981 c 313 § 15](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c313.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20313%20§%2015); [1967 c 72 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c72.pdf?cite=1967%20c%2072%20§%203); \]

## 36.94.040 - Incorporation of provisions of comprehensive plan in general plan.
The sewerage and/or water general plan must incorporate the provisions of existing comprehensive plans relating to sewerage and water systems of cities, towns, municipalities, and private utilities, to the extent they have been implemented.

\[ [1990 1st ex.s. c 17 § 33](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990ex1c17.pdf?cite=1990%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2017%20§%2033); [1967 c 72 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c72.pdf?cite=1967%20c%2072%20§%204); \]

## 36.94.050 - Review committee—Composition—Submission of plan or amendment to.
Prior to the adoption of or amendment of the sewerage and/or water general plan, the county legislative authority (or authorities) shall submit the plan or amendment to a review committee. The review committee shall consist of:

1. A representative of each city with a population of ten thousand or more within or adjoining the area selected by the mayor thereof (if there are no such cities within the plan area, then one representative chosen by the mayor of the city with the largest population within the plan area);

2. One representative chosen at large by a majority vote of the executive officers of the other cities or towns within or adjoining the area;

3. A representative chosen by the executive officer or the chair of the board, as the case may be, of each of the other municipal corporations and private utilities serving one thousand or more sewer and/or water customers located within the area;

4. One representative chosen at large by a majority vote of the executive officers and chairs of the boards, as the case may be, of the other remaining municipal corporations within the area;

5. A representative of each county legislative authority within the planned area, selected by the chair of each board or county executive, as the case may be; and

6. In counties where there is a metropolitan municipal corporation operating a sewerage and/or water system in the area, the chair of its council or such person as the chair designates.

If the legislative authority rejects the plan pursuant to RCW 36.94.090, the review committee shall be deemed to be dissolved; otherwise the review committee shall continue in existence to review amendments to the plan. Vacancies on the committee shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment to that position.

Instead of a review committee for each plan area, the county legislative authority or authorities may create a review committee for the entire county or counties, and the review committee shall continue in existence until dissolved by the county legislative authority or authorities.

## 36.94.060 - Review committee—Chair, secretary—Rules—Quorum—Compensation of members.
The members of each review committee shall elect from its members a chair and a secretary. The committee shall determine its own rules and order of business and shall provide by resolution for the time and manner of its proceedings which shall be a public record. A majority of all the members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

Each member of the committee shall be compensated from the county current expense fund at the rate of twenty-five dollars per day, or a major portion thereof, for time actually devoted to the work of the committee in reviewing any proposed sewerage and/or water general plan or amendments to a plan. Each board of county commissioners shall provide such funds as shall be necessary to pay the compensation of the members and such other expenses as shall be reasonably necessary. Such payments shall be reimbursed to the counties advancing the funds from moneys acquired from the construction or operation of a sewerage and/or water system.

2. That the assessment has been paid.

If federal, local, or state funds become available for a local improvement after the assessment roll has been confirmed by the county legislative authority, the funds may be used to lower the assessments on a uniform basis. Any adjustments to the assessments because of the availability of federal or state funds may be made on the next annual payment.

Any funds received by the county which have been collected for the purpose of paying any bonded or other indebtedness of the municipal corporation shall be used for the purpose for which they were collected and for no other purpose until such indebtedness has been paid and retired or adequate provision has been made for such payment and retirement. No transfer of property as provided in *this amendatory act shall derogate from the claims or rights of the creditors of the municipal corporation or impair the ability of the municipal corporation to respond to its debts and obligations.

## 36.94.380 - Local improvement bonds—Local improvement guaranty fund—Payments—Assessments—Certificates of delinquency.
Every county adopting a water and/or sewerage general plan is hereby authorized to create a fund for the purpose of guaranteeing, to the extent of such fund, and in the manner hereinafter provided, the payment of all of its local improvement bonds issued, subsequent to May 19, 1981, to pay for any water or sewerage local improvement within its confines. Such fund shall be designated ". . . . . . County Local Improvement Guaranty Fund" and shall be established by resolution of the county legislative authority. For the purpose of maintaining such fund, every county, after the establishment thereof, shall at all times set aside and pay into such a fund such proportion of the monthly gross revenues of the water and/or sewerage system of such county as the legislative authority thereof may direct by resolution. This proportion may be varied from time to time as the county legislative authority deems expedient or necessary, except that under the existence of the conditions set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the proportion must be as therein specified.

1. Whenever any bonds of any local improvement district have been guaranteed under RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 and the guaranty fund does not have a cash balance equal to five percent of all bonds originally guaranteed under this chapter (excluding issues which have been retired in full), then five percent of the gross monthly revenues derived from all water and sewer users in the territory included in that local improvement district (but not necessarily from users in other parts of the county as a whole) may be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund. Whenever, under the requirements of this subsection, the cash balance accumulates so that it is equal to five percent of all bonds guaranteed, or to the full amount of all bonds guaranteed, outstanding and unpaid (which amount might be less than five percent of the original total guaranteed), then no further moneys need be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund so long as that condition continues.

2. Whenever any warrants issued against the guaranty fund, as provided in this section, remain outstanding and uncalled for lack of funds for six months from the date of issuance thereof; or whenever any coupons or bonds guaranteed under this chapter have been matured for six months and have not been redeemed either in cash or by issuance and delivery of warrants upon the guaranty fund, then five percent of the gross monthly revenues (or such portion thereof as the county legislative authority determines will be sufficient to retire those warrants or redeem those coupons or bonds in the ensuing six months) derived from all water and/or sewer users in the county shall be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund. Whenever under the requirements of this subsection all such warrants, coupons, or bonds have been redeemed, no further income need be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund under the requirements of this subsection until and unless other warrants remain outstanding and unpaid for six months or other coupons or bonds default.

3. For the purpose of complying with the requirements of setting aside and paying into the local improvement guaranty fund a proportion of the monthly gross revenues of the water supply and/or sewerage system of any county, that county shall bind and obligate itself to maintain and operate such system and further bind and obligate itself to establish, maintain, and collect such rates for water as will provide gross revenues sufficient to maintain and operate such systems and to make necessary provision for the local improvement guaranty fund as specified by this section, and the county shall alter its rates for water or sewer service from time to time and shall vary the same in different portions of its territory to comply with those requirements.

4. Whenever any coupon or bond guaranteed by RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 matures and there is not sufficient funds in the appropriate local improvement district bond redemption fund to pay the coupon or bond, then the county treasurer shall pay the coupon or bond from the local improvement guaranty fund of the county; if there is not sufficient funds in the guaranty fund to pay the coupon or bond, then it may be paid by issuance and delivery of a warrant upon the local improvement guaranty fund.

5. Whenever the cash balance in the local improvement guaranty fund is insufficient for the required purposes, warrants drawing interest of a rate fixed by the county legislative authority may be issued by the county auditor against the fund to meet any liability accrued against it and must be issued upon demand of the holders of any maturing coupons and/or bonds guaranteed by RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400, or to pay for any certificates of delinquency for delinquent installments of assessments as provided in subsection (6) of this section. Guaranty fund warrants shall be a first lien in their order of issuance upon the gross revenues set aside and paid into the guaranty fund.

6. Within twenty days after the date of delinquency of any annual installment of assessments levied for the purpose of paying the local improvement bonds of any county guaranteed under the provisions of this chapter, the county treasurer shall compile a statement of all installments delinquent, together with the amount of accrued interest and penalty appurtenant to each of those installments. Thereupon the county treasurer shall forthwith purchase certificates of delinquency for all such delinquent installments. Payment for all such certificates of delinquency shall be made from the local improvement guaranty fund, and if there is not sufficient moneys in the fund to pay for such certificates of delinquency, the county treasurer shall accept the local improvement guaranty fund warrants in payment therefor. All such certificates of delinquency shall be issued in the name of the local improvement guaranty fund, and all guaranty fund warrants issued in payment therefor shall be issued in the name of the appropriate local improvement district fund. Whenever any market is available and the county legislative authority so directs, the county treasurer shall sell any certificates of delinquency belonging to the local improvement guaranty fund, but any such sale may not be for less than face value thereof plus accrued interest from the date of issuance to date of sale.

Such certificates of delinquency, as above provided, shall be issued by the county treasurer, shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum, shall be in each instance for the face value of the delinquent installment, plus accrued interest to date of issuance of certificate of delinquency, plus a penalty of five percent of such face value, and shall set forth the:

   a. Description of the property assessed;

   b. Date the installment of the assessment became delinquent; and

   c. Name of the owner or reputed owner, if known.

Such certificates of delinquency may be redeemed by the owners of the property assessed at any time up to two years from the date of foreclosure of such certificate of delinquency.

If any certificate of delinquency is not redeemed by the second occurring first day of January subsequent to its issuance, the county treasurer shall then proceed to foreclose such certificate of delinquency in the manner specified for the foreclosure of the lien of local improvement assessments, pursuant to the laws applicable to cities or towns; and if no redemption is made within the succeeding two years the treasurer shall execute and deliver a deed conveying fee simple title to the property described in the foreclosed certificate of delinquency.

## 36.94.390 - Local improvement bonds—Local improvement guaranty fund—Subrogation—Interest—Purchase of real property at foreclosure sales.
Whenever there is paid out of a guaranty fund any sum on account of principal or interest upon the local improvement bond, or on account of purchase of certificates of delinquency, the county, as trustee for the fund, shall be subrogated to all rights of the holder of the bonds, or interest coupons, or delinquent assessment installments, so paid; and the proceeds thereof, or of the assessment or assessments underlying the same, shall become a part of the guaranty fund. There shall also be paid into each guaranty fund the interest received from the bank deposits of the fund, as well as any surplus remaining in the local improvement funds guaranteed under this chapter, after the payment of all outstanding bonds payable primarily out of such local improvement funds. As among the several issues of bonds guaranteed by the fund, no preference exists, but defaulted interest coupons and/or bonds shall be purchased out of the fund in the order of their presentation.

The legislative authority of every county operating under the provisions of RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 shall by resolution prescribe appropriate rules for the guaranty fund, not inconsistent with this chapter. So much of the money of a guaranty fund as is necessary and is not required for other purposes under the terms of RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 may, at the discretion of the county legislative authority, be used to purchase property at county tax foreclosure sales or from the county after foreclosure in cases where such property is subject to unpaid local improvement assessments securing bonds guaranteed under this chapter and such purchase is deemed necessary for the purpose of protecting the guaranty fund. In such cases the fund shall be subrogated to all rights of the county. After so acquiring title to real property, the county may lease or resell and convey the property in the manner that county property is authorized to be leased or resold and for such prices and on such terms as may be determined by resolution of the county legislative authority. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all proceeds resulting from such resales belong to and shall be paid into the guaranty fund.

The remedy of the holder or owner of a local improvement bond, in the case of nonpayment, is confined to the enforcement of the assessment and to the guaranty fund. A copy of the foregoing part of this section shall be plainly written, printed, or engraved on each local improvement bond guaranteed by RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400. The establishment of a local improvement guaranty fund by any county shall not be deemed at variance from any water and/or sewerage general plan or amendment thereto heretofore adopted by such county.

If any local improvement guaranty fund authorized under RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 at any time has a cash balance, and the obligations guaranteed thereby have all been paid off, then such balance shall be transferred to the water and/or sewer maintenance fund of the county.
