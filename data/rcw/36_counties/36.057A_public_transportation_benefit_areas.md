Such conference shall be for the purpose of evaluating the need for and the desirability of the creation of a public transportation benefit area within certain incorporated and unincorporated portions of the county to provide public transportation services within such area. In those counties where county officials believe the need for public transportation service extends across county boundaries so as to provide public transportation service in a metropolitan area, the county legislative bodies of two or more neighboring counties may elect to convene a multi-county conference. In addition, countywide conferences may be convened by resolution of the legislative bodies of two or more cities within the county, not to exceed one in any twelve-month period, or a petition signed by at least ten percent of the registered voters in the last general election of the city, county or city/county areas of a proposed benefit area. The chair of the conference shall be elected from the members at large.

## 36.57A.030 - Establishment or change in boundaries of public transportation benefit area—Hearing—Notice—Procedure—Authority of county to terminate public transportation benefit area.
Any conference which finds it desirable to establish a public transportation benefit area or change the boundaries of any existing public transportation benefit area shall fix a date for a public hearing thereon, or the legislative bodies of any two or more component cities or the county legislative body by resolution may require the public transportation improvement conference to fix a date for a public hearing thereon. Prior to the convening of the public hearing, the county governing body shall delineate the area of the county proposed to be included within the transportation benefit area, and shall furnish a copy of such delineation to each incorporated city within such area. Each city shall advise the county governing body, on a preliminary basis, of its desire to be included or excluded from the transportation benefit area by means of an ordinance adopted by the legislative body of that city. The county governing body shall cause the delineations to be revised to reflect the wishes of such incorporated cities. This delineation shall be considered by the conference at the public hearing for inclusion in the public transportation benefit area.

Notice of such hearing shall be published once a week for at least four consecutive weeks in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the area. The notice shall contain a description and map of the boundaries of the proposed public transportation benefit area and shall state the time and place of the hearing and the fact that any changes in the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area will be considered at such time and place. At such hearing or any continuation thereof, any interested person may appear and be heard on all matters relating to the effect of the formation of the proposed public transportation benefit area.

The conference may make such changes in the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area as they shall deem reasonable and proper, but may not delete any portion of the proposed area which will create an island of included or excluded lands, and may not delete a portion of any city. If the conference shall determine that any additional territory should be included in the public transportation benefit area, a second hearing shall be held and notice given in the same manner as for the original hearing. The conference may adjourn the hearing on the formation of a public transportation benefit area from time to time not exceeding thirty days in all.

Following the conclusion of such hearing the conference shall adopt a resolution fixing the boundaries of the proposed public transportation benefit area, declaring that the formation of the proposed public transportation benefit area will be conducive to the welfare and benefit of the persons and property therein.

Within thirty days of the adoption of such conference resolution, the county legislative authority of each county wherein a conference has established proposed boundaries of a public transportation benefit area, may by resolution, upon making a legislative finding that the proposed benefit area includes portions of the county which could not be reasonably expected to benefit from such benefit area or excludes portions of the county which could be reasonably expected to benefit from its creation, disapprove and terminate the establishment of such public transportation benefit area within such county.

## 36.57A.040 - Cities included or excluded—Boundaries—Only benefited areas included—One area per county, exception.
At the time of its formation no public transportation benefit area may include only a part of any city, and every city shall be either wholly included or wholly excluded from the boundaries of such area. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if subsequent to the formation of a public transportation benefit area additional area became or will become a part of a component city by annexation, merger, or otherwise, the additional area shall be included within the boundaries of the transportation benefit area and be subject to all taxes and other liabilities and obligations of the public transportation benefit area. The component city shall be required to notify the public transportation benefit area at the time the city has added the additional area. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provisions of law except as specifically provided in this section, if a city that is not a component city of the public transportation benefit area adds area to its boundaries that is within the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area, the area so added shall be deemed to be excluded from the public transportation benefit area: PROVIDED, That the public transportation benefit area shall be given notice of the city's intention to add such area. If a city extends its boundaries through annexation across a county boundary line and such extended boundaries include areas within the public transportation benefit area, then the entire area of the city within the county that is within the public transportation benefit area shall be included within the public transportation benefit area boundaries. Such area of the city in the public transportation benefit area shall be considered a component city of the public transportation benefit area corporation.

The boundaries of any public transportation benefit area shall follow school district lines or election precinct lines, as far as practicable. Only such areas shall be included which the conference determines could reasonably benefit from the provision of public transportation services. Except as provided in RCW 36.57A.140(2), only one public transportation benefit area may be created in any county.

## 36.57A.050 - Governing body—Selection, qualification, number of members—Travel expenses, compensation.
Within sixty days of the establishment of the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area the members of the county legislative authority and the elected representative of each city within the area shall provide for the selection of the governing body of such area, the public transportation benefit area authority, which shall consist of elected officials selected by and serving at the pleasure of the governing bodies of component cities within the area and the county legislative authority of each county within the area. The members of the governing body of the public transportation benefit area, if the population of the county in which the public transportation benefit area is located is more than four hundred thousand and the county does not also contain a city with a population of seventy-five thousand or more operating a transit system pursuant to chapter 35.95 RCW, must be selected to assure proportional representation, based on population, of each of the component cities located within the public transportation benefit area and the unincorporated areas of the county located within the public transportation benefit area, to the extent possible within the restrictions placed on the size of the governing body of a public transportation benefit area. If necessary to assure such proportional representation, multiple cities may be represented by a single elected official from one of the cities. A majority of the governing board may not be selected to represent a single component city. If at the time a public transportation benefit area authority assumes the public transportation functions previously provided under the interlocal cooperation act (chapter 39.34 RCW) there are citizen positions on the governing board of the transit system, those positions may be retained as positions on the governing board of the public transportation benefit area authority.

Within such sixty-day period, any city may by resolution of its legislative body withdraw from participation in the public transportation benefit area. The county legislative authority and each city remaining in the public transportation benefit area may disapprove and prevent the establishment of any governing body of a public transportation benefit area if the composition thereof does not meet its approval.

In no case shall the governing body of a single county public transportation benefit area be greater than nine voting members and in the case of a multicounty area, fifteen voting members. Those cities within the public transportation benefit area and excluded from direct membership on the authority are hereby authorized to designate a member of the authority who shall be entitled to represent the interests of such city which is excluded from direct membership on the authority. The legislative body of such city shall notify the authority as to the determination of its authorized representative on the authority.

There is one nonvoting member of the public transportation benefit area authority. The nonvoting member is recommended by the labor organization representing the public transportation employees within the local public transportation system. If the public transportation employees are represented by more than one labor organization, all such labor organizations shall select the nonvoting member by majority vote. The nonvoting member shall comply with all governing bylaws and policies of the authority. The chair or cochairs of the authority shall exclude the nonvoting member from attending any executive session held for the purpose of discussing negotiations with labor organizations. The chair or cochairs may exclude the nonvoting member from attending any other executive session. The requirement that a nonvoting member be appointed to the governing body of a public transportation benefit area authority does not apply to an authority that has no employees represented by a labor union.

Each member of the authority is eligible to be reimbursed for travel expenses in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060 and to receive compensation, as set by the authority, in an amount not to exceed forty-four dollars for each day during which the member attends official meetings of the authority or performs prescribed duties approved by the chair of the authority. Except that the authority may, by resolution, increase the payment of per diem compensation to each member from forty-four dollars up to ninety dollars per day or portion of a day for actual attendance at board meetings or for performance of other official services or duties on behalf of the authority. In no event may a member be compensated in any year for more than seventy-five days, except the chair who may be paid compensation for not more than one hundred days: PROVIDED, That compensation shall not be paid to an elected official or employee of federal, state, or local government who is receiving regular full-time compensation from such government for attending meetings and performing prescribed duties of the authority.

The dollar thresholds established in this section must be adjusted for inflation by the office of financial management every five years, beginning January 1, 2024, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. "Consumer price index" means, for any calendar year, that year's annual average consumer price index, for Washington state, for wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the bureau of labor and statistics, United States department of labor. If the bureau of labor and statistics develops more than one consumer price index for areas within the state, the index covering the greatest number of people, covering areas exclusively within the boundaries of the state, and including all items shall be used for the adjustments for inflation in this section. The office of financial management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the office of the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect.

A person holding office as commissioner for two or more special purpose districts shall receive only that per diem compensation authorized for one of his or her commissioner positions as compensation for attending an official meeting or conducting official services or duties while representing more than one of his or her districts. However, such commissioner may receive additional per diem compensation if approved by resolution of all boards of the affected commissions.

## 36.57A.055 - Governing body—Periodic review of composition.
After a public transportation benefit area has been in existence for four years, members of the county legislative authority and the elected representative of each city within the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area shall review the composition of the governing body of the benefit area and change the composition of the governing body if the change is deemed appropriate. When determining if a change to the composition of the governing body is appropriate, the proportional representation requirements of RCW 36.57A.050 must be taken into consideration if the population of the county in which the public transportation benefit area is located is more than four hundred thousand and the county does not also contain a city with a population of seventy-five thousand or more operating a transit system pursuant to chapter 35.95 RCW, and the composition of the governing body must be changed if necessary to meet this requirement. The review shall be at a meeting of the designated representatives of the component county and cities, and the majority of those present shall constitute a quorum at such meeting. Twenty days notice of the meeting shall be given by the chief administrative officer of the public transportation benefit area authority. After the initial review, a review shall be held every four years.

If an area having a population greater than fifteen percent, or areas with a combined population of greater than twenty-five percent of the population of the existing public transportation benefit area as constituted at the last review meeting, annex to the public transportation benefit area, or if an area is added under RCW 36.57A.140(2), the representatives of the component county and cities shall meet within ninety days to review and change the composition of the governing body, if the change is deemed appropriate. This meeting is in addition to the regular four-year review meeting and shall be conducted pursuant to the same notice requirement and quorum provisions of the regular review.

## 36.57A.060 - Comprehensive plan—Development—Elements.
The public transportation benefit area authority authorized pursuant to RCW 36.57A.050 shall develop a comprehensive transit plan for the area. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to the following elements:

1. The levels of transit service that can be reasonably provided for various portions of the benefit area.

2. The funding requirements, including local tax sources, state and federal funds, necessary to provide various levels of service within the area.

3. The impact of such a transportation program on other transit systems operating within that county or adjacent counties.

4. The future enlargement of the benefit area or the consolidation of such benefit area with other transit systems.

## 36.57A.070 - Comprehensive plan—Review.
The comprehensive transit plan adopted by the authority shall be reviewed by the state department of transportation to determine:

1. The completeness of service to be offered and the economic viability of the transit system proposed in such comprehensive transit plan;

2. Whether such plan integrates the proposed transportation system with existing transportation modes and systems that serve the benefit area;

3. Whether such plan coordinates that area's system and service with nearby public transportation systems;

4. Whether such plan is eligible for matching state or federal funds.

## 36.57A.090 - Additional powers—Acquisition of existing system.
A public transportation benefit area authority shall have the following powers in addition to the general powers granted by this chapter:

1. To prepare, adopt, and carry out a general comprehensive plan for public transportation service which will best serve the residents of the public transportation benefit area and to amend said plan from time to time to meet changed conditions and requirements.

2. To acquire by purchase, condemnation, gift, or grant and to lease, construct, add to, improve, replace, repair, maintain, operate, and regulate the use of transportation facilities and properties within or without the public transportation benefit area or the state, including systems of surface, underground, or overhead railways, tramways, buses, or any other means of local transportation except taxis, and including escalators, moving sidewalks, or other people-moving systems, passenger terminal and parking facilities and properties, and such other facilities and properties as may be necessary for passenger and vehicular access to and from such people-moving systems, terminal and parking facilities and properties, together with all lands, rights-of-way, property, equipment, and accessories necessary for such systems and facilities. Public transportation facilities and properties which are owned by any city may be acquired or used by the public transportation benefit area authority only with the consent of the city council of the city owning such facilities. Cities are hereby authorized to convey or lease such facilities to a public transportation benefit area authority or to contract for their joint use on such terms as may be fixed by agreement between the city council of such city and the public transportation benefit area authority, without submitting the matter to the voters of such city.

3. To fix rates, tolls, fares, and charges for the use of such facilities and to establish various routes and classes of service. Fares or charges may be adjusted or eliminated for any distinguishable class of users including, but not limited to, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and students.

In the event any person holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Washington utilities and transportation commission under RCW 81.68.040 has operated under such certificate for a continuous period of one year prior to the date of certification and is offering service within the public transportation benefit area on the date of the certification by the county canvassing board that a majority of votes cast authorize a tax to be levied and collected by the public transportation benefit area authority, such authority may by purchase or condemnation acquire at the fair market value, from the person holding the existing certificate for providing the services, that portion of the operating authority and equipment representing the services within the area of public operation. The person holding such existing certificate may require the public transportation benefit area authority to initiate such purchase of those assets of such person, existing as of the date of the county canvassing board certification, within sixty days after the date of such certification.

An agreement may be entered into between the public transportation benefit area authority and any person or corporation legally operating a local public passenger transportation service, including passenger-only ferry service, wholly within or partly within and partly without the public transportation benefit area and on said effective date under which such person or corporation may continue to operate such service or any part thereof for such time and upon such terms and conditions as provided in such agreement. Such agreement shall provide for a periodic review of the terms and conditions contained therein. Where any such local public passenger transportation service, including passenger-only ferry service, will be required to cease to operate within the public transportation benefit area, the public transportation benefit area authority may agree with the owner of such service to purchase the assets used in providing such service, or if no agreement can be reached, the public transportation benefit area authority shall condemn such assets in the manner and by the same procedure as is or may be provided by law for the condemnation of other properties for cities of the first class, except insofar as such laws may be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.

Wherever a privately owned public carrier operates wholly or partly within a public transportation benefit area, the Washington utilities and transportation commission shall continue to exercise jurisdiction over such operation as provided by law.

Such a treasurer shall possess all of the powers, responsibilities, and duties the county treasurer possesses for a public transportation benefit area authority related to investing surplus authority funds. The authority may (and if the treasurer is not a county treasurer, it shall) require a bond with a surety company authorized to do business in the state of Washington in an amount and under the terms and conditions the authority, by resolution, from time to time finds will protect the authority against loss. The premium on any such bond shall be paid by the authority.

All authority funds shall be paid to the treasurer and shall be disbursed by the treasurer only on warrants issued by the county auditor, upon orders or vouchers approved by the authority. However, the authority may, by resolution, designate some person having experience in financial or fiscal matters, other than the county auditor, as the auditor of the authority. Such an auditor shall possess all of the powers, responsibilities, and duties that the county auditor possesses for a public transportation benefit area authority related to creating and maintaining funds, issuing warrants, and maintaining a record of receipts and disbursements.

The treasurer shall establish a "transportation fund," into which shall be paid all authority funds, and the treasurer shall maintain such special accounts as may be created by the authority into which shall be placed all money as the authority may, by resolution, direct.

If the treasurer of the authority is a treasurer of the county, all authority funds shall be deposited with the county depositary under the same restrictions, contracts, and security as provided for county depositaries. If the treasurer of the authority is some other person, all funds shall be deposited in such bank or banks authorized to do business in this state that have qualified for insured deposits under any federal deposit insurance act as the authority, by resolution, shall designate.

An authority may provide and require a reasonable bond of any other person handling moneys or securities of the authority, but the authority shall pay the premium on the bond.

The county or counties and each city or town which is included in the authority shall contribute such sums towards the expense for maintaining and operating the public transportation system as shall be agreed upon between them.

A passenger-only ferry service district constitutes a body corporate and possesses all the usual powers of a corporation for public purposes as well as all other powers that may be conferred by statute including, but not limited to, the authority to hire employees, staff, and services, to enter into contracts, to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property, and to sue and be sued. Public works contract limits applicable to the public transportation benefit area that established the passenger-only ferry service district apply to the district. For purposes of this section, "passenger-only ferry service district" means a quasi-municipal corporation and independent taxing authority within the meaning of Article VII, section 1 of the state Constitution, and a taxing district within the meaning of Article VII, section 2 of the state Constitution, created by the legislative body of a public transportation benefit area.

4. Before a passenger-only ferry service district may provide passenger-only ferry service, it must develop a passenger-only ferry investment plan, including elements: To operate or contract for the operation of passenger-only ferry services; to purchase, lease, or rent ferry vessels and dock facilities for the provision of transit service; and to identify other activities necessary to implement the plan. The plan must set forth terminal locations to be served, projected costs of providing services, and revenues to be generated from tolls, locally collected tax revenues, and other revenue sources. The plan must ensure that services provided under the plan are for the benefit of the residents of the passenger-only ferry service district. The passenger-only ferry service district may use any of its powers to carry out this purpose, unless otherwise prohibited by law. In addition, the passenger-only ferry service district may enter into: Contracts and agreements to operate passenger-only ferry service; public-private partnerships; and design-build, general contractor/construction management, or other alternative procurement processes substantially consistent with chapter 39.10 RCW.

5. A passenger-only ferry service district may be dissolved by a majority vote of the governing body when all obligations under any general obligation bonds issued by the passenger-only ferry service district have been discharged and any other contractual obligations of the passenger-only ferry service district have either been discharged or assumed by another governmental entity.

2. General obligation bonds with a maturity in excess of twenty-five years may not be issued. The governing body of the passenger-only ferry service district must by resolution determine for each general obligation bond issue the amount, date, terms, conditions, denominations, maximum fixed or variable interest rate or rates, maturity or maturities, redemption rights, registration privileges, manner of execution, manner of sale, callable provisions, if any, covenants, and form, including registration as to principal and interest, registration as to principal only, or bearer. Registration may include, but not be limited to: (a) A book entry system of recording the ownership of a bond whether or not physical bonds are issued, or (b) recording the ownership of a bond together with the requirement that the transfer of ownership may only be effected by the surrender of the old bond and either the reissuance of the old bond or the issuance of a new bond to the new owner. Facsimile signatures may be used on the bonds and any coupons. Refunding general obligation bonds may be issued in the same manner as general obligation bonds are issued.

3. Whenever general obligation bonds are issued to fund specific projects or enterprises that generate revenues, charges, user fees, or special assessments, the passenger-only ferry service district may specifically pledge all or a portion of the revenues, charges, user fees, or special assessments to refund the general obligation bonds. The passenger-only ferry service district may also pledge any other revenues that may be available to the district.

4. In addition to general obligation bonds, a passenger-only ferry service district may issue revenue bonds to be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.
