## 36.96.020 - Notice of inactive special purpose districts by county auditor.
On or before June 1st of 1980, and on or before June 1st of every year thereafter, each county auditor shall search available records and notify the county legislative authority if any special purpose districts located wholly or partially within the county appear to be inactive. If the territory of any special purpose district is located within more than one county, the legislative authorities of all other counties within whose boundaries such a special purpose district lies shall also be notified by the county auditor. However, the authority to dissolve such a special purpose district as provided by this chapter shall rest solely with the legislative authority of the county which contains the greatest geographic portion of such special purpose district.

Upon receipt of notice from the county auditor as provided in RCW 36.96.020, the county legislative authority within whose boundaries all or the greatest portion of such special purpose district lies shall hold one or more public hearings on or before September 1st of the same year to determine whether or not such special purpose district or districts meet any of the criteria for being "inactive" as provided in RCW 36.96.010. In addition, at any time a county legislative authority may hold hearings on the dissolution of any special purpose district that appears to meet the criteria of being "inactive" and dissolve such a district pursuant to the proceedings provided for in RCW 36.96.030 through 36.96.080.

2. Notice of such public hearings shall be given by publication at least once each week for not less than three successive weeks in a newspaper that is in general circulation within the boundaries of the special purpose district or districts. Notice of such hearings shall also be mailed to each member of the governing authority of such special purpose districts, if such members are known, and to all persons known to have claims against any of the special purpose districts. Notice of such public hearings shall be posted in at least three conspicuous places within the boundaries of each special purpose district that is a subject of such hearings. Whenever a county legislative authority that is conducting such a public hearing on the dissolution of one or more of a particular kind of special purpose district is aware of the existence of an association of such special purpose districts, it shall also mail notice of the hearing to the association. In addition, whenever a special purpose district that lies in more than one county is a subject of such a public hearing, notice shall also be mailed to the legislative authorities of all other counties within whose boundaries the special purpose district lies. All notices shall state the purpose, time, and place of such hearings, and that all interested persons may appear and be heard.

\[ [2020 c 179 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2588-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20179%20§%203); [1979 ex.s. c 5 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c5.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%205%20§%203); \]

## 36.96.040 - Dissolution of inactive special purpose district by county legislative authority—Written findings.
After such hearings, the county legislative authority shall make written findings whether each of the special purpose districts that was a subject of the hearings meets each of the criteria of being "inactive." Whenever a special purpose district other than a public utility district has been found to meet a criterion of being inactive, or a public utility district has been found to meet both criteria of being inactive, the county legislative authority shall adopt an ordinance dissolving the special purpose district if it also makes additional written findings detailing why it is in the public interest that the special purpose district be dissolved, and shall provide a copy of the ordinance to the county treasurer. Except for the purpose of winding up its affairs as provided by this chapter, a special purpose district that is so dissolved shall cease to exist and the authority and obligation to carry out the purposes for which it was created shall cease thirty-one days after adoption of the dissolution ordinance.

\[ [2001 c 299 § 12](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5638-S.SL.pdf?cite=2001%20c%20299%20§%2012); [1979 ex.s. c 5 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c5.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%205%20§%204); \]

## 36.96.050 - Application for writ of prohibition or mandamus by interested party—Procedure.
The action of the county legislative authority dissolving a special purpose district pursuant to RCW 36.96.040 shall be final and conclusive unless within thirty days of the adoption of the ordinance an interested party makes application to a court of competent jurisdiction for a writ of prohibition or writ of mandamus. At the hearing upon such a writ, the applicant shall have the full burden of demonstrating that the particular special purpose district, other than a public utility district, does not meet either of the criteria of being inactive or that it is not in the public interest that the special purpose district be dissolved: PROVIDED, That where the particular special purpose district subject to the dissolution proceedings is a public utility district, the applicant shall have the full burden of demonstrating that the public utility district either does not meet both the criteria of being inactive or that it is not in the public interest to dissolve the public utility district.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 5 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c5.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%205%20§%205); \]

## 36.96.060 - Dissolution of inactive special purpose district by county legislative authority—Powers and duties.
For the sole and exclusive purpose of winding up the affairs of a dissolved special purpose district, the county legislative authority, acting as a board of trustees, shall have the same powers and duties as the governing authority of the dissolved special purpose district including the following:

1. To exchange, sell, or otherwise dispose of all property, real and personal, of the dissolved special purpose district; and

2. To settle all obligations of such special purpose district. Such powers and duties shall commence upon the effective date of dissolution and shall continue thereafter until such time as the affairs of the dissolved special purpose district have been completely wound up.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 5 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c5.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%205%20§%206); \]

## 36.96.070 - Dissolved special purpose district—Disposition of property.
Any moneys or funds of the dissolved special purpose district and any moneys or funds received by the board of trustees from the sale or other disposition of any property of the dissolved special purpose district shall be used, to the extent necessary, for the payment or settlement of any outstanding obligations of the dissolved special purpose district. Any remaining moneys or funds shall be used to pay the county legislative authority for all costs and expenses incurred in the dissolution and liquidation of the dissolved special purpose district. Thereafter, any remaining moneys, funds, or property shall become that of the county in which the dissolved special purpose district was located. However, if the territory of the dissolved special purpose district was located within more than one county, the remaining moneys, funds, and personal property shall be apportioned and distributed to each county in the proportion that the geographical area of the dissolved special purpose district within the county bears to the total geographical area of the dissolved special purpose district, and any remaining real property or improvements to real property shall be transferred to the county within whose boundaries it lies. A county to which real property or improvements to real property are transferred under this section may, but does not have an obligation to, use the property or improvements for the purposes for which the dissolved special purpose district used the property or improvements and the county does not assume the obligations or liabilities of the dissolved special purpose district as a result of the transfer unless the county expressly assumes such obligations or liabilities through the adoption of a resolution.

## 36.96.080 - Dissolved special purpose district—Satisfaction of outstanding obligations.
If the proceeds from the sale of any property of the special district together with any moneys or funds of the special purpose district are insufficient to satisfy the outstanding obligations of the special purpose district, the county legislative authority, acting as a board of trustees, shall exercise any and all powers conferred upon it to satisfy such outstanding obligations: PROVIDED, That in no case shall the board of trustees be obligated to satisfy such outstanding obligations from county moneys, funds, or other sources of revenue unless it would have been so obligated before initiation of the dissolution proceedings under this chapter.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 5 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c5.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%205%20§%208); \]
