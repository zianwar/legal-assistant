3. After the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs has implemented an electronic jail booking system as described in subsection (1) of this section, city or county jails, or law enforcement agencies that operate electronic jail booking systems, but choose not to accept state or federal money to implement or reconfigure electronic jail booking systems, shall electronically forward jail booking information to the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs.

      ii. Descriptive and personal information about each offender booked into a city or county jail. At a minimum, this information shall contain the offender's name, vital statistics, address, and mugshot;

      iii. Information about the offender while in jail, which could be used to protect criminal justice officials that have future contact with the offender, such as medical conditions, acts of violence, and other behavior problems;

      iv. Statistical data indicating the current capacity of each jail and the quantity and category of offenses charged;

      v. The ability to communicate directly and immediately with the city and county jails and other criminal justice entities; and

      vi. The date and time that an offender was released or transferred from a local jail;

   b. Develop and amend as needed operational standards for city and county jail booking systems, which at a minimum shall include the type of information collected and transmitted, and the technical requirements needed for the city and county jail booking system to communicate with the statewide jail booking and reporting system;

         A.  Is transferred or assigned to another facility;

         B.  Is transferred to the custody of another agency outside the state;

         C.  Is given a different security classification;

         E.  Is discharged;

         F.  Has escaped; or

         G.  Has been served with a protective order that was requested by the victim;

      ii. Automatically notify a registered victim via the victim's choice of telephone, letter, or email when an offender has:

          A.  An upcoming court event where the victim is entitled to be present, if the court information is made available to the statewide automated victim information and notification system administrator at the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs;

          B.  An upcoming parole, pardon, or community supervision hearing; or

          C.  A change in the offender's parole, probation, or community supervision status including:

              I. A change in the offender's supervision status; or

              II. A change in the offender's address;

      iii. Automatically notify a registered victim via the victim's choice of telephone, letter, or email when a sex offender has:

           A.  Updated his or her profile information with the state sex offender registry; or

           B.  Become noncompliant with the state sex offender registry;

      iv. Permit a registered victim to receive the most recent status report for an offender in any Washington state city and county jail, department of corrections, or sex offender registry by calling the statewide automated victim information and notification system on a toll-free telephone number or by accessing the statewide automated victim information and notification system via a public website. All registered victims calling the statewide automated victim information and notification system will be given the option to have live operator assistance to help use the program on a twenty-four hour, three hundred sixty-five day per year basis;

      v. Permit a crime victim to register, or registered victim to update, the victim's registration information for the statewide automated victim information and notification system by calling a toll-free telephone number or by accessing a public website; and

      vi. Ensure that the offender information contained within the statewide automated victim information and notification system is updated frequently to timely notify a crime victim that an offender has been released or discharged or has escaped. However, the failure of the statewide automated victim information and notification system to provide notice to the victim does not establish a separate cause of action by the victim against state officials, local officials, law enforcement officers, or any related correctional authorities.

   b. Participation in the statewide automated victim information and notification program satisfies any obligation to notify the crime victim of an offender's custody status and the status of the offender's upcoming court events so long as:

      i. Information making offender and case data available is provided on a timely basis to the statewide automated victim information and notification program; and

      ii. Information a victim submits to register and participate in the victim notification system is only used for the sole purpose of victim notification.

   c. Automated victim information and notification systems in existence and operational as of July 22, 2007, shall not be required to participate in the statewide system.

6. When funded, the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs shall implement and operate an electronic statewide unified sex offender notification and registration program. Information submitted to the program by a person for the purpose of receiving notification regarding a registered sex offender, including the person's name, residential address, and email address, are exempt from public inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW.

7. An appointed or elected official, public employee, or public agency as defined in RCW 4.24.470, or combination of units of government and its employees, as provided in RCW 36.28A.010, are immune from civil liability for damages for any release of information or the failure to release information related to the statewide automated victim information and notification system, the electronic statewide unified sex offender notification and registration program, and the jail booking and reporting system as described in this section, so long as the release was without gross negligence. The immunity provided under this subsection applies to the release of relevant and necessary information to other public officials, public employees, or public agencies, and to the general public.
