## 36.60.010 - Establishment of district—Boundaries—Powers.
Subject to RCW 36.60.020, the legislative authority of a county may establish one or more county rail districts within the county for the purpose of providing and funding improved rail freight or passenger service, or both. The boundaries of county rail districts shall be drawn to include contiguous property in an area from which agricultural or other goods could be shipped by the rail service provided. The district shall not include property outside this area which does not, or, in the judgment of the county legislative authority, is not expected to produce goods which can be shipped by rail, or property substantially devoted to fruit crops or producing goods that are shipped in a direction away from the district. A county rail district is a quasi municipal corporation, an independent taxing "authority" within the meaning of Article VII, section 1 of the state Constitution, and a "taxing district" within the meaning of Article VII, section 2 of the state Constitution.

A county rail district shall constitute a body corporate and shall possess all the usual powers of a corporation for public purposes as well as all other powers that may now or hereafter be specifically conferred by statute, including, but not limited to, the authority to hire employees, staff, and services, to enter into contracts, to accept and expend or use gifts, grants, and donations, and to sue and be sued.

The county legislative authority shall be the governing body of a county rail district. The county treasurer shall act as the ex officio treasurer of the county rail district. The electors of a district are all registered voters residing within the district.

This authority and that provided in RCW 36.60.030 may only be exercised outside the boundaries of the county rail district if such extraterritorial rail services, equipment, or facilities are found, by resolution of the county legislative authority exercising such authority, to be reasonably necessary to link the rail services, equipment, and facilities within the rail district to an interstate railroad system; however, if such extraterritorial rail services, equipment, or facilities are in or are to be located in one or more other counties, the legislative authority of such other county must consent by resolution to the proposed plan of the originating county which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

A county legislative authority proposing to establish a county rail district, or to modify the boundaries of an existing county rail district, or to dissolve an existing county rail district, shall conduct a hearing at the time and place specified in a notice published at least once, not less than ten days prior to the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation within the proposed county rail district. This notice shall be in addition to any other notice required by law to be published. Additional notice of the hearing may be given by mail, posting within the proposed county rail district, or in any manner the county legislative authority deems necessary to notify affected persons.

2. Following the hearing held under subsection (1) of this section, the county legislative authority may adopt a resolution providing for the submission of a proposal to establish a county rail district, modify the boundaries of an existing county rail district, or dissolve an existing county rail district, if the county legislative authority finds the proposal to be in the public interest. The resolution shall contain the boundaries of the district if applicable.

A proposition to create a county rail district, modify the boundaries of an existing county rail district, or dissolve an existing rail district shall be submitted to the affected voters at the next general election held sixty or more days after the adoption of the resolution providing for the submittal by the county legislative authority. The resolution shall establish the boundaries of the district and include a finding that the creation of the district is in the public interest and that the area included within the district can reasonably be expected to benefit from its creation. No portion of a city may be included in such a district unless the entire city is included.

The district shall be created upon approval of the proposition by simple majority vote. The ballot proposition submitted to the voters shall be in substantially the following form:

The governing body shall consider the cost of operation and maintenance of the public improvement, project, facility, or additions funded by the revenue bonds and shall not place into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues than it thinks will be available after maintenance and operation expenses have been paid and after the payment of revenue previously pledged. The governing body may also provide that revenue bonds payable from the same source or sources of revenue may later be issued on parity with any revenue bonds issued and sold.

3. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section shall not be an indebtedness of the county rail district issuing the bonds, and the interest and principal on the bonds shall only be payable from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The owner of a revenue bond or any interest coupon issued pursuant to this section shall not have any claim against the county rail district arising from the bond or coupon except for payment from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140.
