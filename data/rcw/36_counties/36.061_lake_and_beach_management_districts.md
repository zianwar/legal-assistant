## 36.61.010 - Findings—Intent—Purpose.
1. The legislature finds that the environmental, recreational, and aesthetic values of many of the state's lakes are threatened by eutrophication and other deterioration and that existing governmental authorities are unable to adequately improve and maintain the quality of the state's lakes.

2. The legislature intends that an ecosystem-based beach management approach should be used to help promote the health of aquatic ecosystems and that such a management approach be undertaken in a manner that retains ecosystem values within the state. This management approach should use long-term strategies that focus on reducing nutrient inputs from human activities affecting the aquatic ecosystem, such as decreasing nutrients into stormwater sewers, decreasing fertilizer application, promoting the proper disposal of pet waste, promoting the use of vegetative borders, promoting the reduction of nutrients from on-site septic systems where appropriate, and protecting riparian areas. Organic debris, including vegetation, driftwood, seaweed, kelp, and organisms, are extremely important to beach ecosystems.

3. The legislature further finds that it is in the public interest to promote the conservation and stewardship of shorelines and upland properties adjoining lakes and beaches in order to: (a) Conserve natural or scenic resources; (b) protect riparian habitats and water quality; (c) promote conservation of soils, wetlands, shorelines, or tidal marshes; (d) enhance the value of lakes or beaches to the public as well as the benefit of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries, or other open space; (e) enhance recreation opportunities; (f) preserve historic sites; and (g) protect visual quality along highway, road, street, trail, recreational, and other corridors or scenic vistas.

4. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a governmental mechanism by which property owners can embark on a program of lake or beach improvement and maintenance for their and the general public's benefit, health, and welfare. Public property, including state property, shall be considered the same as private property in this chapter, except liens for special assessments and liens for rates and charges shall not extend to public property. Lake bottom property and marine property below the line of the ordinary high water mark shall not be considered to be benefited, shall not be subject to special assessments or rates and charges, and shall not receive voting rights under this chapter.

## 36.61.020 - Creation of district—Special assessments or rates and charges.
1. Any county may create lake or beach management districts to finance: (a) The improvement and maintenance of lakes or beaches located within or partially within the boundaries of the county; and (b) the acquisition of real property or property rights within or outside a lake or beach management district including, by way of example, conservation easements authorized under RCW 64.04.130, and to promote the conservation and stewardship of shorelines as well as the conservation and stewardship of upland properties adjoining lakes or beaches for conservation or for minimal development. All or a portion of a lake or beach and the adjacent land areas may be included within one or more lake or beach management districts. More than one lake or beach, or portions of lakes or beaches, and the adjacent land areas may be included in a single lake or beach management district.

2. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "improvement" includes, among other things, the acquisition of real property and property rights within or outside a lake or beach management district for the purposes set forth in RCW 36.61.010 and this section.

3. Special assessments or rates and charges may be imposed on the property included within a lake or beach management district to finance lake or beach improvement and maintenance activities, including: (a) Controlling or removing aquatic plants and vegetation; (b) improving water quality; (c) controlling water levels; (d) treating and diverting stormwater; (e) controlling agricultural waste; (f) studying lake or marine water quality problems and solutions; (g) cleaning and maintaining ditches and streams entering the lake or marine waters or leaving the lake; (h) monitoring air quality; (i) the acquisition of real property and property rights; and (j) the related administrative, engineering, legal, and operational costs, including the costs of creating the lake or beach management district.

4. Special assessments or rates and charges may be imposed annually on all the land in a lake or beach management district for the duration of the lake or beach management district without a related issuance of lake or beach management district bonds or revenue bonds. Special assessments also may be imposed in the manner of special assessments in a local improvement district with each landowner being given the choice of paying the entire special assessment in one payment, or to paying installments, with lake or beach management district bonds being issued to obtain moneys not derived by the initial full payment of the special assessments, and the installments covering all of the costs related to issuing, selling, and redeeming the lake or beach management district bonds.

## 36.61.025 - Creation of district—Duration.
To improve the ability of counties to finance long-term lake or beach management objectives, lake or beach management districts may be created for any needed period of time.

\[ [2008 c 301 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/3186-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20301%20§%204); [2000 c 184 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/3099-S.SL.pdf?cite=2000%20c%20184%20§%204); \]

## 36.61.030 - Creation of district—Resolution or petition—Contents.
A lake or beach management district may be initiated upon either the adoption of a resolution of intention by a county legislative authority or the filing of a petition signed by ten landowners or the owners of at least twenty percent of the acreage contained within the proposed lake or beach management district, whichever is greater. A petition or resolution of intention shall set forth: (1) The nature of the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities proposed to be financed; (2) the amount of money proposed to be raised by special assessments or rates and charges; (3) if special assessments are to be imposed, whether the special assessments will be imposed annually for the duration of the lake or beach management district, or the full special assessments will be imposed at one time, with the possibility of installments being made to finance the issuance of lake or beach management district bonds, or both methods; (4) if rates and charges are to be imposed, the annual amount of revenue proposed to be collected and whether revenue bonds payable from the rates and charges are proposed to be issued; (5) the number of years proposed for the duration of the lake or beach management district; and (6) the proposed boundaries of the lake or beach management district.

The county legislative authority may require the posting of a bond of up to five thousand dollars before the county considers the proposed creation of a lake or beach management district initiated by petition. The bond may only be used by the county to finance its costs in studying, holding hearings, making notices, preparing special assessment rolls or rolls showing the rates and charges on each parcel, and conducting elections related to the lake or beach management district if the proposed lake or beach management district is not created.

A resolution of intention shall also designate the number of the proposed lake or beach management district, and fix a date, time, and place for a public hearing on the formation of the proposed lake or beach management district. The date for the public hearing shall be at least thirty days and no more than ninety days after the adoption of the resolution of intention unless an emergency exists.

Petitions shall be filed with the county legislative authority. The county legislative authority shall determine the sufficiency of the signatures, which shall be conclusive upon all persons. No person may withdraw his or her name from a petition after it is filed. If the county legislative authority determines a petition to be sufficient and the proposed lake or beach management district appears to be in the public interest and the financing of the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities is feasible, it shall adopt a resolution of intention, setting forth all of the details required to be included when a resolution of intention is initiated by the county legislative authority.

## 36.61.150 - Special assessment roll—Appeal to superior and appellate courts—Procedure.
The decision of a county legislative authority upon any objection to the special assessment roll may be appealed to the superior court only if the objection had been timely made in the manner prescribed in this chapter. The appeal shall be made within ten days after publication of a notice that the resolution confirming the special assessment roll has been adopted by filing written notice of the appeal with the county legislative authority and the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the real property is situated. The notice of appeal shall describe the property and set forth the objections of the appellant to the special assessment. Within ten days from the filing of such notice of appeal with the clerk of the superior court, the appellant shall file with the clerk of the court a transcript consisting of the special assessment roll and his or her objections thereto, together with the resolution confirming such special assessment roll and the record of the county legislative authority with reference to the special assessment or annual special assessments, which transcript, upon payment of the necessary fees therefor, shall be furnished by an officer of the county and by him or her certified to contain full, true, and correct copies of all matters and proceedings required to be included in the transcript. Such fees shall be the same as the fees payable to the county clerk for the preparation and certification of transcripts on appeal to the supreme court or the court of appeals in civil actions.

At the time of the filing of the notice of appeal with the clerk of the superior court a sufficient bond in the penal sum of two hundred dollars, with a surety or sureties thereon as provided by law for appeals in civil cases, shall be filed conditioned to prosecute such appeal without delay, and if unsuccessful, to pay all costs incurred by the county because of the appeal. The court may order the appellant, upon application therefor, to execute and file such additional bond or bonds as the necessity of the case may require.

Within three days after such transcript is filed in the superior court, the appellant shall give written notice to the county legislative authority that such transcript is filed. The notice shall state a time, not less than three days from the service thereof, when the appellant will call up the cause for hearing.

The superior court shall, at this time or at such further time as may be fixed by order of the court, hear and determine such appeal without a jury, and such cause shall have preference over all civil causes pending in the court, except proceedings under an act relating to eminent domain in such county and actions of forcible entry and detainer. The judgment of the court shall confirm, correct, modify, or annul the special assessment or annual special assessments insofar as the same affects the property of the appellant. A certified copy of the decision of the court shall be filed with the officer having custody of the special assessment roll, and he or she shall modify and correct such special assessment roll in accordance with the decision.

An appeal shall lie to the supreme court or the court of appeals from the judgment of the superior court, as in other cases, however, such appeal must be taken within fifteen days after the date of the entry of the judgment of the superior court, and the record and opening brief of the appellant in the cause shall be filed in the supreme court or the court of appeals within sixty days after the appeal is taken by notice as provided in this section. The time for filing the record and serving and filing of briefs may be extended by order of the superior court, or by stipulation of the parties concerned. The supreme court or the court of appeals on such appeal may correct, modify, confirm, or annul the special assessment or annual special assessments insofar as the same affects the property of the appellant. A certified copy of the order of the supreme court or the court of appeals upon such appeal shall be filed with the officer having custody of such special assessment roll, who shall thereupon modify and correct such special assessment roll in accordance with such decision.

## 36.61.160 - Special assessments—Calculation.
Whenever special assessments are imposed, all property included within a lake or beach management district shall be considered to be the property specially benefited by the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities and shall be the property upon which special assessments are imposed to pay the costs and expenses of the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities, or such part of the costs and expenses as may be chargeable against the property specially benefited. The special assessments shall be imposed on property in accordance with the special benefits conferred on the property up to but not in excess of the total costs and expenses of the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities as provided in the special assessment roll.

Special assessments may be measured by front footage, acreage, the extent of improvements on the property, or any other factors that are deemed to fairly reflect special benefits, including those authorized under RCW 35.51.030. Special assessments may be calculated by using more than one factor. Zones around the public improvement may be used that reflect different levels of benefit in each zone that are measured by a front footage, acreage, the extent of improvements, or other factors.

Public property, including property owned by the state of Washington, shall be subject to special assessments to the same extent that private property is subject to the special assessments, except no lien shall extend to public property.

## 36.61.170 - Special assessments—Limitations.
1. The total annual special assessments may not exceed the estimated cost of the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities proposed to be financed by such special assessments, as specified in the resolution of intention.

2. After a lake or beach management district has been created, the resolution of intention may be amended to increase or otherwise modify the amount to be financed by the lake or beach management district by using the same procedure in which a lake or beach management district is created, including landowner approvals consistent with the procedures established in RCW 36.61.080 through 36.61.100.

## 36.61.200 - Special assessments—Payment period—Interest and penalty.
If the special assessments are to be payable at one time, all or any portion of any special assessment may be paid without interest, penalty, or costs during this thirty-day period and placed into a special fund to defray the costs of the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities.

The installments shall include amounts sufficient to redeem the bonds issued to pay for the lake or beach improvement and maintenance activities. A twenty-day period shall be allowed after the due date of any installment within which no interest, penalty, or costs on the installment may be imposed.

The county shall establish by ordinance an amount of interest that will be imposed on late special assessments imposed annually or at once, and on installments of a special assessment. The ordinance shall also specify the penalty, in addition to the interest, that will be imposed on a late annual special assessment, special assessment, or installment which shall not be less than five percent of the delinquent special assessment or installment.

## 36.61.210 - Special assessments—Subdivision of land—Segregation of assessment.
Whenever any land against which there has been levied any special assessment or annual special assessments by any county has been sold in part, subdivided, or short subdivided, the county legislative authority may order a segregation of the special assessment or annual special assessments. If an installment has been made, the segregation shall apportion the remaining installments on the parts or lots created.

Any person desiring to have such a special assessment or annual special assessments against a tract of land segregated to apply to smaller parts thereof shall apply to the county legislative authority which levied the special assessment or annual special assessments. If the county legislative authority determines that a segregation should be made, it shall by resolution order the county treasurer to segregate the special assessment or annual special assessments on the original assessment roll as directed in the resolution. The segregation shall be made as nearly as possible on the same basis as the original special assessment or annual special assessments were levied, and the total of the segregated parts of the special assessment or annual special assessments shall equal the amount of the special assessment or annual special assessments unpaid before segregation. The resolution shall describe the original tract and the amount and date of the original special assessment or annual special assessments and shall define the boundaries of the divided parts and the amount of the special assessment or annual special assessments chargeable to each part. A certified copy of the resolution shall be delivered to the county treasurer who shall proceed to segregate the special assessment or annual special assessments upon being tendered a fee of three dollars for each tract of land for which a segregation is to be made. In addition to such charge the county legislative authority may require as a condition to the order of segregation that the person seeking it pay the local government the reasonable engineering and clerical costs incident to making the segregation.

## 36.61.260 - Bonds.

Lake or beach management district bonds may be issued to obtain money sufficient to cover that portion of the special assessments that are not paid within the thirty-day period provided in RCW 36.61.190.

2. Whenever lake or beach management district revenue bonds are proposed to be issued, the county legislative authority shall create a special fund or funds for the lake or beach management district from which all or a portion of the costs of the lake or beach improvement and maintenance activities shall be paid. Lake or beach management district bonds shall not be issued in excess of the costs and expenses of the lake or beach improvement and maintenance activities and shall not be issued prior to twenty days after the thirty days allowed for the payment of special assessments without interest or penalties.

3. Lake or beach management district revenue bonds shall be exclusively payable from the special fund or funds and from a guaranty fund that the county may have created out of a portion of proceeds from the sale of the lake or beach management district bonds.

4. [Empty]

   a. Lake or beach management district revenue bonds shall not constitute a general indebtedness of the county issuing the bond nor an obligation, general or special, of the state. The owner of any lake or beach management district revenue bond shall not have any claim for the payment thereof against the county that issues the bonds except for: (i) With respect to revenue bonds payable from special assessments, payment from the special assessments made for the lake or beach improvement or maintenance activities for which the lake or beach management district bond was issued and from the special fund or funds, and a lake or beach management district guaranty fund, that may have been created; and (ii) with respect to revenue bonds payable from rates and charges, payment from rates and charges deposited in the special fund or funds that the county may have created for that purpose. Revenue bonds may be payable from both special assessments and from rates and charges. The county shall not be liable to the owner of any lake or beach management district bond for any loss to a lake or beach management district guaranty fund occurring in the lawful operation of the fund. The owner of a lake or beach management district bond shall not have any claim against the state arising from the lake or beach management district bond, rates and charges, special assessments, or guaranty fund. Tax revenues shall not be used to secure or guarantee the payment of the principal of or interest on lake or beach management district bonds. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, nothing in this section may be interpreted as limiting a county's issuance of bonds pursuant to RCW 36.67.010 in order to assist in the financing of improvements to lakes or beaches located within or partially within the boundaries of the county, including without limitation lakes or beaches located within a lake or beach management district.

   b. The substance of the limitations included in this subsection (4) shall be plainly printed, written, engraved, or reproduced on: (i) Each lake or beach management district bond that is a physical instrument; (ii) the official notice of sale; and (iii) each official statement associated with the lake or beach management district bonds.

5. If the county fails to make any principal or interest payments on any lake or beach management district bond or to promptly collect any special assessment securing lake or beach management district revenue bonds when due, the owner of the lake or beach management district revenue bond may obtain a writ of mandamus from any court of competent jurisdiction requiring the county to collect the special assessments, foreclose on the related lien, and make payments out of the special fund or guaranty fund if one exists. Any number of owners of lake or beach management districts may join as plaintiffs.

6. A county may create a lake or beach management district bond guaranty fund for each issue of lake or beach management district bonds.
