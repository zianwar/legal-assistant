## 36.120.010 - Findings.
The legislature finds that:

1. The capacity of many of Washington state's transportation facilities have failed to keep up with the state's growth, particularly in major urban regions;

2. The state cannot by itself fund, in a timely way, many of the major capacity and other improvements required on highways of statewide significance in the state's largest urbanized area;

3. Providing a transportation system that provides efficient mobility for persons and freight requires a shared partnership and responsibility between the state, local, and regional governments and the private sector; and

4. Timely construction and development of significant transportation improvement projects can best be achieved through enhanced funding options for governments at the county and regional levels, using already existing tax authority to address roadway and multimodal needs and new authority for regions to address critical transportation projects of statewide significance.

## 36.120.030 - Planning committee—Formation.
Regional transportation investment district planning committees are advisory entities that are created, convened, and empowered as follows:

1. A county with a population over one million five hundred thousand persons and any adjoining counties with a population over five hundred thousand persons may create a regional transportation investment district and shall convene a regional transportation investment district planning committee.

   a. The boundaries of the district should include at least the contiguous areas within the regional transit authority serving the counties. The boundaries must be proposed by the planning committee and approved by the county legislative authorities by ordinance before or in conjunction with approval of a regional transportation investment plan. Boundaries must follow complete parcels of land. However, any portion of a county that is located on a peninsula shall be exempt from a regional transportation investment district in which more than one county is included if (i) the portion of the county located on the peninsula is connected to the other portion of the county by a bridge improved under chapter 47.46 RCW, and (ii) the county has a national park and a population of more than five hundred thousand persons, but less than one million five hundred thousand persons.

   b. After voters within the district boundaries have approved a plan under RCW 36.120.070, elections to add areas to the district boundaries may be called by a resolution of the board, after consultation with the regional transportation planning organization and affected transit agencies and with the concurrence of the legislative authority of the city or town if the area is incorporated or with the concurrence of the county legislative authority if the area is unincorporated. The election may include a single ballot measure providing annexation to the district, approval of the plan, and approval of revenue sources necessary to finance the plan. The electorate are the voters voting within the proposed area to be annexed. A simple majority of the persons voting on the single ballot measure is required for approval of the measure.

2. The members of the legislative authorities participating in planning under this chapter shall serve as the district planning committee. Members of the planning committee receive no compensation, but may be reimbursed for travel and incidental expenses as the planning committee deems appropriate.

The secretary of transportation, or the appropriate regional administrator of the department, as named by the secretary, shall serve on the committee as a nonvoting member.

3. A regional transportation investment district planning committee may be entitled to state funding, as appropriated by the legislature, for start-up funding to pay for salaries, expenses, overhead, supplies, and similar expenses ordinarily and necessarily incurred in selecting transportation projects and funding for those transportation projects under this chapter. Upon creation of a regional transportation investment district, the district shall within one year reimburse the state for any sums advanced for these start-up costs from the state.

4. The planning committee shall conduct its affairs and formulate a regional transportation investment plan as provided under RCW 36.120.040, except that it shall elect an executive board of seven members to discharge the duties of the planning committee and formulate a regional transportation investment plan, subject to the approval of the full committee.

5. At its first meeting, a regional transportation investment district planning committee may elect officers and provide for the adoption of rules and other operating procedures.

6. Governance of and decisions by a regional transportation investment district planning committee must be by a sixty-percent weighted majority vote of the total membership.

7. The planning committee may dissolve itself at any time by a two-thirds weighted majority vote of the total membership of the planning committee.

8. If a multicounty regional transportation investment district is not formed by December 1, 2007, through approval by the voters voting on a regional transportation investment plan, then the authority under this chapter to create a district, and to fund and construct transportation projects, shall be available to each of the eligible counties described in subsection (1) of this section on an individual and independent basis.

\[ [2006 c 311 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2871-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20311%20§%205); [2002 c 56 § 103](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6140-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%2056%20§%20103); \]

## 36.120.040 - Planning committee—Duties.
1. A regional transportation investment district planning committee shall adopt a regional transportation investment plan providing for the development, construction, and financing of transportation projects. The planning committee may consider the following factors in formulating its plan:

   a. Land use planning criteria;

   b. The input of cities located within a participating county; and

   c. The input of regional transportation planning organizations of which a participating county is a member. A regional transportation planning organization in which a participating county is located shall review its adopted regional transportation plan and submit, for the planning committee's consideration, its list of transportation improvement priorities.

2. The planning committee may coordinate its activities with the department, which shall provide services, data, and personnel to assist in this planning as desired by the planning committee. In addition, the planning committee may coordinate its activities with affected cities, towns, and other local governments, including any regional transit authority existing within the participating counties' boundaries, that engage in transportation planning.

3. The planning committee shall:

   a. Conduct public meetings that are needed to assure active public participation in the development of the plan;

   b. Adopt a plan proposing the:

      i. Creation of a regional transportation investment district, including district boundaries; and 

      ii. Construction of transportation projects to improve mobility within each county and within the region. Operations, maintenance, and preservation of facilities or systems may not be part of the plan, except for the limited purposes provided under RCW 36.120.020(8); and 

   c. Recommend sources of revenue authorized by RCW 36.120.050 and a financing plan to fund selected transportation projects. The overall plan of the district must leverage the district's financial contributions so that the federal, state, local, and other revenue sources continue to fund major congestion relief and transportation capacity improvement projects in each county and the district. A combination of local, state, and federal revenues may be necessary to pay for transportation projects, and the planning committee shall consider all of these revenue sources in developing a plan.

4. The plan must use tax revenues and related debt for projects that generally benefit a participating county in proportion to the general level of tax revenues generated within that participating county. This equity principle applies to all modifications to the plan, appropriation of contingency funds not identified within the project estimate, and future phases of the plan. Per agreement with a regional transit authority serving the counties participating in a district, the equity principle identified under this subsection may include using the combined district and regional transit authority revenues generated within a participating county to determine the distribution that proportionally benefits the county. For purposes of the transportation subarea equity principle established under this subsection, a district may use the five subareas within a regional transit authority's boundaries as identified in an authority's system plan adopted in May 1996. During implementation of the plan, the board shall retain the flexibility to manage distribution of revenues, debt, and project schedules so that the district may effectively implement the plan. Nothing in this section should be interpreted to prevent the district from pledging district-wide tax revenues for payment of any contract or debt entered into under RCW 36.120.130.

5. Before adopting the plan, the planning committee, with assistance from the department, shall work with the lead agency to develop accurate cost forecasts for transportation projects. This project costing methodology must be integrated with revenue forecasts in developing the plan and must at a minimum include estimated project costs in constant dollars as well as year of expenditure dollars, the range of project costs reflected by the level of project design, project contingencies, identification of mitigation costs, the range of revenue forecasts, and project and plan cash flow and bond analysis. The plan submitted to the voters must provide cost estimates for each project, including reasonable contingency costs. Plans submitted to the voters must provide that the maximum amount possible of the funds raised will be used to fund projects in the plan, including environmental improvements and mitigation, and that administrative costs be minimized. If actual revenue exceeds actual plan costs, the excess revenues must be used to retire any outstanding debt associated with the plan.

6. If a county opts not to adopt the plan or participate in the regional transportation investment district, but two or more contiguous counties do choose to continue to participate, then the planning committee may, within ninety days, redefine the regional transportation investment plan and the ballot measure to be submitted to the people to reflect elimination of the county, and submit the redefined plan to the legislative authorities of the remaining counties for their decision as to whether to continue to adopt the redefined plan and participate. This action must be completed within sixty days after receipt of the redefined plan.

7. Once adopted by the planning committee, the plan must be forwarded to the participating county legislative authorities to initiate the election process under RCW 36.120.070. The planning committee shall at the same time provide notice to each city and town within the district, the governor, the chairs of the transportation committees of the legislature, the secretary of transportation, and each legislator whose legislative district is partially or wholly within the boundaries of the district.

8. If the ballot measure is not approved, the planning committee may redefine the selected transportation projects, financing plan, and the ballot measure. The county legislative authorities may approve the new plan and ballot measure, and may then submit the revised proposition to the voters at the next election or a special election. If no ballot measure is approved by the voters by the third vote, the planning committee is dissolved.

## 36.120.045 - Planning committee—State route No. 520 improvements.
The planning committee must develop and include in the regional transportation investment plan a funding proposal for the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV project that assures full project funding for seismic safety and corridor connectivity on state route number 520 between Interstate 5 and Interstate 405.

\[ [2006 c 311 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2871-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20311%20§%207); \]

## 36.120.050 - Planning committee—Taxes, fees, and tolls.
1. A regional transportation investment district planning committee may, as part of a regional transportation investment plan, recommend the imposition or authorization of some or all of the following revenue sources, which a regional transportation investment district may impose or authorize upon approval of the voters as provided in this chapter:

   a. A regional sales and use tax, as specified in RCW 82.14.430, of up to 0.1 percent of the selling price, in the case of a sales tax, or value of the article used, in the case of a use tax, upon the occurrence of any taxable event in the regional transportation investment district;

   b. A local option vehicle license fee, as specified under RCW 82.80.100, of up to one hundred dollars per vehicle registered in the district. As used in this subsection, "vehicle" means motor vehicle as defined in RCW 46.04.320. Certain classes of vehicles, as defined under chapter 46.04 RCW, may be exempted from this fee;

   c. A parking tax under RCW 82.80.030;

   d. A local motor vehicle excise tax under RCW 81.100.060;

   e. A local option fuel tax under RCW 82.80.120;

   f. An employer excise tax under RCW 81.100.030; and

   g. Vehicle tolls on new or reconstructed local or regional arterials or state routes within the boundaries of the district, if the following conditions are met:

      i. Consistent with RCW 47.56.820, the vehicle toll must first be authorized by the legislature if the toll is imposed on a state route;

      ii. Consistent with RCW 47.56.850, the vehicle toll, including any change in an existing toll rate, must first be reviewed and approved by the tolling authority designated in RCW 47.56.850 if the toll, or change in toll rate, would have a significant impact, as determined by the tolling authority, on the operation of any state facility;

      iii. The regional transportation investment plan must identify the facilities that may be tolled; and

      iv. Unless otherwise specified by law, the department shall administer the collection of vehicle tolls on designated facilities, and the state transportation commission, or its successor, shall be the tolling authority, and shall act in accordance with RCW 47.56.850.

2. Taxes, fees, and tolls may not be imposed or authorized without an affirmative vote of the majority of the voters within the boundaries of the district voting on a ballot proposition as set forth in RCW 36.120.070. Revenues from these taxes and fees may be used only to implement the plan as set forth in this chapter. A district may contract with the state department of revenue or other appropriate entities for administration and collection of any of the taxes or fees authorized in this section.

3. Existing statewide motor vehicle fuel and special fuel taxes, at the distribution rates in effect on January 1, 2001, are not intended to be altered by this chapter.

\[ [2008 c 122 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1773-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20122%20§%2016); [2006 c 311 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2871-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20311%20§%2013); [2003 c 350 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5247-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20350%20§%204); [2002 c 56 § 105](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6140-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%2056%20§%20105); \]

## 36.120.060 - Project selection—Performance criteria.
1. The planning committee shall consider the following criteria for selecting transportation projects to improve corridor performance:

   a. Reduced level of congestion and improved safety;

   b. Improved travel time;

   c. Improved air quality;

   d. Increases in daily and peak period person and vehicle trip capacity;

   e. Reductions in person and vehicle delay;

## 36.120.070 - Submission of ballot propositions to the voters.
1. Beginning no sooner than the 2007 general election, two or more contiguous county legislative authorities, or a single county legislative authority as provided under RCW 36.120.030(8), upon receipt of the regional transportation investment plan under RCW 36.120.040, may submit to the voters of the proposed district a single ballot proposition that approves formation of the district, approves the regional transportation investment plan, and approves the revenue sources necessary to finance the plan. For a county to participate in the plan, the county legislative authority shall, within ninety days after receiving the plan, adopt an ordinance indicating the county's participation. The planning committee may draft the ballot proposition on behalf of the county legislative authorities, and the county legislative authorities may give notice as required by law for ballot propositions, and perform other duties as required to submit the proposition to the voters of the proposed district for their approval or rejection. Counties may negotiate interlocal agreements necessary to implement the plan. The electorate will be the voters voting within the boundaries of the proposed district. A simple majority of the total persons voting on the single ballot proposition is required for approval.

2. The participating counties shall submit a regional transportation investment plan at the 2007 general election as part of a single ballot proposition that includes, in conjunction with RCW 81.112.030(10), a plan to support an authority's system and financing plan, or additional implementation phases of the system and financing plan, developed under chapter 81.112 RCW.

A district may coordinate its activities with the department, which shall provide services, data, and personnel to assist as desired by the regional transportation investment district. Lead agencies for transportation projects that are not state facilities shall also provide staff support for the board.

3. A district may not acquire, hold, or dispose of real property.

4. Except for the limited purposes provided under RCW 36.120.020(8), a district may not own, operate, or maintain an ongoing facility, road, or transportation system.

6. It is the intent of the legislature that administrative and overhead costs of a regional transportation investment district be minimized. For transportation projects costing up to fifty million dollars, administrative and overhead costs may not exceed three percent of the total construction and design project costs per year. For transportation projects costing more than fifty million dollars, administrative and overhead costs may not exceed three percent of the first fifty million dollars in costs, plus an additional one-tenth of one percent of each additional dollar above fifty million. These limitations apply only to the district, and do not limit the administration or expenditures of the department.

7. A district may use the design-build procedure for transportation projects developed by it. As used in this section "design-build procedure" means a method of contracting under which the district contracts with another party for that party to both design and build the structures, facilities, and other items specified in the contract. The requirements and limitations of RCW 47.20.780 and 47.20.785 do not apply to the transportation projects under this chapter.

Collection and expenditures of any high capacity transportation taxes implemented under this section must be determined by agreement between the participating counties or district and the regional transit authority electing to submit high capacity transportation taxes to the voters under a common ballot measure as provided in this section. If the measure fails, all such unused high capacity transportation taxes revert back to and remain with the regional transit authority. A project constructed with this funding is not considered a "transportation project" under RCW 36.120.020.
