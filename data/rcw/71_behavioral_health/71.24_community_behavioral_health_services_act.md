## 71.24.015 - Legislative intent—Community behavioral health system.
It is the intent of the legislature to establish a community behavioral health system which shall help people experiencing mental illness or a substance use disorder to retain a respected and productive position in the community. This will be accomplished through programs that focus on resilience and recovery, and practices that are evidence-based, research-based, consensus-based, or, where these do not exist, promising or emerging best practices, which provide for:

1. Access to behavioral health services for adults with mental illness and children with mental illness, emotional disturbances, or substance use disorders, that recognize the special needs of underserved populations, including minorities, children, older adults, individuals with disabilities, and low-income persons. Access to mental health and substance use disorder services shall not be limited by a person's history of confinement in a state, federal, or local correctional facility. It is also the purpose of this chapter to promote the early identification of children with mental illness and to ensure that they receive the mental health care and treatment which is appropriate to their developmental level. This care should improve home, school, and community functioning, maintain children in a safe and nurturing home environment, and should enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment while also recognizing parents' rights to participate in treatment decisions for their children;

2. The involvement of persons with mental illness or substance use disorder, their family members, and advocates in designing and implementing behavioral health services that reduce unnecessary hospitalization and incarceration and promote recovery and employment. To improve the quality of services available and promote the rehabilitation, recovery, and reintegration of persons with mental illness or substance use disorder, consumer and advocate participation in behavioral health services is an integral part of the community behavioral health system and shall be supported;

3. Accountability of efficient and effective services through state-of-the-art outcome and performance measures and statewide standards for monitoring client and system outcomes, performance, and reporting of client and system outcome information. These processes shall be designed so as to maximize the use of available resources for direct care of people with a mental illness and to assure uniform data collection across the state;

4. Minimum service delivery standards;

5. Priorities for the use of available resources for the care of individuals with mental illness or substance use disorder consistent with the priorities defined in the statute;

6. Coordination of services within the department of social and health services, the authority, the department, the department of children, youth, and families, and the office of the superintendent of public instruction, and among state mental hospitals, tribes, residential treatment facilities, county authorities, behavioral health administrative services organizations, managed care organizations, community behavioral health services, and other support services, which shall to the maximum extent feasible also include the families of individuals with mental illness or substance use disorder, and other service providers, including Indian health care providers; and

7. Coordination of services aimed at reducing duplication in service delivery and promoting complementary services among all entities that provide behavioral health services to adults and children.

It is the policy of the state to encourage the provision of a full range of treatment and rehabilitation services in the state for mental disorders, or substance use disorders, including services operated by consumers and advocates. The legislature intends to encourage the development of regional behavioral health services with adequate local flexibility to assure eligible people in need of care access to the least-restrictive treatment alternative appropriate to their needs, and the availability of treatment components to assure continuity of care. The legislature hereby finds and declares that sound fiscal management requires vigilance to ensure that funds appropriated by the legislature for the provision of needed community behavioral health system services are ultimately expended solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated, and not for any other purpose.

3. The authority shall establish a work group to determine: (a) How to appropriately manage access to adult long-term inpatient involuntary care and the children's long-term inpatient program in the community and at eastern and western state hospitals, until such a time as the risk for long-term involuntary inpatient care may be fully integrated into managed care organization contracts, and provide advice to guide the integration process; and (b) how to expand bidirectional integration through increased support for co-occurring disorder services, including recommendations related to purchasing and rates. The work group shall include representation from the department of social and health services, the department of health, behavioral health administrative services organizations, at least two managed care organizations, the Washington state association of counties, community behavioral health providers, including providers with experience providing co-occurring disorder services, and the Washington state hospital association. Managed care representation on the work group must include at least one member with financial expertise and at least one member with clinical expertise.

5. The department may suspend, revoke, limit, restrict, or modify an approval, or refuse to grant approval, for failure to meet the provisions of this chapter, or the standards adopted under this chapter. RCW 43.70.115 governs notice of a license or certification denial, revocation, suspension, or modification and provides the right to an adjudicative proceeding.

6. No licensed or certified behavioral health service provider may advertise or represent itself as a licensed or certified behavioral health service provider if approval has not been granted or has been denied, suspended, revoked, or canceled.

7. Licensure or certification as a behavioral health service provider is effective for one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license or certification. The license or certification must specify the types of services provided by the behavioral health service provider that meet the standards adopted under this chapter. Renewal of a license or certification must be made in accordance with this section for initial approval and in accordance with the standards set forth in rules adopted by the secretary.

8. Licensure or certification as a licensed or certified behavioral health service provider must specify the types of services provided that meet the standards adopted under this chapter.

11. The department periodically shall inspect licensed or certified behavioral health service providers at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

12. Upon petition of the department and after a hearing held upon reasonable notice to the facility, the superior court may issue a warrant to an officer or employee of the department authorizing him or her to enter and inspect at reasonable times, and examine the books and accounts of, any licensed or certified behavioral health service provider refusing to consent to inspection or examination by the department or which the department has reasonable cause to believe is operating in violation of this chapter.

14. Each licensed or certified behavioral health service provider shall file with the department or the authority upon request, data, statistics, schedules, and information the department or the authority reasonably requires.

15. The authority shall use the data provided in subsection (14) of this section to evaluate each program that admits children to inpatient substance use disorder treatment upon application of their parents. The evaluation must be done at least once every twelve months.

16. Any settlement agreement entered into between the department and licensed or certified behavioral health service providers to resolve administrative complaints, license or certification violations, license or certification suspensions, or license or certification revocations may not reduce the number of violations reported by the department unless the department concludes, based on evidence gathered by inspectors, that the licensed or certified behavioral health service provider did not commit one or more of the violations.

17. In cases in which a behavioral health service provider that is in violation of licensing or certification standards attempts to transfer or sell the behavioral health service provider to a family member, the transfer or sale may only be made for the purpose of remedying license or certification violations and achieving full compliance with the terms of the license or certification. Transfers or sales to family members are prohibited in cases in which the purpose of the transfer or sale is to avoid liability or reset the number of license or certification violations found before the transfer or sale. If the department finds that the owner intends to transfer or sell, or has completed the transfer or sale of, ownership of the behavioral health service provider to a family member solely for the purpose of resetting the number of violations found before the transfer or sale, the department may not renew the behavioral health service provider's license or certification or issue a new license or certification to the behavioral health service provider.

## 71.24.450 - Offenders with mental illnesses—Findings and intent.
1. Many offenders with acute and chronic mental illness are delayed in their release from Washington correctional facilities due to their inability to access reasonable treatment and living accommodations prior to the maximum expiration of their sentences. Often the offender reaches the end of his or her sentence and is released without any follow-up care, funds, or housing. These delays are costly to the state, often lead to psychiatric relapse, and result in unnecessary risk to the public.

Many of these offenders lack the skills or emotional stability to maintain employment or even complete applications to receive entitlement funding. Housing and appropriate treatment are difficult to obtain.

This lack of resources, funding, treatment, and housing creates additional stress for the offender with mental illness, impairing self-control and judgment. When the mental illness is instrumental in the offender's patterns of crime, such stresses may lead to a worsening of his or her illness, reoffending, and a threat to public safety.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to create a program to provide for postrelease mental health care and housing for a select group of offenders with mental illness entering community living, in order to reduce incarceration costs, increase public safety, and enhance the offender's quality of life.

\[ [2019 c 325 § 1027](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5432-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20325%20§%201027); [1997 c 342 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6002-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20342%20§%201); \]

The program shall enroll no more than twenty-five offenders at any one time, or a number of offenders that can be accommodated within the appropriated funding level, and shall seek to fill any vacancies that occur.

2. Criteria shall include a determination by department of corrections staff that:

3. The behavioral health administrative services organization, managed care organization, behavioral health agency, or private provider shall provide specialized access and services to the selected offenders.

An oversight committee composed of a representative of the authority, a representative of the selected managed care organization, behavioral health administrative services organization, or private provider, and a representative of the department of corrections shall develop policies to guide the pilot program, provide dispute resolution including making determinations as to when entrance criteria or required services may be waived in individual cases, advise the department of corrections and the managed care organization, behavioral health administrative services organization, or private provider on the selection of eligible offenders, and set minimum requirements for service contracts. The selected managed care organization, behavioral health administrative services organization, or private provider shall implement the policies and service contracts. The following services shall be provided:

Intensive case management to include a full range of intensive community support and treatment in client-to-staff ratios of not more than ten offenders per case manager including: (i) A minimum of weekly group and weekly individual counseling; (ii) home visits by the program manager at least two times per month; and (iii) counseling focusing on maintaining and promoting ongoing stability, relapse prevention, and recovery.

   b. The case manager shall attempt to locate and procure housing appropriate to the living and clinical needs of the offender and as needed to maintain the psychiatric stability of the offender. The entire range of emergency, transitional, and permanent housing and involuntary hospitalization must be considered as available housing options. A housing subsidy may be provided to offenders to defray housing costs up to a maximum of six thousand six hundred dollars per offender per year and be administered by the case manager. Additional funding sources may be used to offset these costs when available.

   c. The case manager shall collaborate with the assigned prison, work release, or community corrections staff during release planning, prior to discharge, and in ongoing supervision of the offender while under the authority of the department of corrections.

   d. Medications including the full range of psychotropic medications including atypical antipsychotic medications may be required as a condition of the program. Medication prescription, medication monitoring, and counseling to support offender understanding, acceptance, and compliance with prescribed medication regimens must be included.

   e. A systematic effort to engage offenders to continuously involve themselves in current and long-term treatment and appropriate habilitative activities shall be made.

   f. Classes appropriate to the clinical and living needs of the offender and appropriate to his or her level of understanding.

   g. The case manager shall assist the offender in the application and qualification for entitlement funding, including medicaid, state assistance, and other available government and private assistance at any point that the offender is qualified and resources are available.

   h. The offender shall be provided access to daily activities such as drop-in centers, prevocational and vocational training and jobs, and volunteer activities.

4. Once an offender has been selected into the pilot program, the offender shall remain in the program until the end of his or her sentence or unless the offender is released from the pilot program earlier by the department of corrections.

5. Specialized training in the management and supervision of high-crime risk offenders with mental illness shall be provided to all participating mental health providers by the authority and the department of corrections prior to their participation in the program and as requested thereafter.

## 71.24.580 - Criminal justice treatment account.
1. The criminal justice treatment account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account may be expended solely for: (a) Substance use disorder treatment and treatment support services for offenders with a substance use disorder that, if not treated, would result in addiction, against whom charges are filed by a prosecuting attorney in Washington state; (b) the provision of substance use disorder treatment services and treatment support services for nonviolent offenders within a drug court program and, during the 2021-23 fiscal biennium, for 180 days following graduation from the drug court program; and (c) the administrative and overhead costs associated with the operation of a drug court. Amounts provided in this subsection must be used for treatment and recovery support services for criminally involved offenders and authorization of these services shall not be subject to determinations of medical necessity. During the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia, funding from the criminal justice treatment account may be used to provide treatment and support services through the conclusion of an individual's treatment plan to individuals participating in a drug court program as of February 24, 2021, if that individual wishes to continue treatment following dismissal of charges they were facing under RCW 69.50.4013(1). Such participation is voluntary and contingent upon substantial compliance with drug court program requirements. The legislature may appropriate from the account for municipal drug courts and increased treatment options. During the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to make transfers of moneys in the criminal justice treatment account to the home security fund account created in RCW 43.185C.060. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.

2. For purposes of this section:

   a. "Treatment" means services that are critical to a participant's successful completion of his or her substance use disorder treatment program, including but not limited to the recovery support and other programmatic elements outlined in RCW 2.30.030 authorizing therapeutic courts; and

   b. "Treatment support" includes transportation to or from inpatient or outpatient treatment services when no viable alternative exists, and child care services that are necessary to ensure a participant's ability to attend outpatient treatment sessions.

3. Revenues to the criminal justice treatment account consist of: (a) Funds transferred to the account pursuant to this section; and (b) any other revenues appropriated to or deposited in the account.

4. [Empty]

   a. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2005, and each subsequent fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer eight million two hundred fifty thousand dollars from the general fund to the criminal justice treatment account, divided into four equal quarterly payments. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2006, and each subsequent fiscal year, the amount transferred shall be increased on an annual basis by the implicit price deflator as published by the federal bureau of labor statistics.

   b. In each odd-numbered year, the legislature shall appropriate the amount transferred to the criminal justice treatment account in (a) of this subsection to the department for the purposes of subsection (5) of this section.

5. Moneys appropriated to the authority from the criminal justice treatment account shall be distributed as specified in this subsection. The authority may retain up to three percent of the amount appropriated under subsection (4)(b) of this section for its administrative costs.

   a. Seventy percent of amounts appropriated to the authority from the account shall be distributed to counties pursuant to the distribution formula adopted under this section. The authority, in consultation with the department of corrections, the Washington state association of counties, the Washington state association of drug court professionals, the superior court judges' association, the Washington association of prosecuting attorneys, representatives of the criminal defense bar, representatives of substance use disorder treatment providers, and any other person deemed by the authority to be necessary, shall establish a fair and reasonable methodology for distribution to counties of moneys in the criminal justice treatment account. County or regional plans submitted for the expenditure of formula funds must be approved by the panel established in (b) of this subsection.

   b. Thirty percent of the amounts appropriated to the authority from the account shall be distributed as grants for purposes of treating offenders against whom charges are filed by a county prosecuting attorney. The authority shall appoint a panel of representatives from the Washington association of prosecuting attorneys, the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, the superior court judges' association, the Washington state association of counties, the Washington defender's association or the Washington association of criminal defense lawyers, the department of corrections, the Washington state association of drug court professionals, and substance use disorder treatment providers. The panel shall review county or regional plans for funding under (a) of this subsection and grants approved under this subsection. The panel shall attempt to ensure that treatment as funded by the grants is available to offenders statewide.

6. The county alcohol and drug coordinator, county prosecutor, county sheriff, county superior court, a substance abuse treatment provider appointed by the county legislative authority, a member of the criminal defense bar appointed by the county legislative authority, and, in counties with a drug court, a representative of the drug court shall jointly submit a plan, approved by the county legislative authority or authorities, to the panel established in subsection (5)(b) of this section, for disposition of all the funds provided from the criminal justice treatment account within that county. The submitted plan should incorporate current evidence-based practices in substance use disorder treatment. The funds shall be used solely to provide approved alcohol and substance use disorder treatment pursuant to RCW 71.24.560 and treatment support services. No more than ten percent of the total moneys received under subsections (4) and (5) of this section by a county or group of counties participating in a regional agreement shall be spent for treatment support services.

7. Counties are encouraged to consider regional agreements and submit regional plans for the efficient delivery of treatment under this section.

8. Moneys allocated under this section shall be used to supplement, not supplant, other federal, state, and local funds used for substance abuse treatment.

9. If a region or county uses criminal justice treatment account funds to support a therapeutic court, the therapeutic court must allow the use of all medications approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder as deemed medically appropriate for a participant by a medical professional. If appropriate medication-assisted treatment resources are not available or accessible within the jurisdiction, the health care authority's designee for assistance must assist the court with acquiring the resource.

10. Counties must meet the criteria established in RCW 2.30.030(3).

11. The authority shall annually review and monitor the expenditures made by any county or group of counties that receives appropriated funds distributed under this section. Counties shall repay any funds that are not spent in accordance with the requirements of its contract with the authority.

## 71.24.585 - Opioid and substance use disorder treatment—State response.
1. [Empty]

   a. The state of Washington declares that substance use disorders are medical conditions. Substance use disorders should be treated in a manner similar to other medical conditions by using interventions that are supported by evidence, including medications approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. It is also recognized that many individuals have multiple substance use disorders, as well as histories of trauma, developmental disabilities, or mental health conditions. As such, all individuals experiencing opioid use disorder should be offered evidence-supported treatments to include federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders and behavioral counseling and social supports to address them. For behavioral health agencies, an effective plan of treatment for most persons with opioid use disorder integrates access to medications and psychosocial counseling and should be consistent with the American society of addiction medicine patient placement criteria. Providers must inform patients with opioid use disorder or substance use disorder of options to access federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder or substance use disorder. Because some such medications are controlled substances in chapter 69.50 RCW, the state of Washington maintains the legal obligation and right to regulate the uses of these medications in the treatment of opioid use disorder.

   b. The authority must work with other state agencies and stakeholders to develop value-based payment strategies to better support the ongoing care of persons with opioid and other substance use disorders.

   c. The department of corrections shall develop policies to prioritize services based on available grant funding and funds appropriated specifically for opioid use disorder treatment.

2. The authority must promote the use of medication therapies and other evidence-based strategies to address the opioid epidemic in Washington state. Additionally, by January 1, 2020, the authority must prioritize state resources for the provision of treatment and recovery support services to inpatient and outpatient treatment settings that allow patients to start or maintain their use of medications for opioid use disorder while engaging in services.

3. The state declares that the main goals of treatment for persons with opioid use disorder are the cessation of unprescribed opioid use, reduced morbidity, and restoration of the ability to lead a productive and fulfilling life.

4. To achieve the goals in subsection (3) of this section, to promote public health and safety, and to promote the efficient and economic use of funding for the medicaid program under Title XIX of the social security act, the authority may seek, receive, and expend alternative sources of funding to support all aspects of the state's response to the opioid crisis.

5. The authority must partner with the department of social and health services, the department of corrections, the department of health, the department of children, youth, and families, and any other agencies or entities the authority deems appropriate to develop a statewide approach to leveraging medicaid funding to treat opioid use disorder and provide emergency overdose treatment. Such alternative sources of funding may include:

   a. Seeking a section 1115 demonstration waiver from the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services to fund opioid treatment medications for persons eligible for medicaid at or during the time of incarceration and juvenile detention facilities; and

   b. Soliciting and receiving private funds, grants, and donations from any willing person or entity.

6. [Empty]

   a. The authority shall work with the department of health to promote coordination between medication-assisted treatment prescribers, federally accredited opioid treatment programs, substance use disorder treatment facilities, and state-certified substance use disorder treatment agencies to:

      i. Increase patient choice in receiving medication and counseling;

      ii. Strengthen relationships between opioid use disorder providers;

      iii. Acknowledge and address the challenges presented for individuals needing treatment for multiple substance use disorders simultaneously; and

      iv. Study and review effective methods to identify and reach out to individuals with opioid use disorder who are at high risk of overdose and not involved in traditional systems of care, such as homeless individuals using syringe service programs, and connect such individuals to appropriate treatment.

   b. The authority must work with stakeholders to develop a set of recommendations to the governor and the legislature that:

      i. Propose, in addition to those required by federal law, a standard set of services needed to support the complex treatment needs of persons with opioid use disorder treated in opioid treatment programs;

      ii. Outline the components of and strategies needed to develop opioid treatment program centers of excellence that provide fully integrated care for persons with opioid use disorder;

      iii. Estimate the costs needed to support these models and recommendations for funding strategies that must be included in the report;

      iv. Outline strategies to increase the number of waivered health care providers approved for prescribing buprenorphine by the substance abuse and mental health services administration; and

      v. Outline strategies to lower the cost of federal food and drug administration approved products for the treatment of opioid use disorder.

7. State agencies shall review and promote positive outcomes associated with the accountable communities of health funded opioid projects and local law enforcement and human services opioid collaborations as set forth in the Washington state interagency opioid working plan.

8. The authority must partner with the department and other state agencies to replicate effective approaches for linking individuals who have had a nonfatal overdose with treatment opportunities, with a goal to connect certified peer counselors with individuals who have had a nonfatal overdose.

9. State agencies must work together to increase outreach and education about opioid overdoses to non-English-speaking communities by developing a plan to conduct outreach and education to non-English-speaking communities. The department must submit a report on the outreach and education plan with recommendations for implementation to the appropriate legislative committees by July 1, 2020.

2. Under the pilot project, the authority must partner with the law enforcement assisted diversion national support bureau to award a contract, subject to appropriation, for two or more geographic areas in the state of Washington for law enforcement assisted diversion. Cities, counties, and tribes may compete for participation in a pilot project.

3. The pilot projects must provide for comprehensive technical assistance from law enforcement assisted diversion implementation experts to develop and implement a law enforcement assisted diversion program in the pilot project's geographic areas in a way that ensures fidelity to the research-based law enforcement assisted diversion model.

4. The key elements of a law enforcement assisted diversion pilot project must include:

   a. Long-term case management for individuals with substance use disorders;

   b. Facilitation and coordination with community resources focusing on overdose prevention;

   c. Facilitation and coordination with community resources focused on the prevention of infectious disease transmission;

1. When making a decision on an application for licensing or certification of a program, the department shall:

   a. Consult with the county legislative authorities in the area in which an applicant proposes to locate a program and the city legislative authority in any city in which an applicant proposes to locate a program;

   b. License or certify only programs that will be sited in accordance with the appropriate county or city land use ordinances. Counties and cities may require conditional use permits with reasonable conditions for the siting of programs. Pursuant to RCW 36.70A.200, no local comprehensive plan or development regulation may preclude the siting of essential public facilities;

   c. Not discriminate in its licensing or certification decision on the basis of the corporate structure of the applicant;

   d. Consider the size of the population in need of treatment in the area in which the program would be located and license or certify only applicants whose programs meet the necessary treatment needs of that population;

   e. Consider the availability of other certified opioid treatment programs near the area in which the applicant proposes to locate the program;

   f. Consider the transportation systems that would provide service to the program and whether the systems will provide reasonable opportunities to access the program for persons in need of treatment;

   g. Consider whether the applicant has, or has demonstrated in the past, the capability to provide the appropriate services to assist the persons who utilize the program in meeting goals established by the legislature in RCW 71.24.585.

## 71.24.890 - National 988 system—Crisis call center hubs—Technology and platform development—Agency collaboration.
1. Establishing the state crisis call center hubs and enhancing the crisis response system will require collaborative work between the department and the authority within their respective roles. The department shall have primary responsibility for establishing and designating the crisis call center hubs. The authority shall have primary responsibility for developing and implementing the crisis response system and services to support the work of the crisis call center hubs. In any instance in which one agency is identified as the lead, the expectation is that agency will be communicating and collaborating with the other to ensure seamless, continuous, and effective service delivery within the statewide crisis response system.

2. The department shall provide adequate funding for the state's crisis call centers to meet an expected increase in the use of the call centers based on the implementation of the 988 crisis hotline. The funding level shall be established at a level anticipated to achieve an in-state call response rate of at least 90 percent by July 22, 2022. The funding level shall be determined by considering standards and cost per call predictions provided by the administrator of the national suicide prevention lifeline, call volume predictions, guidance on crisis call center performance metrics, and necessary technology upgrades.

3. The department shall adopt rules by July 1, 2023, to establish standards for designation of crisis call centers as crisis call center hubs. The department shall collaborate with the authority and other agencies to assure coordination and availability of services, and shall consider national guidelines for behavioral health crisis care as determined by the federal substance abuse and mental health services administration, national behavioral health accrediting bodies, and national behavioral health provider associations to the extent they are appropriate, and recommendations from the crisis response improvement strategy committee created in RCW 71.24.892.

4. The department shall designate crisis call center hubs by July 1, 2024. The crisis call center hubs shall provide crisis intervention services, triage, care coordination, referrals, and connections to individuals contacting the 988 crisis hotline from any jurisdiction within Washington 24 hours a day, seven days a week, using the system platform developed under subsection (5) of this section.

   a. To be designated as a crisis call center hub, the applicant must demonstrate to the department the ability to comply with the requirements of this section and to contract to provide crisis call center hub services. The department may revoke the designation of any crisis call center hub that fails to substantially comply with the contract.

   b. The contracts entered shall require designated crisis call center hubs to:

      i. Have an active agreement with the administrator of the national suicide prevention lifeline for participation within its network;

      ii. Meet the requirements for operational and clinical standards established by the department and based upon the national suicide prevention lifeline best practices guidelines and other recognized best practices;

      iii. Employ highly qualified, skilled, and trained clinical staff who have sufficient training and resources to provide empathy to callers in acute distress, de-escalate crises, assess behavioral health disorders and suicide risk, triage to system partners, and provide case management and documentation. Call center staff shall be trained to make every effort to resolve cases in the least restrictive environment and without law enforcement involvement whenever possible. Call center staff shall coordinate with certified peer counselors to provide follow-up and outreach to callers in distress as available. It is intended for transition planning to include a pathway for continued employment and skill advancement as needed for experienced crisis call center employees;

      iv. Collaborate with the authority, the national suicide prevention lifeline, and veterans crisis line networks to assure consistency of public messaging about the 988 crisis hotline; and

      v. Provide data and reports and participate in evaluations and related quality improvement activities, according to standards established by the department in collaboration with the authority.

   c. The department and the authority shall incorporate recommendations from the crisis response improvement strategy committee created under RCW 71.24.892 in its agreements with crisis call center hubs, as appropriate.

5. The department and authority must coordinate to develop the technology and platforms necessary to manage and operate the behavioral health crisis response and suicide prevention system. The technologies developed must include:

   a. A new technologically advanced behavioral health and suicide prevention crisis call center system platform using technology demonstrated to be interoperable across crisis and emergency response systems used throughout the state, such as 911 systems, emergency medical services systems, and other nonbehavioral health crisis services, for use in crisis call center hubs designated by the department under subsection (4) of this section. This platform, which shall be fully funded by July 1, 2023, shall be developed by the department and must include the capacity to receive crisis assistance requests through phone calls, texts, chats, and other similar methods of communication that may be developed in the future that promote access to the behavioral health crisis system; and

   b. A behavioral health integrated client referral system capable of providing system coordination information to crisis call center hubs and the other entities involved in behavioral health care. This system shall be developed by the authority.
