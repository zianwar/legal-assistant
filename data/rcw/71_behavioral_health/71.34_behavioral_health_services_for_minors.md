## 71.34.010 - Purpose.
1. It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that minors in need of behavioral health care and treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and involuntary treatment. To facilitate the continuum of care and treatment to minors in out-of-home placements, all divisions of the authority and the department that provide behavioral health services to minors shall jointly plan and deliver those services.

2. It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the rights of adolescents to confidentiality and to independently seek services for behavioral health disorders. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall guard against needless hospitalization and deprivations of liberty, enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment, and encourage the use of voluntary services. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall, whenever clinically appropriate, offer less restrictive alternatives to inpatient treatment. Additionally, all behavioral health care and treatment providers shall assure that minors' parents are given an opportunity to participate in the treatment decisions for their minor children. The behavioral health care and treatment providers shall, to the extent possible, offer services that involve minors' parents or family.

3. [Empty]

   a. It is the intent of the legislature to enhance continuity of care for minors with serious behavioral health disorders that can be controlled or stabilized in a less restrictive alternative commitment. Within the guidelines stated in In re LaBelle, 107 Wn.2d 196 (1986), the legislature intends to encourage appropriate interventions at a point when there is the best opportunity to restore the minor to or maintain satisfactory functioning.

   b. For minors with a prior history or pattern of repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions due to decompensation, the consideration of prior behavioral health history is particularly relevant in determining whether the minor would receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.

   c. Therefore, the legislature finds that for minors who are currently under a commitment order, a prior history of decompensation leading to repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions should be given great weight in determining whether a new less restrictive alternative commitment should be ordered. The court must also consider any school behavioral issues, the impact on the family, the safety of other children in the household, and the developmental age of the minor.

4. It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the health and safety of minors suffering from behavioral health disorders and to protect public safety through use of the parens patriae and police powers of the state. Accordingly, when construing the requirements of this chapter the court must focus on the merits of the petition, except where requirements have been totally disregarded, as provided in In re C.W., 147 Wn.2d 259, 281 (2002). A presumption in favor of deciding petitions on their merits furthers both public and private interests because the mental and physical well-being of minors as well as public safety may be implicated by the decision to release a minor and discontinue his or her treatment.

5. It is also the purpose of this chapter to assure the ability of parents to exercise reasonable, compassionate care and control of their minor children when there is a medical necessity for treatment and without the requirement of filing a petition under this chapter, including the ability to request and receive medically necessary treatment for their adolescent children without the consent of the adolescent.

   a. For adolescents receiving inpatient treatment, the physician or other mental health professional shall conduct the review not less than seven nor more than fourteen days following the date the adolescent was brought to the facility under RCW 71.34.600 to determine whether it is a medical necessity to continue the adolescent's treatment on an inpatient basis.

3. If, after any review conducted by the authority under this section, the authority determines it is no longer a medical necessity for an adolescent to receive inpatient treatment, the authority shall immediately notify the parents and the facility. The facility shall release the adolescent to the parents within twenty-four hours of receiving notice. If the professional person in charge and the parent believe that it is a medical necessity for the adolescent to remain in inpatient treatment, the adolescent shall be released to the parent on the second judicial day following the authority's determination in order to allow the parent time to file an at-risk youth petition under chapter 13.32A RCW. If the authority determines it is a medical necessity for the adolescent to receive outpatient treatment and the adolescent declines to obtain such treatment, such refusal shall be grounds for the parent to file an at-risk youth petition.

If it is determined under subsection (1) of this section that the adolescent suffers from a behavioral health disorder, inpatient treatment is required, the adolescent is unwilling to consent to voluntary admission, and the professional person believes that the adolescent meets the criteria for initial detention, the facility may detain or arrange for the detention of the adolescent for up to twelve hours, not including time periods prior to medical clearance, in order to enable a designated crisis responder to evaluate the adolescent and commence initial detention proceedings under the provisions of this chapter.

3. Dismissal of a commitment petition is not the appropriate remedy for a violation of the timeliness requirements of this section, based on the purpose of this chapter under RCW 71.34.010, except in the few cases where the facility staff or the designated crisis responder have totally disregarded the requirements of this section.

A secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program must be available and have adequate space for the adolescent.

   b. If a designated crisis responder decides not to detain an adolescent for evaluation and treatment under RCW 71.34.700(2), or forty-eight hours have elapsed since a designated crisis responder received a request for investigation and the designated crisis responder has not taken action to have the adolescent detained, an immediate family member or guardian or conservator of the adolescent, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe, may petition the superior court for the adolescent's detention using the procedures under RCW 71.05.201 and 71.05.203; however, when the court enters an order of initial detention, except as otherwise expressly stated in this chapter, all procedures must be followed as if the order has been entered under (a) of this subsection.

Within twelve hours of the adolescent's arrival at the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program, the designated crisis responder shall serve or cause to be served on the adolescent a copy of the petition for initial detention, notice of initial detention, and statement of rights. The designated crisis responder shall file with the court on the next judicial day following the initial detention the original petition for initial detention, notice of initial detention, and statement of rights along with an affidavit of service. The designated crisis responder shall commence service of the petition for initial detention and notice of the initial detention on the adolescent's parent and the adolescent's attorney as soon as possible following the initial detention.

   b. The facility or program may serve the adolescent, notify the adolescent's parents and the adolescent's attorney, and file with the court on the next judicial day following the initial detention the original petition for initial detention, notice of initial detention, and statement of rights along with an affidavit of service when filing with the court at the request of the designated crisis responder.

8. Tribal court orders for involuntary commitment shall be recognized and enforced in accordance with superior court civil rule 82.5.

9. In any investigation and evaluation of a juvenile under this section in which the designated crisis responder knows, or has reason to know, that the juvenile is an American Indian or Alaska Native who receives medical or behavioral health services from a tribe within this state, the designated crisis responder shall notify the tribe and the Indian health care provider regarding whether or not a petition for initial detention or involuntary outpatient treatment will be filed. Notification shall be made in person or by telephonic or electronic communication to the tribal contact listed in the authority's tribal crisis coordination plan as soon as possible but no later than three hours subject to the requirements in RCW 70.02.230 (2)(ee) and (3).

Reasonable measures shall be taken to ensure medical treatment is provided for any condition requiring immediate medical attention.

2. If, at any time during the involuntary treatment hold and following the initial examination and evaluation, the children's mental health specialist or substance use disorder specialist and the physician, physician assistant, or psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner determine that the initial needs of the minor, if detained to an evaluation and treatment facility, would be better served by placement in a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program or, if detained to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program, would be better served in an evaluation and treatment facility, then the minor shall be referred to the more appropriate placement for the remainder of the current commitment period without any need for further court review; however a minor may only be referred to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program if there is a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program available and that has adequate space for the minor.

3. The admitting facility shall take reasonable steps to notify immediately the minor's parent of the admission.

4. During the initial one hundred twenty hour treatment period, the minor has a right to associate or receive communications from parents or others unless the professional person in charge determines that such communication would be seriously detrimental to the minor's condition or treatment and so indicates in the minor's clinical record, and notifies the minor's parents of this determination. A minor must not be denied the opportunity to consult an attorney unless there is an immediate risk of harm to the minor or others.

5. If the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program admits the minor, it may detain the minor for evaluation and treatment for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty hours from the time of provisional acceptance. The computation of such one hundred twenty hour period shall exclude Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. This initial treatment period shall not exceed one hundred twenty hours except when an application for voluntary inpatient treatment is received or a petition for fourteen-day commitment is filed.

6. Within twelve hours of the admission, the facility shall advise the minor of his or her rights as set forth in this chapter.

2. The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall contain the following:

   a. The name and address of the petitioner or petitioners;

   b. The name of the minor alleged to meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment;

   c. A statement that the petitioner is the professional person in charge of the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program responsible for the treatment of the minor;

   d. The date of the fourteen-day commitment order; and

   e. A summary of the facts supporting the petition.

3. The petition shall be supported by accompanying affidavits signed by: (a) Two examining physicians, one of whom shall be a child psychiatrist, or two psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioners, one of whom shall be a child and adolescent or family psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner. If the petition is for substance use disorder treatment, the petition may be signed by a substance use disorder professional instead of a mental health professional and by an advanced registered nurse practitioner instead of a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, or two physician assistants, one of whom must be supervised by a child psychiatrist; (b) one children's mental health specialist and either an examining physician, physician assistant, or a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner; or (c) two among an examining physician, physician assistant, and a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, one of which needs to be a child psychiatrist, a physician assistant supervised by a child psychiatrist, or a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse practitioner. The affidavits shall describe in detail the behavior of the detained minor which supports the petition and shall state whether a less restrictive alternative to inpatient treatment is in the best interests of the minor.

4. The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall be filed with the clerk of the court at least three days before the expiration of the fourteen-day commitment period. The petitioner or the petitioner's designee shall within twenty-four hours of filing serve a copy of the petition on the minor and notify the minor's attorney and the minor's parent. A copy of the petition shall be provided to such persons at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing.

5. At the time of filing, the court shall set a date within seven days for the hearing on the petition. If the hearing is not commenced within thirty days after the filing of the petition, including extensions of time requested by the detained person or his or her attorney or the court in the administration of justice under RCW 71.34.735, the minor must be released. The minor or the parents shall be afforded the same rights as in a fourteen-day commitment hearing. Treatment of the minor shall continue pending the proceeding.

6. For one hundred eighty-day commitment:

   a. The court must find by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the minor:

      i. Is suffering from a mental disorder or substance use disorder;

      ii. Presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled; and

      iii. Is in need of further treatment that only can be provided in a one hundred eighty-day commitment.

   b. If commitment is for a substance use disorder, the court must find that there is an available approved substance use disorder treatment program that has adequate space for the minor.

7. In determining whether an inpatient or less restrictive alternative commitment is appropriate, great weight must be given to evidence of a prior history or pattern of decompensation and discontinuation of treatment resulting in: (a) Repeated hospitalizations; or (b) repeated peace officer interventions resulting in juvenile charges. Such evidence may be used to provide a factual basis for concluding that the minor would not receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.

8. [Empty]

   a. If the court finds that the criteria for commitment are met and that less restrictive treatment in a community setting is not appropriate or available, the court shall order the minor committed to the custody of the director for further inpatient mental health treatment, to an approved substance use disorder treatment program for further substance use disorder treatment, or to a private treatment and evaluation facility for inpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment if the minor's parents have assumed responsibility for payment for the treatment. If the court finds that a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the minor, the court shall order less restrictive alternative treatment upon such conditions as necessary.

   b. If the court determines that the minor does not meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment, the minor shall be released.

9. Successive one hundred eighty-day commitments are permissible on the same grounds and under the same procedures as the original one hundred eighty-day commitment. Such petitions shall be filed at least three days prior to the expiration of the previous one hundred eighty-day commitment order.

## 71.34.910 - Appearance by video technology.
For purposes of this chapter, at any hearing the petitioner, the respondent, the witnesses, the interpreters, and the presiding judicial officer may be present and participate either in person or by video, as determined by the court. The term "video" as used in this section includes any functional equivalent. At any hearing conducted by video, the technology used must permit the judicial officer, counsel, all parties, and the witnesses to be able to see, hear, and speak, when authorized, during the hearing; to allow attorneys to use exhibits or other materials during the hearing; and to allow the respondent's counsel to be in the same location as the respondent unless otherwise requested by the respondent or the respondent's counsel. Witnesses in a proceeding may also appear in court through other means, including telephonically, pursuant to the requirements of superior court civil rule 43. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court, upon its own motion or upon a motion for good cause by any party, may require all parties and witnesses to participate in the hearing in person rather than by video. In ruling on any such motion, the court may allow in-person or video testimony; and the court may consider, among other things, whether the respondent's alleged behavioral health disorder affects the respondent's ability to perceive or participate in the proceeding by video.
