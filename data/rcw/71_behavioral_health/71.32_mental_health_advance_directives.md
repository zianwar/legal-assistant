## 71.32.010 - Legislative declaration—Findings.
1. The legislature declares that an individual with capacity has the ability to control decisions relating to his or her own behavioral health care. The legislature finds that:

   a. Some behavioral health disorders cause individuals to fluctuate between capacity and incapacity;

   b. During periods when an individual's capacity is unclear, the individual may be unable to access needed treatment because the individual may be unable to give informed consent;

   c. Early treatment may prevent an individual from becoming so ill that involuntary treatment is necessary; and

   d. Individuals with behavioral health disorders need some method of expressing their instructions and preferences for treatment and providing advance consent to or refusal of treatment.

2. The legislature recognizes that a mental health advance directive can be an essential tool for an individual to express his or her choices at a time when the effects of a behavioral health disorder have not deprived him or her of the power to express his or her instructions or preferences.

3. The legislature further finds that:

   a. A mental health advance directive must provide the individual with a full range of choices;

   b. Individuals with behavioral health disorders have varying perspectives on whether they want to be able to revoke a directive during periods of incapacity;

   c. For a mental health advance directive to be an effective tool, individuals must be able to choose how they want their directives treated during periods of incapacity; and

   d. There must be clear standards so that treatment providers can readily discern an individual's treatment choices.

Consequently, the legislature affirms that, pursuant to other provisions of law, a validly executed mental health advance directive is to be respected by agents, guardians, and other surrogate decision makers, health care providers, professional persons, and health care facilities.

## 71.32.040 - Presumption of capacity.

   h. The principal's nomination of a guardian or limited guardian as provided in RCW 11.125.080 for consideration by the court if guardianship proceedings are commenced.

4. A directive may be combined with or be independent of a nomination of a guardian or other durable power of attorney under chapter 11.125 RCW, so long as the processes for each are executed in accordance with its own statutes.

\[ [2021 c 287 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5370-S.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20287%20§%207); [2016 c 209 § 408](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5635-S.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20209%20§%20408); [2003 c 283 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5223-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20283%20§%205); \]

3. A directive is valid upon execution, but all or part of the directive may take effect at a later time as designated by the principal in the directive.

4. A directive may:

   a. Be revoked, in whole or in part, pursuant to the provisions of RCW 71.32.080; or

4. Replace or supersede the provisions of any will or testamentary document or supersede the provisions of intestate succession;

5. Be revoked by an incapacitated principal unless that principal selected the option to permit revocation while incapacitated at the time his or her directive was executed; or

6. Be used as the authority for inpatient admission for more than 14 days in any 21 day period.

\[ [2021 c 287 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5370-S.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20287%20§%209); [2003 c 283 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5223-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20283%20§%207); \]

## 71.32.080 - Revocation—Waiver.
1. [Empty]

   a. A principal with capacity may, by written statement by the principal or at the principal's direction in the principal's presence, revoke a directive in whole or in part.

   b. An incapacitated principal may revoke a directive only if he or she elected at the time of executing the directive to be able to revoke when incapacitated.

2. The revocation need not follow any specific form so long as it is written and the intent of the principal can be discerned. In the case of a directive that is stored in the health care declarations registry created by RCW 70.122.130, the revocation may be by an online method established by the department of health. Failure to use the online method of revocation for a directive that is stored in the registry does not invalidate a revocation that is made by another method described under this section.

3. The principal shall provide a copy of his or her written statement of revocation to his or her agent, if any, and to each health care provider, professional person, or health care facility that received a copy of the directive from the principal.

4. The written statement of revocation is effective:

   a. As to a health care provider, professional person, or health care facility, upon receipt. The professional person, health care provider, or health care facility, or persons acting under their direction shall make the statement of revocation part of the principal's medical record; and

   b. As to the principal's agent, upon receipt. The principal's agent shall notify the principal's health care provider, professional person, or health care facility of the revocation and provide them with a copy of the written statement of revocation.

5. A directive also may:

   a. Be revoked, in whole or in part, expressly or to the extent of any inconsistency, by a subsequent directive; or

   b. Be superseded or revoked by a court order, including any order entered in a criminal matter. A directive may be superseded by a court order regardless of whether the order contains an explicit reference to the directive. To the extent a directive is not in conflict with a court order, the directive remains effective, subject to the provisions of RCW 71.32.150. A directive shall not be interpreted in a manner that interferes with: (i) Incarceration or detention by the department of corrections, in a city or county jail, or by the department of social and health services; or (ii) treatment of a principal who is subject to involuntary treatment pursuant to chapter 10.77, 71.05, 71.09, or 71.34 RCW.

6. A directive that would have otherwise expired but is effective because the principal is incapacitated remains effective until the principal is no longer incapacitated unless the principal has elected to be able to revoke while incapacitated and has revoked the directive.

7. When a principal with capacity consents to treatment that differs from, or refuses treatment consented to in, the provisions of his or her directive, the consent or refusal constitutes a waiver of that provision and does not constitute a revocation of the provision or directive unless the principal also revokes the directive or provision.

\[ [2016 sp.s. c 29 § 423](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1713-S3.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20sp.s.%20c%2029%20§%20423); [2006 c 108 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2342-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20108%20§%205); [2003 c 283 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5223-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20283%20§%208); \]

## 71.32.090 - Witnesses.
A witness may not be any of the following:

1. A person designated to make health care decisions on the principal's behalf;

2. A health care provider or professional person directly involved with the provision of care to the principal at the time the directive is executed;

3. An owner, operator, employee, or relative of an owner or operator of a health care facility or long-term care facility in which the principal is a patient or resident;

4. A person who is related by blood, marriage, or adoption to the person or with whom the principal has a dating relationship, as defined in RCW 7.105.010;

5. A person who is declared to be an incapacitated person; or

6. A person who would benefit financially if the principal making the directive undergoes mental health treatment.

## 71.32.100 - Appointment of agent.
1. If a directive authorizes the appointment of an agent, the provisions of chapter 11.125 RCW and RCW 7.70.065 shall apply unless otherwise stated in this chapter.

2. The principal who appoints an agent must notify the agent in writing of the appointment.

3. An agent must act in good faith.

4. An agent may make decisions on behalf of the principal. Unless the principal has revoked the directive, the decisions must be consistent with the instructions and preferences the principal has expressed in the directive, or if not expressed, as otherwise known to the agent. If the principal's instructions or preferences are not known, the agent shall make a decision he or she determines is in the best interest of the principal.

5. A person authorized to act as an agent during periods when the principal is incapacitated may act as the principal's personal representative pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act, sections 1171 through 1179 of the social security act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320d, as amended, and applicable regulations, to obtain access to the principal's health care information and communicate with the principal's health care provider. This subsection shall be construed to be consistent with chapters 70.02, 70.24, 71.05, and 71.34 RCW, and with federal law regarding health care information.

6. Unless otherwise provided in the appointment and agreed to in writing by the agent, the agent is not, as a result of acting in the capacity of agent, personally liable for the cost of treatment provided to the principal.

7. An agent may resign or withdraw at any time by giving written notice to the principal. The agent must also give written notice to any health care provider, professional person, or health care facility providing treatment to the principal. The resignation or withdrawal is effective upon receipt unless otherwise specified in the resignation or withdrawal.

8. If the directive gives the agent authority to act while the principal has capacity, the decisions of the principal supersede those of the agent at any time the principal has capacity.

9. An agent's authority terminates when an action is filed for the dissolution or annulment of the agent's marriage to the principal or for their legal separation, or an action is filed for dissolution or annulment of the agent's state registered domestic partnership with the principal or for their legal separation.

10. Unless otherwise provided in the durable power of attorney, the principal may revoke the agent's appointment as provided under other state law.

4. At least one mental health professional, substance use disorder professional, or health care provider must personally examine the principal prior to making a capacity determination.
