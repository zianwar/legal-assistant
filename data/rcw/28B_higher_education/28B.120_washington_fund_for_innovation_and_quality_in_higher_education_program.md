## 28B.120.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that encouraging collaboration among the various educational sectors to meet statewide productivity and educational attainment needs as described in the system design plan developed by the *higher education coordinating board will strengthen the entire educational system, kindergarten through twelfth grade and higher education. The legislature also recognizes that the most effective way to develop innovative and collaborative programs is to encourage institutions to develop them voluntarily, in line with established state goals. Through a system of competitive grants, the legislature shall encourage the development of innovative and collaborative and cost-effective solutions to issues of critical statewide need, including:

1. Raising educational attainment and planning and piloting innovative initiatives to reach new locations and populations;

2. Recognizing needs of special populations of students, including access and completion efforts targeting underrepresented populations;

3. Furthering the development of learner-centered, technology-assisted course delivery, including expansion of online and hybrid coursework, open courseware, and other uses of technology in order to effectively and efficiently share costs, improve the quality of instruction and student, faculty, and administrative services, increase undergraduate and graduate student access, retention, and graduation, and to enhance transfer capability;

4. Furthering the development of competency-based measurements of student achievement to be used as the basis for awarding degrees and certificates;

5. Increasing the collaboration among both public and private sector institutions of higher education; and

6. Improving productivity through innovations such as accelerated programs and alternative scheduling.

## 28B.120.010 - Washington fund for innovation and quality in higher education program—Incentive grants.
The Washington fund for innovation and quality in higher education program is established. The student achievement council shall administer the program and shall work in close collaboration with the state board for community and technical colleges and other local and regional entities. Through this program the student achievement council may award on a competitive basis incentive grants to state public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education or consortia of institutions to encourage programs designed to address specific system problems. Each institution or consortia of institutions receiving the award shall contribute some financial support, either by covering part of the costs for the program during its implementation, or by assuming continuing support at the end of the grant period. Strong priority will be given to proposals that involve more than one sector of education. Institutions are encouraged to solicit nonstate funds to support these cooperative programs.
