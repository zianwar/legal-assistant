## 28B.10.037 - Student expression in school-sponsored media.
1. Students at institutions of higher education have the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press in school-sponsored media, whether or not the media are supported financially by the school or by use of school facilities, or are produced in conjunction with a class. All school-sponsored media produced primarily by students at an institution of higher education are public forums for expression by the student journalists and student editors at the particular institution. Student media, whether school-sponsored or nonschool sponsored, are not subject to mandatory prior review by school officials.

2. Student editors of school-sponsored media are responsible for determining the news, opinion, feature, and advertising content of the media. This subsection does not prevent a student media adviser from teaching professional standards of English and journalism to the student journalists. A student media adviser may not be terminated, transferred, removed, or otherwise disciplined for refusing to suppress the protected free expression rights of student journalists.

3. Nothing in this section may be interpreted to authorize expression by students that:

   a. Is libelous or slanderous;

   b. Constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy;

   c. Violates the federal communications act or any rule or regulation of the federal communications commission; or

   d. So incites students as to create a clear and present danger of:

      i. The commission of unlawful acts on school premises;

      ii. The violation of lawful school regulations, policies, or procedures; or

      iii. The material and substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the school. A school official must base a forecast of material and substantial disruption on specific facts, including past experience in the school and current events influencing student behavior, and not on undifferentiated fear or apprehension.

4. Any student enrolled in an institution of higher education may commence a civil action to obtain appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief as determined by a court for a violation of subsection (1) of this section by the institution of higher education. Upon a motion, a court may award reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff in a civil action brought under this section.

5. Expression made by students in school-sponsored media is not the expression of school policy. Neither a school official nor the governing board of any institution of higher education may be held responsible in any civil or criminal action for any expression made or published by students in school-sponsored media unless school officials or the governing board have interfered with or altered the content of the student expression.

6. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "School-sponsored media" means any matter that is prepared, substantially written, published, or broadcast by student journalists, that is distributed or generally made available, either free of charge or for a fee, to members of the student body, and that is prepared under the direction of a student media adviser. "School-sponsored media" does not include media that is intended for distribution or transmission solely in the classrooms in which they are produced.

   b. "Student journalist" means a student who gathers, compiles, writes, edits, photographs, records, or prepares information for dissemination in school-sponsored media.

   c. "Student media adviser" means a person who is employed, appointed, or designated by the school to supervise, or provide instruction relating to, school-sponsored media.

   a. With regard to courses in which the person is enrolled, the person may:

      i. Withdraw from one or more courses for which tuition and fees have been paid that are attributable to the courses. The tuition and fees must be credited to the person's account at the institution. Any refunds are subject to the requirements of the state or federal financial aid programs of origination. In such a case, the student shall not receive credit for the courses and shall not receive a failing grade, an incomplete, or other negative annotation on the student's record, and the student's grade point average shall not be altered or affected in any manner because of action under this item;

      ii. Be given a grade of incomplete and be allowed to complete the course upon release from active duty under the institution's standard practice for completion of incompletes; or

Class sessions the student misses due to performance of state or federal active military service must be counted as excused absences and must not be used in any way to adversely impact the student's grade or standing in the class. Any student who selects this option is not, however, automatically excused from completing assignments due during the period the student is performing state or federal active military service. A letter grade or a grade of pass must only be awarded if, in the opinion of the faculty member teaching the course, the student has completed sufficient work and has demonstrated sufficient progress toward meeting course requirements to justify the grade;

   b. To receive a refund of amounts paid for room, board, and fees attributable to the time period during which the student was serving in state or federal active military service and did not use the facilities or services for which the amounts were paid. Any refund of room, board, and fees is subject to the requirements of the state or federal financial aid programs of origination; and

The makeup must be scheduled after the member's return from service and after a reasonable time for the student to prepare for the test, examination, laboratory, presentation, or event.

   b. Class sessions a student misses due to performance of state or federal active or inactive military service must be counted as excused absences and may not be used in any way to adversely impact the student's grade or standing in class.

   c. If the faculty member teaching the course determines that the student has completed sufficient work and has demonstrated sufficient progress toward meeting course requirements to justify the grade without making up the class, test, examination, presentation, or other event, the grade may be awarded without the makeup, but the missed class, test, examination, laboratory, class day, presentation, or other event must not be used in any way to adversely impact the student's grade or standing in the class.

3. The protections in this section may be invoked as follows:

   a. The person, or an appropriate officer from the military organization in which the person will be serving, must give written notice that the person is being, or has been, ordered to qualifying service; and

For employees who are first employed by an institution of higher education in a position eligible for participation in an old age annuities or retirement income plan under this chapter prior to July 1, 2011, it is the intent of RCW 28B.10.400, 28B.10.405, 28B.10.410, 28B.10.415, and 28B.10.420 and this section that the retirement income resulting from the contributions described herein from the state of Washington and the employee shall be projected actuarially so that it shall not exceed sixty percent of the average of the highest two consecutive years salary. Periodic review of the retirement systems established pursuant to RCW 28B.10.400, 28B.10.405, 28B.10.410, 28B.10.415, and 28B.10.420 and this section will be undertaken at such time and in such manner as determined by the committees on ways and means of the senate and of the house of representatives, the select committee on pension policy, and the pension funding council, and joint contribution rates will be adjusted if necessary to accomplish this intent.

2. Beginning July 1, 2011, state funding for annuity or retirement income plans under RCW 28B.10.400 shall not exceed six percent of salary. The state board for community and technical colleges and the student achievement council are exempt from the provisions of this subsection (2).

3. By June 30, 2013, and every two years thereafter, each institution of higher education that is responsible for payment of supplemental amounts under RCW 28B.10.400(1)(c) shall contract with the state actuary under chapter 41.44 RCW for an actuarial valuation of their supplemental benefit plan. By June 30, 2013, and at least once every six years thereafter, each institution shall also contract with the state actuary under chapter 41.44 RCW for an actuarial experience study of the mortality, service, compensation, and other experience of the annuity or retirement income plans created in this chapter, and into the financial condition of each system. At the discretion of the state actuary, the valuation or experience study may be performed by the state actuary or by an outside actuarial firm under contract to the office of the state actuary. Each institution of higher education is required to provide the data and information required for the performance of the valuation or experience study to the office of the state actuary or to the actuary performing the study on behalf of the state actuary. The state actuary may charge each institution for the actual cost of the valuation or experience study through an interagency agreement. Upon completion of the valuation or experience study, the state actuary shall provide copies of the study to the institution of higher education and to the select committee on pension policy and the pension funding council.

4. [Empty]

   a. From January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2013, an employer contribution rate of one-quarter of one percent of salary is established to begin prefunding the unfunded future obligations of the supplemental benefit established in RCW 28B.10.400.

   b. Beginning July 1, 2013, an employer contribution rate of one-half of one percent of salary is established to prefund the unfunded future obligations of the supplemental benefit established in RCW 28B.10.400.

   c. [Empty]

      i. Beginning July 1, 2020, the employer contribution rates for each state institution of higher education are as follows:

University of Washington: 0.38 percent

Washington State University: 0.30 percent

Western Washington University: 0.21 percent

Eastern Washington University: 0.28 percent

Central Washington University: 0.28 percent

The Evergreen State College: 0.23 percent

State board for community and technical colleges: 0.13 percent

      ii. The contribution rates established in this section may be changed by rates adopted by the pension funding council beginning July 1, 2021, consistent with (e) of this subsection.

      iii. The rates in this subsection (4) are subject to the limit established in subsection (2) of this section.

   d. Consistent with chapter 41.50 RCW, the department of retirement systems shall collect the employer contribution rates established in this section from each state institution of higher education, and deposit those contributions into the higher education retirement plan supplemental benefit fund under RCW 41.50.075(6). The contributions made by each employer into the higher education retirement plan supplemental benefit fund and the earnings on those contributions shall be accounted for separately within the fund.

   e. Following the completion and review of the actuarial valuations and experience study conducted pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the pension funding council may, by July 31, 2020, and every two years thereafter, adopt and make changes to the employer contribution rates established in this subsection consistent with the procedures established in chapter 41.45 RCW. If the actuarial valuations of the higher education retirement plans of each institution contributing to the higher education retirement plan supplemental benefit fund suggest that different contribution rates are appropriate for each institution, different rates may be adopted. Rates adopted by the pension funding council are subject to revision by the legislature.

   f. [Empty]

      i. The rates adopted by the pension funding council must be designed to keep the cost of the higher education retirement plan supplemental benefits at a more level percentage of pay than a pay-as-you-go method. This more level percentage of pay of costs means a combination of the cost of supplemental benefits paid by the institution directly, plus the cost of contributions to the higher education retirement plan supplemental benefit fund. Contributions shall continue until the projected value of the funds equals the projected cost of future benefits for the institution.

      ii. Funds are anticipated to be accumulated in the higher education retirement plan supplemental benefit fund, and not expended on benefits until approximately the year 2035.

      iii. The pension funding council, in consultation with the state actuary, may choose and occasionally revise, a funding method designed to achieve these objectives.

1. This section applies only to those persons who are first employed by an institution of higher education in a position eligible for participation in an old age annuities or retirement income plan under this chapter prior to July 1, 2011.

2. For any person receiving a monthly benefit pursuant to a program established under RCW 28B.10.400, the pension portion of such benefit shall be the sum of the following amounts:

   a. One-half of the monthly benefit payable under such program by a life insurance company; and

   b. The monthly equivalent of the supplemental benefit described in RCW 28B.10.400(1)(c).

3. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, effective July 1, 1979, no person receiving a monthly benefit pursuant to RCW 28B.10.400 shall receive, as the pension portion of that benefit, less than ten dollars per month for each year of service creditable to the person whose service is the basis of the benefit. Portions of a year shall be treated as fractions of a year and the decimal equivalent shall be multiplied by ten dollars. Where the benefit was adjusted at the time benefit payments to the beneficiary commenced, the minimum pension provided in this section shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with that adjustment.

4. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, effective July 1, 1979, the monthly benefit of each person who commenced receiving a monthly benefit under this chapter as of a date no later than July 1, 1974, shall be permanently increased by a post-retirement adjustment. Such adjustment shall be calculated as follows:

   a. Monthly benefits to which this subsection and subsection (3) of this section are both applicable shall be determined by first applying subsection (3) of this section and then applying this subsection. The institution shall determine the total years of creditable service and the total dollar benefit base accrued as of December 31, 1978, except that this determination shall take into account only those persons to whom this subsection applies;

   b. The institution shall multiply the total benefits determined in (a) of this subsection by six percent and divide the dollar value thus determined by the total service determined in (a) of this subsection. The resultant figure shall then be a post-retirement increase factor which shall be applied as specified in (c) of this subsection;

   c. Each person to whom this subsection applies shall receive an increase which is the product of the factor determined in (b) of this subsection multiplied by the years of creditable service.

A graduate who has earned the direct transfer associate of arts degree will be deemed to have met the lower division general education requirements of the receiving four-year institution of higher education. A graduate who has earned the associate of science transfer degree will be deemed to have met most requirements that prepare the graduate for baccalaureate degree majors in science, technology, engineering, and math and will be required to complete only such additional lower division, general education courses at the receiving four-year institutions of higher education as would have been required to complete the direct transfer associate of arts degree.

2. A student who has earned the equivalent of ninety quarter credit hours and has completed the general education requirements at that four-year institution of higher education in Washington when admitted to another four-year institution of higher education shall have junior standing and shall be deemed to have met the lower division general education requirements of the institution to which the student transfers.

3. The community and technical colleges, jointly with the four-year institutions of higher education, must develop a list of academic courses that are equivalent to one-year's worth of general education credit and that would transfer for that purpose to any other two or four-year institution of higher education. If a student completes one-year's worth of general education credits, the student may be issued a one-year academic completion certificate. This certificate shall be accepted at any transferring two or four-year institution of higher education.

4. Each institution of higher education must develop a minimum of one degree within the arts and sciences disciplines that can be completed within the equivalent of ninety quarter upper-division credits by any student who enters an institution of higher education with junior status and lower division general education requirements completed.

5. Each four-year institution of higher education must publish a list of recommended courses for each academic major designed to help students who are planning to transfer design their course of study. Publication of the list of courses must be easily identified and accessible on the institution's website.

6. The requirements to publish a list of recommended courses for each academic major under this section does not apply if an institution does not require courses or majors to meet specific requirements but generally applies credits earned towards degree requirements.
