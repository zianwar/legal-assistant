## 28B.20.298 - Clean energy research, development, manufacturing, and marketing—Findings—Policy.
1. The legislature finds that Washington state currently derives many benefits from its renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. These sectors are an important source of employment and income for a significant number of Washington residents, currently generating close to one billion dollars in annual revenue and employing over three thousand eight hundred people. Equally important, energy efficiency and renewable energy businesses add to the region's quality of life by employing technologies that can reduce some of the harmful effects of the reliance on fossil fuels. Washington state possesses all the necessary elements to do much more to develop these sectors and to become a national leader in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of clean energy technologies and services. The state's workforce is highly educated; the state's higher education institutions are supportive of clean energy research and cooperate closely with the private sector in developing and deploying new energy technologies; there are numerous enterprises already located in the state that are engaged in clean energy research and development; and the state's citizens, utilities, and governmental sectors at all levels are committed to diversifying the state's energy sources and increasing energy efficiency.

2. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the state that its public agencies and institutions of higher learning maximize their efforts collectively and cooperatively with the private sector to establish the state as a leader in clean energy research, development, manufacturing, and marketing. To this end, all state agencies are directed to employ their existing authorities and responsibilities to:

   a. Work with local organizations and energy companies to facilitate the development and implementation of workable renewable energy and energy efficiency projects;

   b. Actively promote policies that support energy efficiency and renewable energy development;

   c. Encourage utilities and customer groups to invest in new renewables and products and services that promote energy efficiency; and

   d. Assist in the development of stronger markets for renewables and products and services that promote energy efficiency.

3. For the purposes of this section and *RCW 28B.20.296 and for *RCW 28B.20.285 and 28B.20.287, energy efficiency shall include the application of digital technologies to the generation, delivery, and use of power.

At least once a year, the university shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation and with the office of minority and women's business enterprises, a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit a statement of qualifications from contractors who wish to be on the roster or rosters of prime contractors. In addition, qualified contractors shall be added to the roster or rosters at any time they submit a written request, necessary records, and meet the qualifications established by the university. The university may require eligible contractors desiring to be placed on a roster to keep current records of any applicable licenses, certifications, registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with the university with input from the women-owned and minority-owned business community as a condition of being placed on a roster or rosters.

   c. The contractor's ability to meet time and budget requirements;

   d. The contractor's ability to provide preconstruction services, as appropriate;

   e. The contractor's capacity to successfully complete the project;

   f. The contractor's approach to executing projects;

   g. The contractor's approach to safety and the contractor's safety history;

   h. The contractor's record of performance, integrity, judgment, and skills;

   i. The contractor's record of including office of minority and women's business enterprises-certified, minority, women, veteran, and small businesses; and

The contractor's past history of use of small business entities, disadvantaged business enterprises, minority business enterprises, women business enterprises, and minority women business enterprises over the last five years on projects of five million dollars or less and the contractor's proposed outreach plan and commitment to include such firms.

5. Contractors meeting the evaluation committee's criteria for selection must be placed on the applicable roster or rosters.

6. When a project is selected for delivery through this roster process, the university must establish a procedure for securing written quotations from all contractors on a roster to assure that a competitive price is established. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. Plans and specifications must be included in the invitation but may not be detailed. Award of a project must be made to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid.

7. The university shall make an effort to solicit proposals from certified minority or certified woman-owned contractors. The university business diversity program shall establish aspirational goals for small business entities, disadvantaged business enterprises, minority business enterprises, women business enterprises, and minority women business enterprises for each roster based on the projected subcontracting opportunities and to the extent permitted by the Washington state civil rights act, RCW 49.60.400.

8. Beginning in September 2010 and every other September thereafter, the university shall provide a report to the capital projects advisory review board which must, at a minimum, include a list of rosters used, contracts awarded, office of minority and women's business enterprises-certified small business entities, disadvantaged business enterprises, veterans, and women and minority-owned business use rates on the projects.

9. Beginning in September 2015 and every September thereafter, the university shall report to the office of minority and women's business enterprises and to the appropriate legislative fiscal committees the number of qualified women and minority-owned business contractors on the roster or rosters and the number of contracts awarded to women and minority-owned businesses.
