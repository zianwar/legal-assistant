## 28B.45.010 - Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that the benefits of higher education should be more widely available to the citizens of the state of Washington. The legislature also finds that a citizen's place of residence can restrict that citizen's access to educational opportunity at the upper-division and graduate level.

Because most of the state-supported baccalaureate universities are located in areas removed from major metropolitan areas, the legislature finds that many of the state's citizens, especially those citizens residing in the central Puget Sound area, the Tri-Cities, Spokane, Vancouver, and Yakima, have insufficient and inequitable access to upper-division baccalaureate and graduate education.

This lack of sufficient educational opportunities in urban areas makes it difficult or impossible for place-bound individuals, who are unable to relocate, to complete a baccalaureate or graduate degree. It also exacerbates the difficulty financially needy students have in attending school, since many of those students need to work, and work is not always readily available in some communities where the baccalaureate institutions of higher education are located.

The lack of sufficient educational opportunities in metropolitan areas also affects the economy of the underserved communities. Businesses benefit from access to the research and teaching capabilities of institutions of higher education. The absence of these institutions from some of the state's major urban centers prevents beneficial interaction between businesses in these communities and the state's universities.

The Washington state master plan for higher education, adopted by the *higher education coordinating board, recognizes the need to expand upper-division and graduate educational opportunities in the state's large urban centers. The board has also attempted to provide a means for helping to meet future educational demand through a system of campuses in the state's major urban areas.

The legislature endorses the assignment of responsibility to serve these urban centers that the board has made to various institutions of higher education. The legislature also endorses the creation of campuses for the University of Washington and Washington State University.

The legislature recognizes that, among their other responsibilities, the state's comprehensive community colleges share with the four-year universities and colleges the responsibility of providing the first two years of a baccalaureate education. It is the intent of the legislature that the four-year institutions and the community colleges work as cooperative partners to ensure the successful and efficient operation of the state's system of higher education. The legislature further intends that the four-year institutions work cooperatively with the community colleges to ensure that the campuses created under this chapter are operated as models of a two plus two educational system.

## 28B.45.012 - Findings—Intent.
1. In 1989, the legislature created five campuses to be operated by the state's two public research universities. Located in growing urban areas, the campuses were charged with two missions:

   a. Increasing access to higher education by focusing on upper-division and graduate programs, targeting placebound students, and operating as models of a two plus two educational system in cooperation with the community colleges; and

   b. Promoting regional economic development by responding to demand for degrees from local businesses and supporting regional economies through research activities.

2. Fifteen years later, the legislature finds that the campuses are responding to their original mission:

   a. The campuses accounted for half of statewide upper-division and graduate public enrollment growth since 1990;

   b. The campuses have grown steadily and enroll increasing numbers of transfer students each year;

   c. The campuses enroll proportionately more older and part-time students than their main campuses and attract increasing proportions of students from nearby counties;

   d. Although the extent of their impact has not been measured, these campuses positively affect local economies and offer degree programs that roughly correspond with regional occupational projections; and

   e. The capital investments made by the state to support the campuses represent a significant benefit to regional economic development.

3. However, the legislature also finds the policy landscape in higher education has changed since the original creation of the campuses. Demand for access to baccalaureate and graduate education is increasing rapidly. Economic development efforts increasingly recognize the importance of focusing on local and regional economic clusters and improving collaboration among communities, businesses, and colleges and universities. Each campus has evolved into a unique institution, and it is appropriate to assess the nature of this evolution to ensure the role and mission of each campus is aligned with the state's higher education goals and the needs of the region where the campus is located.

4. Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to recognize the unique nature of Washington's higher education campuses created under this chapter, reaffirm the role and mission of each, and set the course for their continued future development.

5. It is the further intent of the legislature that the campuses be identified by the following names: University of Washington Bothell, University of Washington Tacoma, Washington State University Tri-Cities, and Washington State University Vancouver.

## 28B.45.014 - Mission—Collaboration with community and technical colleges—Alternative models—Monitoring and evaluation—Reports to the legislature.
1. The primary mission of the higher education campuses created under this chapter remains to expand access to baccalaureate and graduate education in underserved urban areas of the state in collaboration with community and technical colleges. The top priority for each of the campuses is to expand courses and degree programs for transfer and graduate students. New degree programs should be driven by the educational needs and demands of students and the community, as well as the economic development needs of local businesses and employers.

2. The campuses created under this chapter shall collaborate with the community and technical colleges in their region to develop articulation agreements, dual admissions policies, and other partnerships to ensure that the campuses serve as innovative models of a two plus two educational system. Other possibilities for collaboration include but are not limited to joint development of curricula and degree programs, colocation of instruction, and arrangements to share faculty.

3. In communities where a private postsecondary institution is located, representatives of the private institution may be invited to participate in the conversation about meeting the baccalaureate and graduate needs in underserved urban areas of the state.

4. However, the legislature recognizes there are alternative models for achieving this primary mission. Some campuses may have additional missions in response to regional needs and demands. At selected campuses, an innovative combination of instruction and research targeted to support regional economic development may be appropriate to meet the region's needs for both access and economic viability. Other campuses should focus on becoming models of a two plus two educational system through continuous improvement of partnerships and agreements with community and technical colleges. Still other campuses may be best suited to transition to a four-year university.

5. The legislature recognizes that size, mix of degree programs, and proportion of lower versus upper-division and graduate enrollments are factors that affect costs at the campuses. However over time, the legislature intends that the campuses be funded more similarly to regional universities.

6. Research universities are authorized to develop doctoral degree programs at their campuses.

7. The student achievement council shall monitor and evaluate growth of the campuses and periodically report and make recommendations to the higher education committees of the legislature to ensure the campuses continue to follow the priorities established under this chapter.

## 28B.45.020 - University of Washington Tacoma—University of Washington Bothell.
1. The University of Washington is responsible for ensuring the expansion of baccalaureate and graduate educational programs in the central Puget Sound area under rules or guidelines adopted by the student achievement council and in accordance with proportionality agreements emphasizing access for transfer students developed with the state board for community and technical colleges. The University of Washington shall meet that responsibility through the operation of at least two campuses. One campus shall be located in the Tacoma area. Another campus shall be collocated with Cascadia Community College in the Bothell-Woodinville area.

2. At the University of Washington Tacoma, a top priority is expansion of upper-division capacity for transfer students and graduate capacity and programs.

## 28B.45.0201 - Findings.
The legislature finds that population growth in north King and south Snohomish counties has created a need to expand higher education and workforce training programs for the people living and working in those areas. In keeping with the recommendations of the *higher education coordinating board, the legislature intends to help address those education and training needs through the creation of Cascadia Community College, expansion of educational opportunities at Lake Washington Institute of Technology, and support of the University of Washington's campus at Bothell-Woodinville. It is further the intention of the legislature, in keeping with the *higher education coordinating board recommendations, that the Cascadia Community College and the University of Washington Bothell-Woodinville campus be collocated, and that the new community college and the University of Washington's Bothell-Woodinville campus work in partnership to ensure that properly prepared students from community colleges and other institutions are able to transfer smoothly to the Bothell-Woodinville campus.

The legislature further finds that a governing board for Cascadia Community College needs to be appointed and confirmed as expeditiously as possible. The legislature intends to work cooperatively with the governor to facilitate the appointment and confirmation of trustees for the college.
