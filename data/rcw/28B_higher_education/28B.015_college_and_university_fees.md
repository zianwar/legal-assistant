   b. A person does not lose a domicile in the state of Washington by reason of residency in any state or country while a member of the civil or military service of this state or of the United States, nor while engaged in the navigation of the waters of this state or of the United States or of the high seas if that person returns to the state of Washington within one year of discharge from said service with the intent to be domiciled in the state of Washington; any resident dependent student who remains in this state when such student's parents, having theretofore been domiciled in this state for a period of one year immediately prior to the time of commencement of the first day of the semester or quarter for which the student has registered at any institution, remove from this state, shall be entitled to continued classification as a resident student so long as such student's attendance (except summer sessions) at an institution in this state is continuous.

3. To aid the institution in deciding whether a student, parent, legally appointed guardian or the person having legal custody of a student is domiciled in the state of Washington primarily for purposes other than educational, the rules adopted by the student achievement council shall include but not be limited to the following:

   a. Registration or payment of Washington taxes or fees on a motor vehicle, mobile home, travel trailer, boat, or any other item of personal property owned or used by the person for which state registration or the payment of a state tax or fee is required will be a factor in considering evidence of the establishment of a Washington domicile.

   b. Permanent full time employment in Washington by a person will be a factor in considering the establishment of a Washington domicile.

   c. Registration to vote for state officials in Washington will be a factor in considering the establishment of a Washington domicile.

4. After a student has registered at an institution such student's classification shall remain unchanged in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary. A student wishing to apply for a change in classification shall reduce such evidence to writing and file it with the institution. In any case involving an application for a change from nonresident to resident status, the burden of proof shall rest with the applicant. Any change in classification, either nonresident to resident, or the reverse, shall be based upon written evidence maintained in the files of the institution and, if approved, shall take effect the semester or quarter such evidence was filed with the institution: PROVIDED, That applications for a change in classification shall be accepted up to the thirtieth calendar day following the first day of instruction of the quarter or semester for which application is made.

Such lawful agreements include, but are not limited to, bond covenant agreements and other contractual obligations. Institutional governing boards are also expected to protect the stability of programs that benefit students.

It is the intent of the legislature that governing boards ensure that students have a strong voice in recommending budgets for services and activities fees. The boards of trustees and the boards of regents of the respective institutions of higher education shall adopt guidelines governing the establishment and funding of programs supported by services and activities fees. Such guidelines shall stipulate procedures for budgeting and expending services and activities fee revenue. Any such guidelines shall be consistent with the following provisions:

1. Student representatives from the services and activities fee committee and representatives of the college or university administration shall have an opportunity to address the board before board decisions on services and activities fee budgets and dispute resolution actions are made.

Responsibility for proposing to the administration and the governing board program priorities and budget levels for that portion of program budgets that derive from services and activities fees shall reside with a services and activities fee committee, on which students shall hold at least a majority of the voting memberships, such student members shall represent diverse student interests, and shall be recommended by the student government association or its equivalent. The chairperson of the services and activities fee committee shall be selected by the members of that committee. The governing board shall insure that the services and activities fee committee provides an opportunity for all viewpoints to be heard at a public meeting during its consideration of the funding of student programs and activities.

4. The services and activities fee committee shall evaluate existing and proposed programs and submit budget recommendations for the expenditure of those services and activities fees with supporting documents simultaneously to the college or university governing board and administration.

5. The college or university administration shall review the services and activities fee committee budget recommendations and publish a written response to the services and activities fee committee. This response shall outline potential areas of difference between the committee recommendations and the administration's proposed budget recommendations. This response, with supporting documentation, shall be submitted to the services and activities fee committee in a timely manner to allow adequate consideration.

6. [Empty]

7. The dispute resolution committee shall be selected as follows: The college or university administration shall appoint two nonvoting advisory members; the governing board shall appoint three voting members; and the services and activities fee committee chair shall appoint three student members of the services and activities fee committee who will have a vote, and one student representing the services and activities fee committee who will chair the dispute resolution committee and be nonvoting. The committee shall meet in good faith, and settle by vote any and all disputes. In the event of a tie vote, the chair of the dispute resolution committee shall vote to settle the dispute.

8. The governing board may take action on those portions of the services and activities fee budget not in dispute in accordance with the customary budget approval timeline established by the board. The governing board shall consider the results, if any, of the dispute resolution committee and shall take action.

9. Services and activities fees and revenues generated by programs and activities funded by such fees shall be deposited and expended through the office of the chief fiscal officer of the institution.

10. Services and activities fees and revenues generated by programs and activities funded by such fees shall be subject to the applicable policies, regulations, and procedures of the institution and the budget and accounting act, chapter 43.88 RCW.

11. All information pertaining to services and activities fees budgets shall be made available to interested parties. Annually, by September 30th, the services and activities fees committee at each institution of higher education, in coordination with the administration of the institution of higher education, shall post services and activities fees expenditure information for the prior academic year on the college or university website so that the information is clearly visible and easily accessible to students and the public. At a minimum, the services and activities fees budget information must include all the major categories of expenditure and the amounts expended in each category.

12. With the exception of any funds needed for bond covenant obligations, once the budget for expending service and activities fees is approved by the governing board, funds shall not be shifted from funds budgeted for associated students or departmentally related categories or the reserve fund until the administration provides written justification to the services and activities fee committee and the governing board, and the governing board and the services and activities fee committee give their express approval. In the event of a fund transfer dispute among the services and activities fee committee, the administration, or the governing board, said dispute shall be resolved pursuant to subsections (6)(b), (7), and (8) of this section.

13. Any service and activities fees collected which exceed initially budgeted amounts are subject to subsections (1) through (10) and (12) of this section.

2. Revenue from this fee shall be used exclusively for technology resources for general student use.

3. Only changes in the amount of the student technology fee agreed upon by both the governing board and its respective student government association or its equivalent shall be used to adjust the amount charged to students. Changes in the amount charged to students, once implemented, become the basis for future changes.

4. Annually, the student government association or its equivalent may abolish the fee by a majority vote. In the event of such a vote, the student government association or its equivalent shall notify the governing board of the institution. The fee shall cease being collected the term after the student government association or its equivalent voted to eliminate the fee.

Where possible, an existing budget or advisory committee shall be designated instead of establishing a new committee. When establishing evaluation criteria, the committee shall consider including the following:

      i. The financial health and sustainability of the program;

      ii. If moving the program to a self-supporting funding basis alters the availability of student financial aid;

      iii. The audience for the program, the format of the program, and the institutional priority for state funding of the program;

Attainment of an excellent education is facilitated when communication is clear, concise, sensitive to cultural differences, and demonstrative of proven pedagogical skills. It is the further intent of the legislature to assure students and parents that graduate teaching assistants at our state institutions of higher education are able to communicate effectively and understandably with undergraduate students.

## 28B.15.820 - Institutional financial aid fund—"Eligible student" defined.
1. Each institution of higher education, including technical colleges, shall deposit a minimum of three and one-half percent of revenues collected from tuition and services and activities fees in an institutional financial aid fund that is hereby created and which shall be held locally. Moneys in the fund shall be used only for the following purposes: (a) To make guaranteed long-term loans to eligible students as provided in subsections (3) through (8) of this section; (b) to make short-term loans as provided in subsection (9) of this section; (c) to provide financial aid to students who demonstrate financial need as provided in subsection (10) of this section; or (d) to provide financial aid to students as provided in subsection (11) of this section.

2. An "eligible student" for the purposes of subsections (3) through (8) and (10) of this section is a student registered for at least three credit hours or the equivalent, who is eligible for resident tuition and fee rates as defined in RCW 28B.15.012 and 28B.15.013, and who is a student who demonstrates financial need as defined in RCW 28B.92.030.

3. The amount of the guaranteed long-term loans made under this section shall not exceed the demonstrated financial need of the student. Each institution shall establish loan terms and conditions which shall be consistent with the terms of the guaranteed loan program established by 20 U.S. Code Section 1071 et seq., as now or hereafter amended. All loans made shall be guaranteed by the Washington student loan guaranty association or its successor agency. Institutions are hereby granted full authority to operate as an eligible lender under the guaranteed loan program.

4. Before approving a guaranteed long-term loan, each institution shall analyze the ability of the student to repay the loan based on factors which include, but are not limited to, the student's accumulated total education loan burdens and the employment opportunities and average starting salary characteristics of the student's chosen fields of study. The institution shall counsel the student on the advisability of acquiring additional debt, and on the availability of other forms of financial aid.

5. Each institution is responsible for collection of guaranteed long-term loans made under this section and shall exercise due diligence in such collection, maintaining all necessary records to insure that maximum repayments are made. Institutions shall cooperate with other lenders and the Washington student loan guaranty association, or its successor agency, in the coordinated collection of guaranteed loans, and shall assure that the guarantability of the loans is not violated. Collection and servicing of guaranteed long-term loans under this section shall be performed by entities approved for such servicing by the Washington student loan guaranty association or its successor agency: PROVIDED, That institutions be permitted to perform such servicing if specifically recognized to do so by the Washington student loan guaranty association or its successor agency. Collection and servicing of guaranteed long-term loans made by community colleges under subsection (1) of this section shall be coordinated by the state board for community and technical colleges and shall be conducted under procedures adopted by the state board.

6. Receipts from payment of interest or principal or any other subsidies to which institutions as lenders are entitled, that are paid by or on behalf of borrowers of funds under subsections (3) through (8) of this section, shall be deposited in each institution's financial aid fund and shall be used to cover the costs of making the guaranteed long-term loans under this section and maintaining necessary records and making collections under subsection (5) of this section: PROVIDED, That such costs shall not exceed five percent of aggregate outstanding loan principal. Institutions shall maintain accurate records of such costs, and all receipts beyond those necessary to pay such costs, shall be deposited in the institution's financial aid fund.

7. The governing boards of the state universities, the regional universities, and The Evergreen State College, and the state board for community and technical colleges, on behalf of the community colleges and technical colleges, shall each adopt necessary rules and regulations to implement this section.

8. First priority for any guaranteed long-term loans made under this section shall be directed toward students who would not normally have access to educational loans from private financial institutions in Washington state, and maximum use shall be made of secondary markets in the support of loan consolidation.

9. Short-term loans, not to exceed one year, may be made from the institutional financial aid fund to students enrolled in the institution. No such loan shall be made to any student who is known by the institution to be in default or delinquent in the payment of any outstanding student loan. A short-term loan may be made only if the institution has ample evidence that the student has the capability of repaying the loan within the time frame specified by the institution for repayment.

10. Any moneys deposited in the institutional financial aid fund that are not used in making long-term or short-term loans may be used by the institution for locally administered financial aid programs for students who demonstrate financial need, such as need-based institutional employment programs or need-based tuition and fee scholarship or grant programs. These funds shall be used in addition to and not to replace institutional funds that would otherwise support these locally administered financial aid programs. First priority in the use of these funds shall be given to students who demonstrate financial need who have accumulated excessive educational loan burdens. An excessive educational loan burden is a burden that will be difficult to repay given employment opportunities and average starting salaries in the student's chosen fields of study. Second priority in the use of these funds shall be given to single parents who are students who demonstrate financial need, to assist these students with their educational expenses, including expenses associated with child care and transportation.

11. Any moneys deposited in the institutional financial aid fund may be used by the institution for a locally administered financial aid program for high school students enrolled in dual credit programs. If institutions use funds in this manner, the governing boards of the state universities, the regional universities, The Evergreen State College, and the state board for community and technical colleges shall each adopt necessary rules to implement this subsection. Moneys from this fund may be used for all educational expenses related to a student's participation in a dual credit program including but not limited to tuition, fees, course materials, and transportation.
