   a. Being in physical proximity to a protected individual or following a protected individual;

   b. Directly or indirectly contacting or communicating with a protected individual or other individual described in the order;

   c. Being within a certain distance of a specified place or location associated with a protected individual; or

2. Presentation to a law enforcement officer of a record of a Canadian domestic violence protection order that identifies both a protected individual and a respondent, and on its face is in effect, constitutes probable cause to believe that an enforceable order exists.

4. If a law enforcement officer determines that a Canadian domestic violence protection order cannot be enforced because the respondent has not been notified of or served with the order, the officer shall notify the protected individual that the officer will make reasonable efforts to contact the respondent, consistent with the safety of the protected individual. After notice to the protected individual and consistent with the safety of the individual, the officer shall make a reasonable effort to inform the respondent of the order, notify the respondent of the terms of the order, provide a record of the order, if available, to the respondent, and allow the respondent a reasonable opportunity to comply with the order before the officer enforces the order.
