   b. Its order is not the controlling order.

## 26.21A.130 - Determination of controlling child support order.
1. If a proceeding is brought under this chapter and only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.

2. If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and two or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of this state, or another state, or a foreign country with regard to the same obligor and same child, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which order controls and must be recognized:

   a. If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the order of that tribunal controls.

   b. If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter:

      i. An order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls; or

      ii. If an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls.

   c. If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the tribunal of this state shall issue a child support order, which controls.

3. If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (2) of this section. The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification pursuant to Article 6 of this chapter, or may be filed as a separate proceeding.

4. A request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.

5. The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (1), (2), or (3) of this section has continuing jurisdiction to the extent provided in RCW 26.21A.120 or 26.21A.125.

6. A tribunal of this state that determines by order which is the controlling order under subsection (2)(a) or (b) or (3) of this section or that issues a new controlling order under subsection (2)(c) of this section shall state in that order:

   a. The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination;

   b. The amount of prospective support, if any; and

   c. The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited as provided by RCW 26.21A.140.

7. Within thirty days after issuance of an order determining which is the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it in each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency obtaining the order that fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.

8. An order that has been determined to be the controlling order, or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made pursuant to this section must be recognized in proceedings under this chapter.

\[ [2015 c 214 § 38](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5498-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20214%20§%2038); [2002 c 198 § 610](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2347-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20198%20§%20610); \]

## 26.21A.550 - Modification of child support order of another state.
1. If RCW 26.21A.560 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal of this state may modify a child support order issued in another state which is registered in this state if, after notice and hearing the tribunal finds that:

   a. The following requirements are met:

      i. Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides in the issuing state;

      ii. A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and

      iii. The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or

   b. This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

2. Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.

3. A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support. If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under RCW 26.21A.130 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.

4. In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.

5. On the issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

6. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (5) of this section and RCW 26.21A.100(2), a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:

   a. One party resides in another state; and

   b. The other party resides outside the United States.

\[ [2015 c 214 § 39](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5498-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20214%20§%2039); [2002 c 198 § 611](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2347-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20198%20§%20611); \]

## 26.21A.555 - Recognition of order modified in another state.
If a child support order issued by a tribunal of this state is modified by a tribunal of another state that assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the uniform interstate family support act, a tribunal of this state:

1. May enforce its order that was modified only as to arrears and interest accruing before the modification;

2. May provide other appropriate relief for violations of its order which occurred before the effective date of the modification; and

3. Shall recognize the modifying order of the other state, upon registration, for the purpose of enforcement.

\[ [2002 c 198 § 612](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2347-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20198%20§%20612); \]

## 26.21A.560 - Jurisdiction to modify child support order of another state when individual parties reside in this state.
1. If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this state and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state's child support order in a proceeding to register that order.

2. A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of this chapter, this article, and the procedural and substantive law of this state to the proceeding for enforcement or modification. Articles 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of this chapter do not apply.

\[ [2002 c 198 § 613](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2347-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20198%20§%20613); \]

## 26.21A.565 - Notice to issuing tribunal of modification.
Within thirty days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal that had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows the earlier order has been registered. A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

\[ [2002 c 198 § 614](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2347-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20198%20§%20614); \]

## 26.21A.570 - Jurisdiction to modify child support order of foreign country.
1. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 26.21A.625, if a foreign country lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its child support order pursuant to its laws, a tribunal of this state may assume jurisdiction to modify the child support order and bind all individuals subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal whether or not the consent to modification of a child support order otherwise required of the individual pursuant to RCW 26.21A.550 has been given or whether the individual seeking modification is a resident of this state or of the foreign country.

2. An order issued by a tribunal of this state modifying a foreign child support order pursuant to this section is the controlling order.

\[ [2015 c 214 § 40](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5498-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20214%20§%2040); [2002 c 198 § 615](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2347-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20198%20§%20615); \]

## 26.21A.575 - Procedure to register child support order of foreign country for modification.
A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a foreign child support order not under the convention may register that order in this state under RCW 26.21A.500 through 26.21A.535 if the order has not been registered. A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a request for registration, or at another time. The petition must specify the grounds for modification.

## 26.21A.617 - Recognition and enforcement of registered convention support order.

2. The following grounds are the only grounds on which a tribunal of this state may refuse recognition and enforcement of a registered convention support order:

4. In a contest of a foreign support agreement, a tribunal of this state may refuse recognition and enforcement of the agreement if it finds:

   a. Recognition and enforcement of the agreement is manifestly incompatible with public policy;

   b. The agreement was obtained by fraud or falsification;

   c. The agreement is incompatible with a support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose in this state, another state, or a foreign country if the support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this chapter in this state; or

5. A proceeding for recognition and enforcement of a foreign support agreement must be suspended during the pendency of a challenge to or appeal of the agreement before a tribunal of another state or a foreign country.

   b. On the demand by the governor of another state, surrender an individual found in this state who is charged criminally in the other state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee.

3. A provision for extradition of individuals not inconsistent with this chapter applies to the demand even if the individual whose surrender is demanded was not in the demanding state when the crime was allegedly committed and has not fled from the demanding state.

\[ [2002 c 198 § 801](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2347-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20198%20§%20801); \]

## 26.21A.655 - Conditions of rendition.
1. Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least sixty days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.

2. If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.

3. If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.
