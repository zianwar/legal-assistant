## 59.08.010 - Summons and complaint as notice—Acceptance of rent after default.
In cases of default in the payment of rent for real property where the stipulated rent or rental value does not exceed forty dollars per month, no notice to quit or pay rent, other than filing and serving a summons and complaint, as hereinafter provided, shall be required to render the holding of such tenant thereafter unlawful. If the landlord shall, after such default in the payment of rent, accept payment thereof, such acceptance of payment shall operate to reinstate the right of the tenant to possession for the full period fixed by the terms of any agreement relating to the right of possession.
