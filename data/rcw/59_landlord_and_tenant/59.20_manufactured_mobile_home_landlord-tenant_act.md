## 59.20.070 - Prohibited acts by landlord.
A landlord shall not:

1. Deny any tenant the right to sell such tenant's mobile home, manufactured home, or park model within a park, or prohibit, in any manner, any tenant from posting on the tenant's manufactured/mobile home or park model, or on the rented mobile home lot, a commercially reasonable "for sale" sign or any similar sign designed to advertise the sale of the manufactured/mobile home or park model. In addition, a landlord shall not require the removal of the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model from the park because of the sale thereof. Requirements for the transfer of the rental agreement are in RCW 59.20.073. Nothing in this subsection prohibits a landlord from enforcing reasonable rules or restrictions regarding the placement of "for sale" signs on the tenant's manufactured/mobile home or park model, or on the rented mobile home lot, if (a) the main purpose of the rules or restrictions is to protect the safety of park tenants or residents and (b) the rules or restrictions comply with RCW 59.20.045. The landlord may restrict the number of "for sale" signs on the lot to two and may restrict the size of the signs to conform to those in common use by home sale businesses;

2. Restrict the tenant's freedom of choice in purchasing goods or services but may reserve the right to approve or disapprove any exterior structural improvements on a mobile home space: PROVIDED, That door-to-door solicitation in the mobile home park may be restricted in the rental agreement. Door-to-door solicitation does not include public officials, housing and low-income assistance organizations, or candidates for public office meeting or distributing information to tenants in accordance with subsection (3) or (4) of this section;

3. Prohibit the distribution of information or meetings by tenants of the mobile home park to discuss mobile home living and affairs, including political caucuses or forums for or speeches of public officials or candidates for public office, meetings with housing and low-income assistance organizations, or meetings of organizations that represent the interest of tenants in the park, held in a tenant's home or any of the park community or recreation halls if these halls are open for the use of the tenants, conducted at reasonable times and in an orderly manner on the premises, nor penalize any tenant for participation in such activities;

4. Prohibit a public official, housing and low-income assistance organization, or candidate for public office from meeting with or distributing information to tenants in their individual mobile homes, manufactured homes, or park models, nor penalize any tenant for participating in these meetings or receiving this information;

5. Evict a tenant, terminate a rental agreement, decline to renew a rental agreement, increase rental or other tenant obligations, decrease services, or modify park rules in retaliation for any of the following actions on the part of a tenant taken in good faith:

   a. Filing a complaint with any federal, state, county, or municipal governmental authority relating to any alleged violation by the landlord of an applicable statute, regulation, or ordinance;

   b. Requesting the landlord to comply with the provision of this chapter or other applicable statute, regulation, or ordinance of the state, county, or municipality;

   c. Filing suit against the landlord for any reason;

   d. Participation or membership in any homeowners association or group;

6. Charge to any tenant a utility fee in excess of actual utility costs or intentionally cause termination or interruption of any tenant's utility services, including water, heat, electricity, or gas, except when an interruption of a reasonable duration is required to make necessary repairs;

7. Remove or exclude a tenant from the premises unless this chapter is complied with or the exclusion or removal is under an appropriate court order; or

8. Prevent the entry or require the removal of a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model for the sole reason that the mobile home has reached a certain age. Nothing in this subsection shall limit a landlord's right to exclude or expel a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model for any other reason, including but not limited to, failure to comply with fire, safety, and other provisions of local ordinances and state laws relating to mobile homes, manufactured homes, and park models, as long as the action conforms to this chapter or any other relevant statutory provision.

## 59.20.073 - Transfer of rental agreements.
1. Any rental agreement shall be assignable by the tenant to any person to whom he or she sells or transfers title to the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model.

2. A tenant who sells a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model within a park shall notify the landlord in writing of the date of the intended sale and transfer of the rental agreement at least fifteen days in advance of such intended transfer and shall notify the buyer in writing of the provisions of this section. The tenant shall verify in writing to the landlord payment of all taxes, rent, and reasonable expenses due on the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model and mobile home lot. The tenant shall notify the buyer of all taxes, rent, and reasonable expenses due on the manufactured/mobile home or park model and the mobile home lot.

3. At least seven days in advance of such intended transfer, the landlord shall:

   a. Notify the selling tenant, in writing, of a refusal to permit transfer of the rental agreement; or

   b. If the landlord approves of the transfer, provide the buyer with copies of the written rental agreement, the rules and regulations, and all other documents related to the tenancy. A landlord may not accept payment for rent or deposit from the buyer until the landlord has provided the buyer with these copies.

4. The landlord may require the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model to meet applicable fire and safety standards if a state or local agency responsible for the enforcement of fire and safety standards has issued a notice of violation of those standards to the tenant and those violations remain uncorrected. Upon correction of the violation to the satisfaction of the state or local agency responsible for the enforcement of that notice of violation, the landlord's refusal to permit the transfer is deemed withdrawn.

5. The landlord shall approve or disapprove of the assignment of a rental agreement on the same basis that the landlord approves or disapproves of any new tenant, and any disapproval shall be in writing. Consent to an assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld.

6. Failure to notify the landlord in writing, as required under subsection (2) of this section; or failure of the new tenant to make a good faith attempt to arrange an interview with the landlord to discuss assignment of the rental agreement; or failure of the current or new tenant to obtain written approval of the landlord for assignment of the rental agreement, shall be grounds for disapproval of such transfer.

## 59.20.074 - Rent—Liability of secured party with right to possession.
1. A secured party who has a security interest in a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model that is located within a mobile home park and who has a right to possession of the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model under *RCW 62A.9-503, shall be liable to the landlord from the date the secured party receives written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, for rent for occupancy of the mobile home space under the same terms the tenant was paying prior to repossession, and any other reasonable expenses incurred after the receipt of the notice, until disposition of the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model under *RCW 62A.9-504. The notice of default by a tenant must state the amount of rent and the amount and nature of any reasonable expenses that the secured party is liable for payment to the landlord. The notice must also state that the secured party will be provided a copy of the rental agreement previously signed by the tenant and the landlord upon request.

2. This section shall not affect the availability of a landlord's lien as provided in chapter 60.72 RCW.

3. As used in this section, "security interest" shall have the same meaning as this term is defined in RCW 62A.1-201, and "secured party" shall have the same meaning as this term is defined in *RCW 62A.9-105.

4. For purposes of this section, "reasonable expenses" means any routine maintenance and utility charges for which the tenant is liable under the rental agreement.

5. Any rent or other reasonable expenses owed by the secured party to the landlord pursuant to this section shall be paid to the landlord prior to the removal of the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model from the mobile home park.

6. If a secured party who has a secured interest in a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model that is located in a mobile home park becomes liable to the landlord pursuant to this section, then the relationship between the secured party and the landlord shall be governed by the rental agreement previously signed by the tenant and the landlord unless otherwise agreed, except that the term of the rental agreement shall convert to a month-to-month tenancy. No waiver is required to convert the rental agreement to a month-to-month tenancy. Either the landlord or the secured party may terminate the month-to-month tenancy upon giving written notice of thirty days or more. The secured party and the landlord are not required to execute a new rental agreement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to be a waiver of any rights by the tenant.

## 59.20.075 - Presumption of reprisal or retaliatory action.
Initiation by the landlord of any action listed in RCW 59.20.070(5) within one hundred twenty days after a good faith and lawful act by the tenant or within one hundred twenty days after any inspection or proceeding of a governmental agency resulting from such act, shall create a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof, that the action is a reprisal or retaliatory action against the tenant: PROVIDED, That if the court finds that the tenant made a complaint or report to a governmental authority within one hundred twenty days after notice of a proposed increase in rent or other action in good faith by the landlord, there is a rebuttable presumption that the complaint or report was not made in good faith: PROVIDED FURTHER, That no presumption against the landlord shall arise under this section, with respect to an increase in rent, if the landlord, in a notice to the tenant of increase in rent, specifies reasonable grounds for said increase, which grounds may include a substantial increase in market value due to remedial action under this chapter.

\[ [1999 c 359 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1378.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%20359%20§%209); [1984 c 58 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c58.pdf?cite=1984%20c%2058%20§%203); [1980 c 152 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1980c152.pdf?cite=1980%20c%20152%20§%206); \]

## 59.20.080 - Grounds for termination of tenancy or occupancy or failure to renew a tenancy or occupancy—Notice—Mediation.
1. A landlord shall not terminate or fail to renew a tenancy of a tenant or the occupancy of an occupant, of whatever duration except for one or more of the following reasons:

   a. In accordance with RCW 59.20.045(6), substantial violation, or repeated or periodic violations, of an enforceable rule of the mobile home park as established by the landlord at the inception of or during the tenancy or for violation of the tenant's duties as provided in RCW 59.20.140. The tenant shall be given written notice to cease the rule violation immediately. The notice shall state that failure to cease the violation of the rule or any subsequent violation of that or any other rule shall result in termination of the tenancy, and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within twenty days: PROVIDED, That for a periodic violation the notice shall also specify that repetition of the same violation shall result in termination: PROVIDED FURTHER, That in the case of a violation of a "material change" in park rules with respect to pets, tenants with minor children living with them, or recreational facilities, the tenant shall be given written notice under this chapter of a six month period in which to comply or vacate;

   b. Nonpayment of rent or other charges specified in the rental agreement, upon fourteen days written notice to pay rent and/or other charges or to vacate;

   c. Conviction of the tenant of a crime, commission of which threatens the health, safety, or welfare of the other mobile home park tenants. The tenant shall be given written notice of a fifteen day period in which to vacate;

   d. Failure of the tenant to comply with local ordinances and state laws and regulations relating to mobile homes, manufactured homes, or park models or mobile home, manufactured homes, or park model living within a reasonable time after the tenant's receipt of notice of such noncompliance from the appropriate governmental agency;

   e. Change of land use of the mobile home park including, but not limited to, closure of the mobile home park or conversion to a use other than for mobile homes, manufactured homes, or park models or conversion of the mobile home park to a mobile home park cooperative or mobile home park subdivision. The landlord shall give the tenants twelve months' notice in advance of the effective date of such change. The closure notice requirement does not apply if:

      i. The mobile home park or manufactured housing community has been acquired for or is under imminent threat of condemnation;

      ii. The mobile home park or manufactured housing community is sold to an organization comprised of park or community tenants, to a nonprofit organization, to a local government, or to a housing authority for the purpose of preserving the park or community; or

      iii. The landlord compensates the tenants for the loss of their homes at their assessed value, as determined by the county assessor as of the date the closure notice is issued, at any point during the closure notice period and prior to a change of use or sale of the property. At such time as the compensation is paid, the tenant shall be given written notice of at least ninety days in which to vacate, and the tenant shall continue to pay rent for as much time as he or she remains in the mobile home park or manufactured housing community;

   f. Engaging in "criminal activity." "Criminal activity" means a criminal act defined by statute or ordinance that threatens the health, safety, or welfare of the tenants. A park owner seeking to evict a tenant or occupant under this subsection need not produce evidence of a criminal conviction, even if the alleged misconduct constitutes a criminal offense. Notice from a law enforcement agency of criminal activity constitutes sufficient grounds, but not the only grounds, for an eviction under this subsection. Notification of the seizure of illegal drugs under RCW 59.20.155 is evidence of criminal activity and is grounds for an eviction under this subsection. The requirement that any tenant or occupant register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.130 is grounds for eviction of the sex offender under this subsection. If criminal activity is alleged to be a basis of termination, the park owner may proceed directly to an unlawful detainer action;

   g. The tenant's application for tenancy contained a material misstatement that induced the park owner to approve the tenant as a resident of the park, and the park owner discovers and acts upon the misstatement within one year of the time the resident began paying rent;

   h. If the landlord serves a tenant three twenty-day notices, each of which was valid under (a) of this subsection at the time of service, within a twelve-month period to comply or vacate for failure to comply with the material terms of the rental agreement or an enforceable park rule, other than failure to pay rent by the due date. The applicable twelve-month period shall commence on the date of the first violation;

   i. Failure of the tenant to comply with obligations imposed upon tenants by applicable provisions of municipal, county, and state codes, statutes, ordinances, and regulations, including this chapter. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to comply immediately. The notice must state that failure to comply will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within fifteen days;

   j. The tenant engages in disorderly or substantially annoying conduct upon the park premises that results in the destruction of the rights of others to the peaceful enjoyment and use of the premises. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to comply immediately. The notice must state that failure to comply will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within fifteen days;

   k. The tenant creates a nuisance that materially affects the health, safety, and welfare of other park residents. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to cease the conduct that constitutes a nuisance immediately. The notice must describe the nuisance and state (i) what the tenant must do to cease the nuisance and (ii) that failure to cease the conduct will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises in five days;

   l. Any other substantial just cause that materially affects the health, safety, and welfare of other park residents. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to comply immediately. The notice must describe the harm caused by the tenant, describe what the tenant must do to comply and to discontinue the harm, and state that failure to comply will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within fifteen days; or

   m. Failure to pay rent by the due date provided for in the rental agreement three or more times in a twelve-month period, commencing with the date of the first violation, after service of a fourteen-day notice to comply or vacate.

2. Within five days of a notice of eviction as required by subsection (1)(a) of this section, the landlord and tenant shall submit any dispute to mediation. The parties may agree in writing to mediation by an independent third party or through industry mediation procedures. If the parties cannot agree, then mediation shall be through industry mediation procedures. A duty is imposed upon both parties to participate in the mediation process in good faith for a period of ten days for an eviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section. It is a defense to an eviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section that a landlord did not participate in the mediation process in good faith.

3. Except for a tenant evicted under subsection (1)(c) or (f) of this section, a tenant evicted from a mobile home park under this section shall be allowed one hundred twenty days within which to sell the tenant's mobile home, manufactured home, or park model in place within the mobile home park: PROVIDED, That the tenant remains current in the payment of rent incurred after eviction, and pays any past due rent, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs at the time the rental agreement is assigned.

The rental agreement term for such recreational vehicles must be for no longer than the date on which the mobile home park is officially closed. Any short-term rental agreement provided under this section is not subject to the provisions of this chapter. For purposes of this section, a "recreational vehicle" does not mean a park model.

## 59.20.130 - Duties of landlord.
It shall be the duty of the landlord to:

1. Comply with codes, statutes, ordinances, and administrative rules applicable to the mobile home park;

2. Maintain the common premises and prevent the accumulation of stagnant water and to prevent the detrimental effects of moving water when such condition is not the fault of the tenant;

3. Keep any shared or common premises reasonably clean, sanitary, and safe from defects to reduce the hazards of fire or accident;

4. Keep all common premises of the mobile home park, and vacant mobile home lots, not in the possession of tenants, free of weeds or plant growth noxious and detrimental to the health of the tenants and free from potentially injurious or unsightly objects and condition;

5. Exterminate or make a reasonable effort to exterminate rodents, vermin, or other pests dangerous to the health and safety of the tenant whenever infestation exists on the common premises or whenever infestation occurs in the interior of a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model as a result of infestation existing on the common premises;

6. Maintain and protect all utilities provided to the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model in good working condition. Maintenance responsibility shall be determined at that point where the normal mobile home, manufactured home, or park model utilities "hook-ups" connect to those provided by the landlord or utility company;

7. Respect the privacy of the tenants and shall have no right of entry to a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model without the prior written consent of the occupant, except in case of emergency or when the occupant has abandoned the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model. Such consent may be revoked in writing by the occupant at any time. The ownership or management shall have a right of entry upon the land upon which a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model is situated for maintenance of utilities, to insure [ensure] compliance with applicable codes, statutes, ordinances, administrative rules, and the rental agreement and the rules of the park, and protection of the mobile home park at any reasonable time or in an emergency, but not in a manner or at a time which would interfere with the occupant's quiet enjoyment. The ownership or management shall make a reasonable effort to notify the tenant of their intention of entry upon the land which a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model is located prior to entry;

8. Allow tenants freedom of choice in the purchase of goods and services, and not unreasonably restrict access to the mobile home park for such purposes;

9. Maintain roads within the mobile home park in good condition; and

10. Notify each tenant within five days after a petition has been filed by the landlord for a change in the zoning of the land where the mobile home park is located and make a description of the change available to the tenant.

A landlord shall not have a duty to repair a defective condition under this section, nor shall any defense or remedy be available to the tenant under this chapter, if the defective condition complained of was caused by the conduct of the tenant, the tenant's family, invitee, or other person acting under the tenant's control, or if a tenant unreasonably fails to allow the landlord access to the property for purposes of repair.

## 59.20.134 - Written receipts for payments made by tenant.
1. A landlord must accept a personal check, cashier's check, or money order for any payment of rent made by a tenant, except that a landlord is not required to accept a personal check from any tenant that has had a personal check written to the landlord or the landlord's agent that has been returned for nonsufficient funds or account closure within the previous nine months.

## 59.20.135 - Maintenance of permanent structures—Findings and declarations—Definition.
1. The legislature finds that some mobile home park owners transfer the responsibility for the upkeep of permanent structures within the mobile home park to the park tenants. This transfer sometimes occurs after the permanent structures have been allowed to deteriorate. Many mobile home parks consist entirely of senior citizens who do not have the financial resources or physical capability to make the necessary repairs to these structures once they have fallen into disrepair. The inability of the tenants to maintain permanent structures can lead to significant safety hazards to the tenants as well as to visitors to the mobile home park. The legislature therefore finds and declares that it is in the public interest and necessary for the public health and safety to prohibit mobile home park owners from transferring the duty to maintain permanent structures in mobile home parks to the tenants.

2. A mobile home park owner is prohibited from transferring responsibility for the maintenance or care of permanent structures within the mobile home park to the tenants of the park. A provision within a rental agreement or other document transferring responsibility for the maintenance or care of permanent structures within the mobile home park to the park tenants is void.

3. A "permanent structure" for purposes of this section includes the clubhouse, carports, storage sheds, or other permanent structure. A permanent structure does not include structures built or affixed by a tenant. A permanent structure includes only those structures that were provided as amenities to the park tenants.

4. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a park owner from requiring a tenant to maintain his or her mobile home, manufactured home, or park model or yard. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a park owner from transferring responsibility for the maintenance or care of permanent structures within the mobile home park to an organization of park tenants or to an individual park tenant when requested by the tenant organization or individual tenant.

## 59.20.140 - Duties of tenant.
It shall be the duty of the tenant to pay the rental amount at such times and in such amounts as provided for in the rental agreement or as otherwise provided by law and comply with all obligations imposed upon tenants by applicable provisions of all municipal, county, and state codes, statutes, ordinances, and regulations, and in addition the tenant shall:

1. Keep the mobile home lot which he or she occupies and uses as clean and sanitary as the conditions of the premises permit;

2. Properly dispose of all rubbish, garbage, and other organic or flammable waste, in a clean and sanitary manner at reasonable and regular intervals, and assume all costs of extermination and fumigation for infestation caused by the tenant on the tenant's leased premises;

3. Not intentionally or negligently destroy, deface, damage, impair, or remove any facilities, equipment, furniture, furnishings, fixtures, or appliances provided by the landlord, or permit any member of his or her family, invitee, or licensee, or any person acting under his or her control to do so;

4. Not permit a nuisance or common waste; and

5. Not engage in drug-related activities as defined in RCW 59.20.080.

## 59.20.145 - Live-in care provider—Not a tenant—Agreements—Guest fee.
A tenant in a mobile home park may share his or her mobile home, manufactured home, or park model with any person over eighteen years of age, if that person is providing live-in home health care or live-in hospice care to the tenant under an approved plan of treatment ordered by the tenant's physician. The live-in care provider is not considered a tenant of the park and shall have no rights of tenancy in the park. Any agreement between the tenant and the live-in care provider does not change the terms and conditions of the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant. The live-in care provider shall comply with the rules of the mobile home park, the rental agreement, and this chapter. The landlord may not charge a guest fee for the live-in care provider.

1. Any notice required by this chapter to be given to a tenant shall be served on behalf of the landlord: (a) By delivering a copy personally to the tenant; or (b) if the tenant is absent from the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model by affixing a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model and also sending a copy through the mail addressed to the tenant at the tenant's last known address.

2. Any notice required by this chapter to be given to the landlord shall be served by the tenant in the same manner as provided for in subsection (1) of this section, or by mail to the landlord at such place as shall be expressly provided in the rental agreement.

3. The landlord shall state in any notice of eviction required by RCW 59.20.080(1) as now or hereafter amended the specific reason for eviction in a clear and concise manner.

## 59.20.160 - Moneys paid as deposit or security for performance by tenant—Written rental agreement to specify terms and conditions for retention by landlord.
If any moneys are paid to the landlord by the tenant as a deposit or as security for performance of the tenant's obligations in a written rental agreement, such rental agreement shall include the terms and conditions under which the deposit or portion thereof may be withheld by the landlord upon termination of the rental agreement. If all or part of the deposit may be withheld to indemnify the landlord for damages to the mobile home space for which the tenant is responsible, the rental agreement shall so specify. It is unlawful to charge or collect a deposit or security for performance if the parties have not entered into a written rental agreement.

Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, unless otherwise agreed in writing, the landlord shall be entitled to receipt of interest paid on such trust account deposits. The landlord shall provide the tenant with a written receipt for the deposit and shall provide written notice of the name and address and location of the depository and any subsequent change thereof. If during a tenancy the status of landlord is transferred to another, any sums in the deposit trust account affected by such transfer shall simultaneously be transferred to an equivalent trust account of the successor landlord, and the successor landlord shall promptly notify the tenant of the transfer and of the name, address and location of the new depository. The tenant's claim to any moneys paid under this section shall be prior to that of any creditor of the landlord, including a trustee in bankruptcy or receiver, even if such moneys are commingled.

2. All moneys paid, in excess of two months' rent on the mobile home lot, to the landlord by the tenant as a deposit as security for performance of the tenant's obligations in a rental agreement shall be deposited into an interest-bearing trust account for the particular tenant. The interest accruing on the deposit in the account, minus fees charged to administer the account, shall be paid to the tenant on an annual basis.

## 59.20.180 - Moneys paid as deposit or security for performance by tenant—Statement and notice of basis for retention.
Within fourteen days after the termination of the rental agreement and vacation of the mobile home space, the landlord shall give a full and specific statement of the basis for retaining any of the deposit together with the payment of any refund due the tenant under the terms and conditions of the rental agreement. No portion of any deposit shall be withheld on account of wear resulting from ordinary use of the mobile home space.

The statement shall be delivered to the tenant personally or by mail to the last known address. If the landlord fails to give such statement together with any refund due the tenant within the time limits specified above such landlord shall be liable to the tenant for the full amount of the refund due.

3. Subject to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, not more than seven days in the case of a repair under RCW 59.20.130(3);

4. Not more than thirty days in all other cases.

In each instance the burden shall be on the landlord to see that remedial work under this section is completed with reasonable promptness.

1. [Empty]

   a. If at any time during the tenancy, the landlord fails to carry out any of the duties imposed by RCW 59.20.130, and notice of the defect is given to the landlord pursuant to RCW 59.20.200, the tenant may submit to the landlord or the landlord's designated agent by certified mail or in person at least two bids to perform the repairs necessary to correct the defective condition from licensed or registered persons, or if no licensing or registration requirement applies to the type of work to be performed, from responsible persons capable of performing such repairs. Such bids may be submitted to the landlord at the same time as notice is given pursuant to RCW 59.20.200.

   b. Upon receipt of any such bids, the landlord shall provide the tenant with a copy of the notice regarding the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program that the attorney general is required to produce pursuant to RCW 59.30.030(3)(a) and that landlords are required to post pursuant to RCW 59.30.030(3)(b)(i).

2. If the landlord fails to commence repair of the defective condition within a reasonable time after receipt of notice from the tenant, the tenant may contract with the person submitting the lowest bid to make the repair, and upon the completion of the repair and an opportunity for inspection by the landlord or the landlord's designated agent, the tenant may deduct the cost of repair from the rent in an amount not to exceed the sum expressed in dollars representing one month's rental of the tenant's mobile home space in any calendar year. When, however, the landlord is required to begin remedying the defective condition within thirty days under RCW 59.20.200, the tenant cannot contract for repairs for at least fifteen days following receipt of bids by the landlord. The total costs of repairs deducted by the tenant in any calendar year under this subsection shall not exceed the sum expressed in dollars representing one month's rental of the tenant's mobile home space.

3. Two or more tenants shall not collectively initiate remedies under this section. Remedial action under this section shall not be initiated for conditions in the design or construction existing in a mobile home park before June 7, 1984.

4. The provisions of this section shall not:

   a. Create a relationship of employer and employee between landlord and tenant; or

   b. Create liability under the worker's compensation act; or

   c. Constitute the tenant as an agent of the landlord for the purposes of mechanics' and material suppliers' liens under chapter 60.04 RCW.

5. Any repair work performed under this section shall comply with the requirements imposed by any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or rule. A landlord whose property is damaged because of repairs performed in a negligent manner may recover the actual damages in an action against the tenant.

6. Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement to be between the parties, and this agreement does not alter the landlord's obligations under this chapter.

Such decisions may be enforced as other judgments at law and shall be available to the tenant as a set-off against any existing or subsequent claims of the landlord.

The court or arbitrator may also authorize the tenant to contract to make further corrective repairs. The court or arbitrator shall specify a time period in which the landlord may make such repairs before the tenant may contract for such repairs.
