## 24.03A.195 - Binding agreement to modify or release restrictions.
1. If a gift instrument limits the use of the gift to one or more charitable purposes, and the conditions set forth in subsection (3) or (4) of this section are satisfied, then the gift instrument may be modified by agreement of the nonprofit corporation, the attorney general, and all other interested parties.

2. For purposes of this section, an "interested party" does not include:

   a. The donor; or

   b. Any member of any charitable class that the gift would benefit, either before or after the modifications to be made by the agreement.

3. A restriction related to a gift's management or investment may be modified by an agreement described in subsection (1) of this section if:

   a. Because of circumstances not anticipated by the donor, modification will further the charitable purpose of the gift;

   b. Enforcement of the restriction has become impracticable or wasteful; or

   c. Enforcement of the restriction impairs the management or investment of the gift.

4. A restriction on the use of a gift relating to the gift's charitable purpose, rather than its management or investment, may be modified by an agreement described in subsection (1) of this section if the purpose becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful.

   a. Be in writing and executed by all of the parties;

   b. Be binding and conclusive on the nonprofit corporation and all other parties with a beneficial interest in the gift;

The court shall determine whether the agreement adequately represents and protects the interests of the parties and the public interest, and enter an order declaring its determination. If the court determines that the agreement does not adequately represent and protect those interests, then the agreement is void.

The court may not, however, modify any restriction under the procedure set out in subsection (2) of this section to defeat the interest of an alternate beneficiary unless the beneficiary would also be subject to, and unable to perform, the term requiring modification. The alternative beneficiary is entitled to notice and may participate in the determination of whether to grant modification.

4. Any modification made by the court must, to the extent possible, be made in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes as expressed in the gift instrument.

5. A nonprofit corporation shall notify the attorney general whenever it seeks to modify a charitable gift restriction under this section and the court shall offer the attorney general an opportunity to be heard.

The list of members must be available for inspection by any member, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the membership corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A member or the member's agent, on demand in the form of a record, may inspect and, subject to the requirements of RCW 24.03A.215(4), copy the list, during regular business hours and at the member's expense, during the period it is available for inspection.

Within ten business days after receiving a demand under this subsection, the corporation shall deliver to the member making the demand an offer of a reasonable alternative method of achieving the purpose identified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the list of members. An alternative method that reasonably and in a timely manner accomplishes the proper purpose set forth in the demand relieves the corporation from making the list of members available under subsection (4)(b) of this section, unless within a reasonable time after acceptance of the offer the corporation fails to do the things it offered to do. Any rejection of the corporation's offer must be in the form of a record and indicate the reasons the alternative proposed by the corporation does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.

5. Unless the articles or bylaws require otherwise, if an annual, regular, or special meeting of the members is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if the new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or is required to be fixed under RCW 24.03A.420, then the corporation shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to the members entitled to vote on the new record date.

   a. A member or the member's agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member by executing an appointment form in the form of a record. An appointment form must contain or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the member or the member's agent or attorney-in-fact authorized the appointment of the proxy.

   b. An appointment of a proxy is effective when an executed appointment in the form of a record is received by the inspectors of election, the officer or agent of the membership corporation authorized to tabulate votes, or the secretary. An appointment is valid for eleven months unless a shorter or longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form.

   c. The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the membership corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the inspectors of election, the officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, or the secretary before the proxy exercises his or her authority under the appointment.

   d. A membership corporation may accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the member making the appointment, subject to RCW 24.03A.455 and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority stated in the appointment form.

   e. A proxy may be revoked by a member by delivering notice in the form of a record to the corporation before the corporation has relied upon the proxy.

## 24.03A.435 - Voting entitlement of members.
Except as provided in the articles or bylaws, each member is entitled to one vote on each matter on which the articles or bylaws entitle the members of the class of members to which the member belongs to vote.

\[ [2021 c 176 Â§ 2310](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5034-S.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20176%20Â§%202310); \]

## 24.03A.440 - Membership quorum and voting requirements.
1. Members may take action at a meeting on matters with respect to which all of the members are entitled to vote only if a quorum of the members is present.

2. Members entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those members is present with respect to that matter. Except as provided in the articles or bylaws, ten percent of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.

3. Once a member is represented for any purpose at a meeting, the member is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or is required to be set for that adjourned meeting.

4. If a quorum is present, then action on a matter other than the election of directors by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles, bylaws, or applicable law require a greater number of affirmative votes.

5. An amendment of the articles or bylaws adding, changing, or deleting a quorum or voting requirement for a voting group greater than specified in subsection (2) or (4) of this section is governed by RCW 24.03A.445.

6. If a meeting cannot be organized because a quorum of members entitled to vote is not present, then those members present may adjourn the meeting to such a time and place as they may determine. When a meeting that has been adjourned for lack of a quorum is reconvened, those members present, although less than a quorum as fixed in this section, the articles, or the bylaws, nonetheless constitute a quorum, if notice of the time and place of the reconvened meeting is provided by electronic transmission or in person to the members entitled to vote at least twenty-four hours before the reconvened meeting, or by other methods pursuant to the requirements and procedures set forth in RCW 24.03A.410. The articles or the bylaws may, however, permit the reconvening of a meeting without notice, by means of a provision that makes explicit reference to elimination of the notice requirement that would otherwise apply under this section.

7. The election of directors is governed by RCW 24.03A.450.

2. Except as provided in the articles or bylaws, or under subsection (3) of this section, members do not have a right to cumulate their votes for directors.

If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of its member, then the membership corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member if:

   a. The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity;

   b.

   c. The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the member and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment;

   e. Two or more persons are the member as cotenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the co-owners.

3. The membership corporation may reject a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's authority to sign for the member.

4. The membership corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section or RCW 24.03A.430(2) are not liable in damages to the member for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.

5. Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless the court determines otherwise.

The consent may specify the time at which the action taken in the consent is to be effective.

   a. The material facts as to the relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board and the board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors even though the disinterested directors are less than a quorum;

2. In any proceeding seeking equitable relief or other remedies, based upon an alleged improper taking advantage of a business opportunity by a director or officer, the fact that the director or officer did not employ the procedure described in subsection (1) of this section before taking advantage of the opportunity does not support an inference that the opportunity should have been first presented to the nonprofit corporation or alter the burden of proof otherwise applicable to establish that the director or officer breached a duty to the corporation in the circumstances.

\[ [2021 c 176 Â§ 2704](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5034-S.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20176%20Â§%202704); \]

   a. Except as provided in (e) of this subsection, a proposed amendment must be adopted by the board.

   b. Except as provided in RCW 24.03A.670 and 24.03A.675, a proposed amendment must be submitted to the members entitled to vote on the amendment, if any, for their approval.

   c. The board shall deliver to all members a recommendation that the members approve an amendment, unless the board makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board shall deliver to the members the basis for that determination.

   d. The board may condition its submission of an amendment to the members on any basis. Such a condition is in addition to any approval requirements set forth in the corporation's articles or bylaws or in this chapter.

   e. If the articles or bylaws so permit, an amendment may be proposed by ten percent or more of the members entitled to vote on the amendment, or by a greater number of members if the articles or bylaws so specify. The provisions of (a), (c), and (d) of this subsection do not apply to an amendment proposed by the members under this subsection.

   f. If an amendment is required to be approved by the members, including under (e) of this subsection, and the approval is to be given at a meeting, then the corporation shall give notice to each member, whether or not entitled to vote on the amendment, of the meeting of members at which the amendment is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the amendment and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the amendment. If a summary is provided in lieu of a copy of the amendment, then a copy must be available to members upon request and the notice shall state that fact.

   g. At a meeting described in (f) of this subsection, those members entitled to vote on the amendment may:

      i. Approve or reject the amendment exactly as provided or summarized in the notice of the meeting; or

      ii. Approve revisions to the amendment at the meeting, if the subject matter of the revisions is within the scope of the subject matter of the amendment as provided or summarized in the notice of the meeting.

   h. The board shall determine whether the subject matter of any revisions approved by members remains within the scope of the subject matter of the amendment as provided or summarized in the notice of the meeting. If the board determines that the revisions approved by the members are not within that scope, then the amendment is deemed rejected by the membership. If the board determines that the revisions by members are within scope, then the board may:

   i. Accept the amendment incorporating the revisions approved by the members; or

      ii. Propose a further revised amendment to the members for approval.

This process may continue until an amendment acceptable to the board has been approved by the members. If successive votes take place at the same meeting of members, then no further notices or meetings are required.

      i. Unless the articles or bylaws, or the board acting pursuant to (d) of this subsection, requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of an amendment by the members entitled to vote thereon requires the approval of those members at a meeting at which a quorum is present, and, if any class of members is entitled to vote as a separate group on the amendment, the approval of each separate voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is present.

   j. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, an amendment adopted by the board under this subsection must also be approved, if the amendment changes or deletes a provision regarding the appointment of a director by persons other than the board, by those persons as if they constituted a voting group.

   k. If a membership corporation has no members entitled to vote on the amendment, then the corporation shall deliver notice of the approval of the amendment by the board to all members of the corporation at least five days before filing articles of amendment or restated articles of incorporation with the secretary of state.

2. Unless the articles provide otherwise, the board of a membership corporation may adopt amendments to the corporation's articles without approval of the members to:

   a. Delete the names and addresses of the initial directors;

   b. Notwithstanding RCW 24.03A.100(2), delete the name of each incorporator and the name and address of the initial registered agent or registered office, if a statement of change is on file with the secretary of state; or

   c. Restate without change all of the then operative provisions of the articles.

If restated articles of incorporation of a membership corporation include one or more new amendments that require member approval, then the amendments must have been adopted and approved as provided in RCW 24.03A.650 or 24.03A.655, as appropriate.

3. A nonprofit corporation that restates its articles of incorporation shall deliver to the secretary of state for filing articles of restatement setting forth the name of the nonprofit corporation and the text of the restated articles of incorporation together with a certificate setting forth:

## 24.03A.735 - Adoption of plan of merger.
In the case of a nonprofit corporation that is a party to a merger:

1. The plan of merger must be adopted by the board.

2. Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, RCW 24.03A.730, or the articles or bylaws, after adopting the plan of merger, the board shall submit the plan to those members entitled to vote on the plan for their approval. The board shall also deliver to the members a recommendation that the members approve the plan, unless the board makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board shall deliver to the members the basis for that determination.

3. The board may condition its submission of the plan of merger to the members on any basis.

4. If the plan of merger is required to be approved by the members, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, then the nonprofit corporation shall give notice to each member, whether or not entitled to vote on the merger, of the meeting of members at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing corporation or eligible entity, then the notice shall also include a copy or summary of the articles and bylaws or organic records of that corporation or eligible entity. If the corporation is to be merged into a corporation or eligible entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, then the notice shall include a copy or a summary of the articles and bylaws or organic records of the new corporation or eligible entity. If a summary is provided in lieu of a copy of the plan or of the articles and bylaws, then a copy of the plan and articles and bylaws, as applicable, must be available to members upon request and this fact must be stated in the notice. Such copy of the plan and articles and bylaws, as applicable, may be made available in electronic format.

5. Unless the articles or bylaws, or the board acting pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of the plan of merger by the members entitled to vote thereon requires the approval of a majority of those members at a meeting at which a quorum is present, and, if any class of members is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger, the approval of a majority of the members of each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is present.

6. Separate voting on a plan of merger is required:

   a. By each class of members:

      i. Whose memberships are to be converted into eligible interests, securities, or obligations; rights to acquire eligible interests, securities, or obligations; cash; other property or other consideration; or any combination of the foregoing;

      ii. Which is to experience a change in the rights, powers, preferences, or limitations of the class as a result of the merger; or

      iii. That would be entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to [the] articles of incorporation, would require action by separate voting groups under the articles or bylaws.

   b. By a voting group, if the voting group is entitled under the articles or bylaws to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of merger.

7. If a plan of merger would affect in the same or a substantially similar way two or more classes of members entitled to vote separately on the plan of merger under subsection (6)(a) of this section, then, instead of voting separately, all similarly affected classes of members shall vote together as a single voting group on the plan of merger, unless otherwise provided in the articles or as a condition imposed by the board under subsection (3) of this section.

8. If as a result of a merger one or more members of a domestic nonprofit corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations[,] or liabilities of any other person or entity, then approval of the plan of merger requires the execution, by each member who would become subject to owner liability, of a separate record consenting to become subject to owner liability.

9. If a domestic nonprofit corporation that is a party to a merger does not have any members entitled to vote on the merger, then a plan of merger is deemed adopted by the corporation when it has been adopted by the board pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. If a membership corporation has no members entitled to vote on the merger, then the corporation shall deliver notice of the proposed merger to all members of the corporation at least five days before the meeting at which the board is to adopt the plan of merger.

10. In addition to the adoption and approval of the plan of merger by the board and members as required by this section, the plan of merger must also be approved in the form of a record by any person or group of persons whose approval is required under RCW 24.03A.705 to amend the articles or bylaws.

11. Adoption and approval of a plan of merger by all required persons under the procedures set forth in this section constitutes adoption and approval of all changes to the approving party's articles, bylaws, or other organic documents contained within the plan of merger.

   d. If the plan of merger did not require approval by the members of a domestic nonprofit corporation that was a party to the merger, a statement to that effect;

3. Articles of merger must be delivered to the secretary of state for filing by the surviving entity of the merger and shall take effect at the effective time provided in RCW 23.95.210. Articles of merger filed under this section may be combined with any filing required under the organic law of any domestic eligible entity involved in the transaction if the combined filing satisfies the requirements of both this section and the other organic law.

2. A person who becomes subject to owner liability for some or all of the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any entity as a result of a merger has owner liability only to the extent provided in the organic law of the entity and only for those debts, obligations, and liabilities that arise after the effective time of the articles of merger, except to the extent that the person consented to become subject to liability under RCW 24.03A.735(8).

3. The effect of a merger on the owner liability of a person who had owner liability for some or all of the debts, obligations, or liabilities of a party to the merger is as follows:

5. If the approval of the members is to be given at a meeting, then the corporation shall notify each member, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of members at which the plan of entity conversion is to be submitted for approval.
