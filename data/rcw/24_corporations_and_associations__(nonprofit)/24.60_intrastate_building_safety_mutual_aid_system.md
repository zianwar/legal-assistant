   a. Counties;

   b. Cities and towns;

   c. Tribal governmental entities that declare an intention, in writing, to participate as a member jurisdiction in the intrastate building safety mutual aid system; and

   d. Other governmental entities with responsibilities of ensuring building safety.

In the case of cities and towns, it means the mayor in those cities and towns with mayor-council or commission forms of government, where the mayor is directly elected, and it means the city manager in those cities and towns with council manager forms of government.
