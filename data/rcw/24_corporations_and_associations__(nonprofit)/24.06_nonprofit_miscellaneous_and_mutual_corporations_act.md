The articles of incorporation may limit or deny the voting rights of or provide special voting rights for the shares of any class to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.

2. Without limiting the authority herein contained, a corporation, when so provided in its articles of incorporation, may issue shares of preferred or special classes:

   a. Subject to the right of the corporation to redeem any of such shares at the price fixed by the articles of incorporation for the redemption thereof.

   b. Entitling the holders thereof to cumulative, noncumulative, or partially cumulative dividends.

   c. Having preference over any other members or class or classes of shares as to the payment of dividends.

3. The consideration for the issuance of shares may be paid in whole or in part, in money, in other property, tangible or intangible, or in labor or services actually performed for the corporation. When payment of the consideration for which shares are to be issued shall have been received by the corporation, such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable.

Neither promissory notes nor future services shall constitute payment or part payment, for shares of a corporation.

In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the board of directors or the shareholders, as the case may be, as to the value of the consideration received for shares shall be conclusive.

4. A subscription for shares of a corporation to be organized shall be in writing and be irrevocable for a period of six months, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the subscription agreement or unless all of the subscribers consent to the revocation of such subscription.

Unless otherwise provided in the subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares, whether made before or after the organization of a corporation, shall be paid in full at such time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined by the board of directors. Any call made by the board of directors for payment on subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same class or as to all shares of the same series, as the case may be. In case of default in the payment of any installment or call when such payment is due, the corporation may proceed to collect the amount due in the same manner as any debt due the corporation. The bylaws may prescribe other penalties for failure to pay installments or calls that may become due, but no penalty working a forfeiture of a subscription, or of the amounts paid thereon, shall be declared as against any subscriber unless the amount due thereon shall remain unpaid for a period of twenty days after written demand has been made therefor. If mailed, such written demand shall be deemed to be made when deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to the subscriber at his or her last post office address known to the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. In the event of the sale of any shares by reason of any forfeiture, the excess of proceeds realized over the amount due and unpaid on such shares shall be paid to the delinquent subscriber or to his or her legal representative.

In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer at the date of its issue.

Every certificate representing shares issued by a corporation which is authorized to issue shares of more than one class shall set forth upon the face or back of the certificate, or shall state that the corporation will furnish to any shareholder upon request and without charge, a full statement of the designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights of the shares of each class authorized to be issued and, if the corporation is authorized to issue any preferred or special class in series, the variations in the relative rights and preferences between the shares of each such series so far as the same have been fixed and determined and the authority of the board of directors to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of subsequent series.

No member of a class may acquire any interest which will entitle him or her to a greater vote than any other member of the same class.

A member or shareholder may vote in person or, unless the articles of incorporation or the bylaws otherwise provide, may vote by mail, by electronic transmission, or by proxy executed in writing by the member or shareholder or by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact: PROVIDED, That no proxy shall be valid for more than eleven months from the date of its execution unless otherwise specified in the proxy.

If a member or shareholder may vote by proxy, the proxy may be given by:

Execution may be accomplished by the member or shareholder or the member's or shareholder's authorized officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile signature; or

2. Authorizing another person or persons to act for the member or shareholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy, or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission. If it is determined that the electronic transmissions are valid, the inspector of election or, if there are no inspectors, any other officer or agent of the corporation making that determination on behalf of the corporation shall specify the information upon which they relied. The corporation shall require the holders of proxies received by electronic transmission to provide to the corporation copies of the electronic transmission and the corporation shall retain copies of the electronic transmission for a reasonable period of time.

If specifically permitted by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, whenever proposals or directors or officers are to be voted upon, such vote may be taken by mail or by electronic transmission if the name of each candidate and the text of each proposal to be so voted upon are set forth in a writing accompanying or contained in the notice of meeting.

The articles of incorporation or the bylaws may provide that in all elections for directors every person entitled to vote shall have the right to cumulate his or her vote and to give one candidate a number of votes equal to his or her vote multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, or by distributing such votes on the same principle among any number of such candidates.

\[ [1969 ex.s. c 120 § 47](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969ex1c120.pdf?cite=1969%20ex.s.%20c%20120%20§%2047); \]

\[ [2000 c 167 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2320-S.SL.pdf?cite=2000%20c%20167%20§%2010); [1969 ex.s. c 120 § 48](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969ex1c120.pdf?cite=1969%20ex.s.%20c%20120%20§%2048); \]

## 24.06.245 - Right of member or shareholder to dissent.
Any member or shareholder of a corporation shall have the right to dissent from any of the following corporate actions:

1. Any plan of merger or consolidation to which the corporation is a party other than a merger or consolidation in which all members or shareholders of the corporation have the right to continue their membership or shareholder status in the surviving corporation on substantially similar terms; or

2. Any sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the corporation not made in the usual and regular course of its business, including a sale in dissolution, but not including a sale pursuant to an order of a court having jurisdiction in the premises or a sale for cash on terms requiring that all or substantially all of the net proceeds of sale be distributed to the shareholders in accordance with their respective interests within one year after the date of sale; or

3. Any amendment to the articles of incorporation that materially reduces the number of shares owned by a shareholder to a fraction of a share if the fractional share is to be acquired by the corporation for cash; or

4. Any corporate action taken pursuant to a member or shareholder vote to the extent that the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors provides that voting or nonvoting members or shareholders are entitled to dissent and obtain payment for their membership or shares.

A member or shareholder entitled to dissent and obtain payment for the member's or shareholder's membership interest or shares under this chapter may not challenge the corporate action creating the member's or shareholder's entitlement unless the action fails to comply with the procedural requirements imposed by this title, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws, or is fraudulent with respect to the member or shareholder or the corporation.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to the members or shareholders of the surviving corporation in a merger if such corporation is on the date of the filing of the articles of merger the owner of all the outstanding shares of the other corporations, domestic or foreign, which are parties to the merger.

The meeting notice for any meeting at which a proposed corporate action creating dissenters' rights is submitted to a vote must state that members or shareholders are or may be entitled to assert dissenters' rights and be accompanied by a copy of RCW 24.06.250.

\[ [2001 c 271 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1545-S.SL.pdf?cite=2001%20c%20271%20§%2013); [1969 ex.s. c 120 § 49](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969ex1c120.pdf?cite=1969%20ex.s.%20c%20120%20§%2049); \]

## 24.06.250 - Exercise of right of dissent—Rights and liabilities.
Any member or shareholder electing to exercise such right of dissent shall file with the corporation, prior to or at the meeting of members and shareholders at which such proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote, a written objection to such proposed corporate action. If such proposed corporate action be approved by the required vote and such member or shareholder shall not have voted in favor thereof, such member or shareholder may, within ten days after the date on which the vote was taken, make written demand on the corporation, or, in the case of a merger or consolidation, on the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, for payment of the fair value of such member's membership or of such shareholder's shares, and, if such proposed corporate action is effected, such corporation shall pay to such member, upon surrender of his or her membership certificate, if any, or to such shareholder, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares, the fair value thereof as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the proposed corporate action, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of such corporate action. Any member or shareholder failing to make demand within the ten day period shall be bound by the terms of the proposed corporate action. Any member or shareholder making such demand shall thereafter be entitled only to payment as in this section provided and shall not be entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a member or shareholder.

No such demand shall be withdrawn unless the corporation shall consent thereto. The right of such member or shareholder to be paid the fair value of his or her membership or shares shall cease and his or her status as a member or shareholder shall be restored, without prejudice to any corporate proceedings which may have been taken during the interim, if:

1. Such demand shall be withdrawn upon consent; or

2. The proposed corporate action shall be abandoned or rescinded or the members or shareholders shall revoke the authority to effect such action; or

3. In the case of a merger, on the date of the filing of the articles of merger the surviving corporation is the owner of all the outstanding shares of the other corporations, domestic and foreign, that are parties to the merger; or

4. A court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such member or shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by this section.

Within ten days after such corporate action is effected, the corporation, or, in the case of a merger or consolidation, the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, shall give written notice thereof to each dissenting member or shareholder who has made demand as herein provided, and shall make a written offer to each such member or shareholder to pay for such shares or membership at a specified price deemed by such corporation to be the fair value thereof. Except in cases where the fair value payable to dissenters is fixed in the articles of incorporation or pursuant to RCW 24.06.255, such notice and offer shall be accompanied by a balance sheet of the corporation in which the member holds his or her membership or the dissenting shareholder holds shares, as of the latest available date and not more than twelve months prior to the making of such offer, and a profit and loss statement of such corporation for the twelve months' period ended on the date of such balance sheet.

If the fair value payable to dissenting members or shareholders is fixed in the articles of incorporation or pursuant to RCW 24.06.255, or if within thirty days after the date on which such corporate action was effected the fair value of such shares or membership is agreed upon between any such dissenting member or shareholder and the corporation, payment therefor shall be made within ninety days after the date on which such corporate action was effected, upon surrender of the membership certificate, if any, or upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Upon payment of the agreed value the dissenting member or shareholder shall cease to have any interest in such membership or shares.

If the fair value payable to dissenting members or shareholders is not fixed in the articles of incorporation or pursuant to RCW 24.06.025, and within such period of thirty days a dissenting member or shareholder and the corporation do not so agree, then the dissenting member or shareholder shall be entitled to make written demand to the corporation, within sixty days after the date on which such corporate action was effected, requesting that the corporation petition for a determination of the fair value by a court. If such a demand is not timely made on the corporation, the right of such member or shareholder to demand to be paid the fair value of his or her membership or shares shall be forfeited. Within thirty days after receipt of such a written demand from any dissenting member or shareholder, the corporation shall, or at its election at any time within ninety days after the date on which such corporate action was effected may, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in this state where the registered office of the corporation is located praying that the fair value of such membership or shares be found and determined. If, in the case of a merger or consolidation, the surviving or new corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, such petition shall be filed in the county where the registered office of the domestic corporation was last located. If the corporation shall fail to institute the proceeding as herein provided, any dissenting member or shareholder may do so in the name of the corporation. All dissenting members and shareholders, wherever residing, shall be made parties to the proceeding as an action against their memberships or shares quasi in rem. A copy of the petition shall be served on each dissenting member and shareholder who is a resident of this state and shall be served by registered or certified mail on each dissenting member or shareholder who is a nonresident. Service on nonresidents shall also be made by publication as provided by law. The jurisdiction of the court shall be plenary and exclusive. All members and shareholders who are parties to the proceeding shall be entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount of the fair value of their shares. The court may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers shall have such power and authority as shall be specified in the order of their appointment or an amendment thereof. The judgment shall be payable only upon and concurrently with the surrender to the corporation of the membership certificate, if any, or of the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder or member shall cease to have any interest in such shares or membership.

The judgment shall include an allowance for interest at such rate as the court may find to be fair and equitable in all the circumstances, from the date on which the vote was taken on the proposed corporate action to the date of payment.

The costs and expenses of any such proceeding shall be determined by the court and shall be assessed against the corporation, but all or any part of such costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed as the court may deem equitable against any or all of the dissenting members and shareholders who are parties to the proceeding to whom the corporation shall have made an offer to pay for membership or shares if the court shall find that the action of such members or shareholders in failing to accept such offer was arbitrary or vexatious or not in good faith. Such expenses shall include reasonable compensation for and reasonable expenses of the appraisers, but shall exclude the fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party; but if the fair value of the memberships or shares as determined materially exceeds the amount which the corporation offered to pay therefor, or if no offer was made, the court in its discretion may award to any member or shareholder who is a party to the proceeding such sum as the court may determine to be reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed by the member or shareholder in the proceeding.

Within twenty days after demanding payment for his or her shares or membership, each member and shareholder demanding payment shall submit the certificate or certificates representing his or her membership or shares to the corporation for notation thereon that such demand has been made.
