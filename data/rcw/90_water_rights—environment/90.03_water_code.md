## 90.03.005 - State water policy—Cooperation with other agencies—Reduction of wasteful practices.
It is the policy of the state to promote the use of the public waters in a fashion which provides for obtaining maximum net benefits arising from both diversionary uses of the state's public waters and the retention of waters within streams and lakes in sufficient quantity and quality to protect instream and natural values and rights. Consistent with this policy, the state supports economically feasible and environmentally sound development of physical facilities through the concerted efforts of the state with the United States, public corporations, Indian tribes, or other public or private entities. Further, based on the tenet of water law which precludes wasteful practices in the exercise of rights to the use of waters, the department of ecology shall reduce these practices to the maximum extent practicable, taking into account sound principles of water management, the benefits and costs of improved water use efficiency, and the most effective use of public and private funds, and, when appropriate, to work to that end in concert with the agencies of the United States and other public and private entities.

## 90.03.010 - Appropriation of water rights—Existing rights preserved.
The power of the state to regulate and control the waters within the state shall be exercised as hereinafter in this chapter provided. Subject to existing rights all waters within the state belong to the public, and any right thereto, or to the use thereof, shall be hereafter acquired only by appropriation for a beneficial use and in the manner provided and not otherwise; and, as between appropriations, the first in time shall be the first in right. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to lessen, enlarge, or modify the existing rights of any riparian owner, or any existing right acquired by appropriation, or otherwise. They shall, however, be subject to condemnation as provided in RCW 90.03.040, and the amount and priority thereof may be determined by the procedure set out in RCW 90.03.110 through 90.03.240.

## 90.03.060 - Water masters—Appointment, compensation.
1. Water masters shall be appointed by the department whenever it shall find the interests of the state or of the water users to require them. The districts for or in which the water masters serve shall be designated water master districts, which shall be fixed from time to time by the department, as required, and they shall be subject to revision as to boundaries or to complete abandonment as local conditions may indicate to be expedient, the spirit of this provision being that no district shall be created or continued where the need for the same does not exist. Water masters shall be supervised by the department, shall be compensated for services from funds of the department, and shall be technically qualified to the extent of understanding the elementary principals of hydraulics and irrigation, and of being able to make water measurements in streams and in open and closed conduits of all characters, by the usual methods employed for that purpose. Counties and municipal and public corporations of the state are authorized to contribute moneys to the department to be used as compensation to water masters in carrying out their duties. All such moneys received by the department shall be used exclusively for said purpose.

2. A water master may be appointed by the department for a watershed management area for which a plan adopted by a planning unit and by the counties with territory in the watershed management area under RCW 90.82.130 contains a requirement or request that a water master be appointed, subject to availability of state or nonstate funding.

Supp. 1947 § 7359; \]

## 90.03.070 - Water masters—Duties—Office space and equipment—Clerical assistance.
It shall be the duty of the water master, acting under the direction of the department, to divide in whole or in part, the water supply of his or her district among the several water conduits and reservoirs using said supply, according to the right and priority of each, respectively. He or she shall divide, regulate, and control the use of water within his or her district by such regulation of headgates, conduits, and reservoirs as shall be necessary to prevent the use of water in excess of the amount to which the owner of the right is lawfully entitled. Whenever, in the pursuance of his or her duties, the water master regulates a headgate of a water conduit or the controlling works of a reservoir, he or she shall attach to such headgate or controlling works a written notice, properly dated and signed, stating that such headgate or controlling works has been properly regulated and is wholly under his or her control and such notice shall be a legal notice to all parties.

## 90.03.265 - Appropriation procedure—Cost-reimbursement agreement for expedited review of application—Adoption of rules.
1. [Empty]

   a. Any applicant for a new withdrawal or a change, transfer, or amendment of a water right pending before the department may initiate a cost-reimbursement agreement with the department to provide expedited review of the application. A cost-reimbursement agreement may be initiated under this section if the applicant agrees to pay for, or as part of a cooperative effort agrees to pay for, the cost of processing his or her application and all other applications from the same source of supply which must be acted upon before the applicant's request because they were filed prior to the date of when the applicant filed.

   b. The requirement to pay for the cost of other applications under (a) of this subsection does not apply to an application for a new appropriation that would not diminish the water available to earlier pending applicants for new appropriations from the same source of supply.

   c. The requirement to pay for the cost of processing other applications under (a) of this subsection does not apply to an application for a change, transfer, or other amendment that would not diminish the water available to earlier pending applicants for changes or transfers from the same source of supply.

   d. In determining whether an application would not diminish the water available to earlier pending applicants, the department shall consider any water impoundment or other water resource management mitigation technique proposed by the applicant under RCW 90.03.255 or 90.44.055.

   e. The department may enter into cost-reimbursement agreements provided resources are available and shall use the process established under RCW 43.21A.690 for entering into cost-reimbursement agreements. The department's share of work related to a cost-reimbursement application, such as final certificate approval, must be prioritized within the framework of other water right processing needs and as determined by agency rule.

   f. Each individual applicant is responsible for his or her own appeal costs that may result from a water right decision made by the department under this section. In the event that the department's approval of an application under this section is appealed under chapter 43.21B RCW by a third party, the applicant for the water right in question must reimburse the department for the cost of defending the decision before the pollution control hearings board unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant and the department. If an applicant appeals either an approval or a denial made by the department under this section, the applicant is responsible only for its own appeal costs.

2. In pursuing a cost-reimbursement project, the department must determine the source of water proposed to be diverted or withdrawn from, including the boundaries of the area that delimits the source. The department must determine if any other water right permit applications are pending from the same source. A water source may include surface water only, groundwater only, or surface and groundwater together if the department finds they are hydraulically connected. The department shall consider technical information submitted by the applicant in making its determinations under this subsection. The department may recover from a cost-reimbursement applicant its own costs in making the same source determination under this subsection.

3. Upon request of the applicant seeking cost-reimbursement processing, the department may elect to initiate a coordinated cost-reimbursement process. To initiate this process, the department must notify in writing all persons who have pending applications on file for a new appropriation, change, transfer, or amendment of a water right from that water source. A water source may include surface water only, groundwater only, or surface and groundwater together if the department determines that they are hydraulically connected. The notice must be posted on the department's website and published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where affected properties are located. The notice must also be made individually by way of mail to:

   a. Inform those applicants that cost-reimbursement processing of applications within the described water source is being initiated;

   b. Provide to individual applicants the criteria under which the applications will be examined and determined;

   c. Provide to individual applicants the estimated cost for having an application processed on a cost-reimbursement basis;

   d. Provide an estimate of how long the cost-reimbursement process will take before an application is approved or denied; and

   e. Provide at least sixty days for the applicants to respond in writing regarding the applicant's decision to participate in the cost-reimbursement process.

4. The applicant initiating the cost-reimbursement request must pay for the cost of the determination under subsections (2) and (3) of this section and other costs necessary for the initial phase of cost-reimbursement processing. The cost for each applicant for conducting processing under a coordinated cost-reimbursement agreement must be based primarily on the proportionate quantity of water requested by each applicant. The cost may be adjusted if it appears that an application will require a disproportionately greater amount of time and effort to process due to its complexity.

5. [Empty]

   a. Only the department may approve or deny a water right application processed under this section, and such a final decision remains solely the responsibility and function of the department. The department retains full authority to amend, refuse, or approve any work product provided by any consultant under this section. The department may recover its costs related to: (i) The review of a consultant to ensure that no conflict of interest exists; (ii) the management of consultant contracts and cost-reimbursement agreements; and (iii) the review of work products provided by participating consultants.

   b. For any cost-reimbursement process initiated under subsection (1) of this section, the applicant may, after consulting with the department, select a prequalified consultant listed by the department under subsection (7) of this section or may be assigned such a prequalified consultant by the department.

   c. For any coordinated cost-reimbursement process initiated under subsection (3) of this section, the applicant may, after consulting with the department, select a prequalified consultant listed by the department under subsection (7) of this section or may be assigned a prequalified consultant by the department.

   d. In lieu of having one or more of the work products performed by a prequalified consultant listed under subsection (7) of this section, the department may, at its discretion, recognize specific work completed by an applicant or an applicant's consultant prior to the initiation of cost-reimbursement processing. The department may also, at its discretion, authorize the use of such a consultant to perform a specific scope of the work that would otherwise be assigned to prequalified consultants listed under subsection (7) of this section.

   e. At any point during the cost-reimbursement process, the department may request or accept technical information, data, and analysis from the applicant or the applicant's consultant to support the cost-reimbursement process or the department's decision on the application.

6. The department is authorized to adopt rules or guidance providing minimum qualifications and standards for any consultant's submission of work products under this section, including standards for submission of technical information, scientific analysis, work product documentation, review for conflict of interest, and report presentation that such a consultant must meet.

7. The department must provide notice to potential consultants of the opportunity to be considered for inclusion on the list of cost-reimbursement consultants to whom work assignments will be made. The department must competitively select an appropriate number of consultants who are qualified by training and experience to investigate and make recommendations on the disposition of water right applications. The prequalified consultant list must be renewed at least every six years, though the department may add qualified cost-reimbursement consultants to the list at any time. The department must enter a master contract with each consultant selected and thereafter make work assignments based on availability and qualifications.

8. The department may remove any consultant from the consultant list for poor performance, malfeasance, or excessive complaints from cost-reimbursement participants. The department may interview any cost-reimbursement consultant to determine whether the person is qualified for this work, and must spot-check the work of consultants to ensure that the public is being competently served.

9. When a prequalified cost-reimbursement consultant from the department's list described in subsection (7) of this section is assigned or selected to investigate an application or set of applications, the consultant must document its findings and recommended disposition in the form of written draft technical reports and preliminary draft reports of examination. Within two weeks of the department receiving draft technical reports and preliminary draft reports of examination, the department shall provide the applicant such documents for review and comment prior to their completion by the consultant. The department shall consider such comments by the applicant prior to the department's issuance of a draft report of examination. The department may modify the preliminary draft reports of examination submitted by the consultant. The department's decision on a permit application is final unless it is appealed to the pollution control hearings board under chapter 43.21B RCW.

10. If an applicant elects not to participate in a cost-reimbursement process, the application remains on file with the department, retains its priority date, and may be processed under regular processing, priority processing, expedited processing, coordinated cost-reimbursement processing, cost-reimbursement processing, or through conservancy board processing as authorized under chapter 90.80 RCW.

## 90.03.290 - Appropriation procedure—Department to investigate—Preliminary permit—Findings and action on application.
1. When an application complying with the provisions of this chapter and with the rules of the department has been filed, the same shall be placed on record with the department, and it shall be its duty to investigate the application, and determine what water, if any, is available for appropriation, and find and determine to what beneficial use or uses it can be applied. If it is proposed to appropriate water for irrigation purposes, the department shall investigate, determine and find what lands are capable of irrigation by means of water found available for appropriation. If it is proposed to appropriate water for the purpose of power development, the department shall investigate, determine and find whether the proposed development is likely to prove detrimental to the public interest, having in mind the highest feasible use of the waters belonging to the public.

2. [Empty]

   a. If the application does not contain, and the applicant does not promptly furnish sufficient information on which to base such findings, the department may issue a preliminary permit, for a period of not to exceed three years, requiring the applicant to make such surveys, investigations, studies, and progress reports, as in the opinion of the department may be necessary. If the applicant fails to comply with the conditions of the preliminary permit, it and the application or applications on which it is based shall be automatically canceled and the applicant so notified. If the holder of a preliminary permit shall, before its expiration, file with the department a verified report of expenditures made and work done under the preliminary permit, which, in the opinion of the department, establishes the good faith, intent, and ability of the applicant to carry on the proposed development, the preliminary permit may, with the approval of the governor, be extended, but not to exceed a maximum period of five years from the date of the issuance of the preliminary permit.

For any application for which a preliminary permit was issued and for which the availability of water was directly affected by a moratorium on further diversions from the Columbia river during the years from 1990 to 1998, the preliminary permit is extended through June 30, 2002. If such an application and preliminary permit were canceled during the moratorium, the application and preliminary permit shall be reinstated until June 30, 2002, if the application and permit: (i) Are for providing regional water supplies in more than one urban growth area designated under chapter 36.70A RCW and in one or more areas near such urban growth areas, or the application and permit are modified for providing such supplies, and (ii) provide or are modified to provide such regional supplies through the use of existing intake or diversion structures. The authority to modify such a canceled application and permit to accomplish the objectives of (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection is hereby granted.

3. The department shall make and file as part of the record in the matter, written findings of fact concerning all things investigated, and if it shall find that there is water available for appropriation for a beneficial use, and the appropriation thereof as proposed in the application will not impair existing rights or be detrimental to the public welfare, it shall issue a permit stating the amount of water to which the applicant shall be entitled and the beneficial use or uses to which it may be applied: PROVIDED, That where the water applied for is to be used for irrigation purposes, it shall become appurtenant only to such land as may be reclaimed thereby to the full extent of the soil for agricultural purposes. But where there is no unappropriated water in the proposed source of supply, or where the proposed use conflicts with existing rights, or threatens to prove detrimental to the public interest, having due regard to the highest feasible development of the use of the waters belonging to the public, it shall be duty of the department to reject such application and to refuse to issue the permit asked for.

4. If the permit is refused because of conflict with existing rights and such applicant shall acquire same by purchase or condemnation under RCW 90.03.040, the department may thereupon grant such permit. Any application may be approved for a less amount of water than that applied for, if there exists substantial reason therefor, and in any event shall not be approved for more water than can be applied to beneficial use for the purposes named in the application. In determining whether or not a permit shall issue upon any application, it shall be the duty of the department to investigate all facts relevant and material to the application. After the department approves said application in whole or in part and before any permit shall be issued thereon to the applicant, such applicant shall pay the fee provided in RCW 90.03.470: PROVIDED FURTHER, That in the event a permit is issued by the department upon any application, it shall be its duty to notify the director of fish and wildlife of such issuance.

5. The requirements of subsections (1) and (3) of this section do not apply to water resource mitigation pilot projects for which permits are issued in reliance upon water resource mitigation of impacts to instream flows and closed surface water bodies under RCW 90.94.090.

## 90.03.330 - Appropriation procedure—Water right certificate.
1. Upon a showing satisfactory to the department that any appropriation has been perfected in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the department to issue to the applicant a certificate stating such facts in a form to be prescribed by the director, and such certificate shall thereupon be recorded with the department. Any original water right certificate issued, as provided by this chapter, shall be recorded with the department and thereafter, at the expense of the party receiving the same, be transmitted by the department to the county auditor of the county or counties where the distributing system or any part thereof is located, and be recorded in the office of such county auditor, and thereafter be transmitted to the owner thereof.

2. Except as provided for the issuance of certificates under RCW 90.03.240 and for the issuance of certificates following the approval of a change, transfer, or amendment under RCW 90.03.380 or 90.44.100, the department shall not revoke or diminish a certificate for a surface or ground water right for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015 unless the certificate was issued with ministerial errors or was obtained through misrepresentation. The department may adjust such a certificate under this subsection if ministerial errors are discovered, but only to the extent necessary to correct the ministerial errors. The department may diminish the right represented by such a certificate if the certificate was obtained through a misrepresentation on the part of the applicant or permit holder, but only to the extent of the misrepresentation. The authority provided by this subsection does not include revoking, diminishing, or adjusting a certificate based on any change in policy regarding the issuance of such certificates that has occurred since the certificate was issued. This subsection may not be construed as providing any authority to the department to revoke, diminish, or adjust any other water right.

3. This subsection applies to the water right represented by a water right certificate issued prior to September 9, 2003, for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015 where the certificate was issued based on an administrative policy for issuing such certificates once works for diverting or withdrawing and distributing water for municipal supply purposes were constructed rather than after the water had been placed to actual beneficial use. Such a water right is a right in good standing.

4. After September 9, 2003, the department must issue a new certificate under subsection (1) of this section for a water right represented by a water right permit only for the perfected portion of a water right as demonstrated through actual beneficial use of water.

1. [Empty]

   a. All applications for reservoir permits are subject to the provisions of RCW 90.03.250 through 90.03.320. But the party or parties proposing to apply to a beneficial use the water stored in any such reservoir shall also file an application for a permit, to be known as the secondary permit, which shall be in compliance with the provisions of RCW 90.03.250 through 90.03.320. Such secondary application shall refer to such reservoir as its source of water supply and shall show documentary evidence that an agreement has been entered into with the owners of the reservoir for a permanent and sufficient interest in said reservoir to impound enough water for the purposes set forth in said application. When the beneficial use has been completed and perfected under the secondary permit, the department shall take the proof of the water users under such permit and the final certificate of appropriation shall refer to both the ditch and works described in the secondary permit and the reservoir described in the primary permit. The department may accept for processing a single application form covering both a proposed reservoir and a proposed secondary permit or permits for use of water from that reservoir.

   b. The department shall expedite processing applications for the following types of storage proposals:

      i. Development of storage facilities that will not require a new water right for diversion or withdrawal of the water to be stored;

      ii. Adding or changing one or more purposes of use of stored water;

      iii. Adding to the storage capacity of an existing storage facility; and

      iv. Applications for secondary permits to secure use from existing storage facilities.

   c. A secondary permit for the beneficial use of water shall not be required for use of water stored in a reservoir where the water right for the source of the stored water authorizes the beneficial use.

2. [Empty]

   a. For the purposes of this section, "reservoir" includes, in addition to any surface reservoir, any naturally occurring underground geological formation where water is collected and stored for subsequent use as part of an underground artificial storage and recovery project. To qualify for issuance of a reservoir permit an underground geological formation must meet standards for review and mitigation of adverse impacts identified, for the following issues:

      i. Aquifer vulnerability and hydraulic continuity;

      ii. Potential impairment of existing water rights;

      iii. Geotechnical impacts and aquifer boundaries and characteristics;

      iv. Chemical compatibility of surface waters and groundwater;

      v. Recharge and recovery treatment requirements;

      vi. System operation;

      vii. Water rights and ownership of water stored for recovery; and

      viii. Environmental impacts.

   b. Standards for review and standards for mitigation of adverse impacts for an underground artificial storage and recovery project shall be established by the department by rule. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 90.03.250 through 90.03.320, analysis of each underground artificial storage and recovery project and each underground geological formation for which an applicant seeks the status of a reservoir shall be through applicant-initiated studies reviewed by the department.

3. For the purposes of this section, "underground artificial storage and recovery project" means any project in which it is intended to artificially store water in the ground through injection, surface spreading and infiltration, or other department-approved method, and to make subsequent use of the stored water. However, (a) this subsection does not apply to irrigation return flow, or to operational and seepage losses that occur during the irrigation of land, or to water that is artificially stored due to the construction, operation, or maintenance of an irrigation district project, or to projects involving water reclaimed in accordance with chapter 90.46 RCW; and (b) RCW 90.44.130 applies to those instances of claimed artificial recharge occurring due to the construction, operation, or maintenance of an irrigation district project or operational and seepage losses that occur during the irrigation of land, as well as other forms of claimed artificial recharge already existing at the time a groundwater subarea is established.

4. Nothing in chapter 98, Laws of 2000 changes the requirements of existing law governing issuance of permits to appropriate or withdraw the waters of the state.

5. The department shall report to the legislature by December 31, 2001, on the standards for review and standards for mitigation developed under subsection (3) of this section and on the status of any applications that have been filed with the department for underground artificial storage and recovery projects by that date.

6. Where needed to ensure that existing storage capacity is effectively and efficiently used to meet multiple purposes, the department may authorize reservoirs to be filled more than once per year or more than once per season of use.

7. This section does not apply to facilities to recapture and reuse return flow from irrigation operations serving a single farm under an existing water right as long as the acreage irrigated is not increased beyond the acreage allowed to be irrigated under the water right.

8. In addition to the facilities exempted under subsection (7) of this section, this section does not apply to small irrigation impoundments. For purposes of this section, "small irrigation impoundments" means lined surface storage ponds less than ten acre feet in volume used to impound irrigation water under an existing water right where use of the impoundment: (a)(i) Facilitates efficient use of water; or (ii) promotes compliance with an approved recovery plan for endangered or threatened species; and (b) does not expand the number of acres irrigated or the annual consumptive quantity of water used. Such ponds must be lined unless a licensed engineer determines that a liner is not needed to retain water in the pond and to prevent groundwater contamination. Although it may also be composed of other materials, a properly maintained liner may be composed of bentonite. Water remaining in a small irrigation impoundment at the end of an irrigation season may be carried over for use in the next season. However, the limitations of this subsection (8) apply. Development and use of a small irrigation impoundment does not constitute a change or amendment for purposes of RCW 90.03.380 or 90.44.055.

The point of diversion of water for beneficial use or the purpose of use may be changed, if such change can be made without detriment or injury to existing rights. A change in the place of use, point of diversion, and/or purpose of use of a water right to enable irrigation of additional acreage or the addition of new uses may be permitted if such change results in no increase in the annual consumptive quantity of water used under the water right. For purposes of this section, "annual consumptive quantity" means the estimated or actual annual amount of water diverted pursuant to the water right, reduced by the estimated annual amount of return flows, averaged over the two years of greatest use within the most recent five-year period of continuous beneficial use of the water right. Before any transfer of such right to use water or change of the point of diversion of water or change of purpose of use can be made, any person having an interest in the transfer or change, shall file a written application therefor with the department, and the application shall not be granted until notice of the application is published as provided in RCW 90.03.280. If it shall appear that such transfer or such change may be made without injury or detriment to existing rights, the department shall issue to the applicant a certificate in duplicate granting the right for such transfer or for such change of point of diversion or of use. The certificate so issued shall be filed and be made a record with the department and the duplicate certificate issued to the applicant may be filed with the county auditor in like manner and with the same effect as provided in the original certificate or permit to divert water.

2. If an application for change proposes to transfer water rights from one irrigation district to another, the department shall, before publication of notice, receive concurrence from each of the irrigation districts that such transfer or change will not adversely affect the ability to deliver water to other landowners or impair the financial integrity of either of the districts.

3. A change in place of use by an individual water user or users of water provided by an irrigation district need only receive approval for the change from the board of directors of the district if the use of water continues within the irrigation district, and when water is provided by an irrigation entity that is a member of a board of joint control created under chapter 87.80 RCW, approval need only be received from the board of joint control if the use of water continues within the area of jurisdiction of the joint board and the change can be made without detriment or injury to existing rights.

4. This section shall not apply to trust water rights acquired by the state through the funding of water conservation projects under chapter 90.38 RCW or RCW 90.42.010 through 90.42.070.

5. [Empty]

   a. Pending applications for new water rights are not entitled to protection from impairment, injury, or detriment when an application relating to an existing surface or ground water right is considered.

   b. Applications relating to existing surface or ground water rights may be processed and decisions on them rendered independently of processing and rendering decisions on pending applications for new water rights within the same source of supply without regard to the date of filing of the pending applications for new water rights.

   c. Notwithstanding any other existing authority to process applications, including but not limited to the authority to process applications under WAC 173-152-050 as it existed on January 1, 2001, an application relating to an existing surface or ground water right may be processed ahead of a previously filed application relating to an existing right when sufficient information for a decision on the previously filed application is not available and the applicant for the previously filed application is sent written notice that explains what information is not available and informs the applicant that processing of the next application will begin. The previously filed application does not lose its priority date and if the information is provided by the applicant within sixty days, the previously filed application shall be processed at that time. This subsection (5)(c) does not affect any other existing authority to process applications.

   d. Nothing in this subsection (5) is intended to stop the processing of applications for new water rights.

6. No applicant for a change, transfer, or amendment of a water right may be required to give up any part of the applicant's valid water right or claim to a state agency, the trust water rights program, or to other persons as a condition of processing the application.

7. In revising the provisions of this section and adding provisions to this section by chapter 237, Laws of 2001, the legislature does not intend to imply legislative approval or disapproval of any existing administrative policy regarding, or any existing administrative or judicial interpretation of, the provisions of this section not expressly added or revised.

8. The development and use of a small irrigation impoundment, as defined in RCW 90.03.370(8), does not constitute a change or amendment for the purposes of this section. The exemption expressly provided by this subsection shall not be construed as requiring a change or transfer of any existing water right to enable the holder of the right to store water governed by the right.

9. [Empty]

   a. The department may only approve an application submitted after June 30, 2019, for an interbasin water rights transfer after providing notice electronically to the board of county commissioners in the county of origin upon receipt of an application.

   b. For the purposes of this subsection:

      i. "Interbasin water rights transfer" means a transfer of a water right for which the proposed point of diversion is in a different basin than the proposed place of beneficial use.

      ii. "County of origin" means the county from which a water right is transferred or proposed to be transferred.

   c. This subsection applies to counties located east of the crest of the Cascade mountains.

## 90.03.383 - Interties—Findings—Definitions—Review and approval.
1. The legislature recognizes the value of interties for improving the reliability of public water systems, enhancing their management, and more efficiently utilizing the increasingly limited resource. Given the continued growth in the most populous areas of the state, the increased complexity of public water supply management, and the trend toward regional planning and regional solutions to resource issues, interconnections of public water systems through interties provide a valuable tool to ensure reliable public water supplies for the citizens of the state. Public water systems have been encouraged in the past to utilize interties to achieve public health and resource management objectives. The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to recognize interties existing and in use as of January 1, 1991, and to have associated water rights modified by the department of ecology to reflect current use of water through those interties, pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. The legislature further finds it in the public interest to develop a coordinated process to review proposals for interties commencing use after January 1, 1991.

2. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

   a. "Interties" are interconnections between public water systems permitting exchange or delivery of water between those systems for other than emergency supply purposes, where such exchange or delivery is within established instantaneous and annual withdrawal rates specified in the systems' existing water right permits or certificates, or contained in claims filed pursuant to chapter 90.14 RCW, and which results in better management of public water supply consistent with existing rights and obligations. Interties include interconnections between public water systems permitting exchange or delivery of water to serve as primary or secondary sources of supply, but do not include development of new sources of supply to meet future demand.

   b. "Service area" is the area designated in a water system plan or a coordinated water system plan pursuant to chapter 43.20 or 70A.100 RCW respectively. When a public water system does not have a designated service area subject to the approval process of those chapters, the service area shall be the designated place of use contained in the water right permit or certificate, or contained in the claim filed pursuant to chapter 90.14 RCW.

3. Public water systems with interties existing and in use as of January 1, 1991, or that have received written approval from the department of health prior to that date, shall file written notice of those interties with the department of health and the department of ecology. The notice may be incorporated into the public water system's five-year update of its water system plan, but shall be filed no later than June 30, 1996. The notice shall identify the location of the intertie; the dates of its first use; the purpose, capacity, and current use; the intertie agreement of the parties and the service areas assigned; and other information reasonably necessary to modify the water right permit. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 90.03.380 and 90.44.100, for public water systems with interties existing and in use as of January 1, 1991, the department of ecology, upon receipt of notice meeting the requirements of this subsection, shall, as soon as practicable, modify the place of use descriptions in the water right permits, certificates, or claims to reflect the actual use through such interties, provided that the place of use is within service area designations established in a water system plan approved pursuant to chapter 43.20 RCW, or a coordinated water system plan approved pursuant to chapter 70A.100 RCW, and further provided that the water used is within the instantaneous and annual withdrawal rates specified in the water right permit and that no outstanding complaints of impairment to existing water rights have been filed with the department of ecology prior to September 1, 1991. Where such complaints of impairment have been received, the department of ecology shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve them in a timely manner through agreement of the parties or through available administrative remedies.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 90.03.380 and 90.44.100, exchange or delivery of water through interties commencing use after January 1, 1991, shall be permitted when the intertie improves overall system reliability, enhances the manageability of the systems, provides opportunities for conjunctive use, or delays or avoids the need to develop new water sources, and otherwise meets the requirements of this section, provided that each public water system's water use shall not exceed the instantaneous or annual withdrawal rate specified in its water right authorization, shall not adversely affect existing water rights, and shall not be inconsistent with state-approved plans such as water system plans or other plans which include specific proposals for construction of interties. Interties commencing use after January 1, 1991, shall not be inconsistent with regional water resource plans developed pursuant to chapter 90.54 RCW.

5. For public water systems subject to the approval process of chapter 43.20 RCW or chapter 70A.100 RCW, proposals for interties commencing use after January 1, 1991, shall be incorporated into water system plans pursuant to chapter 43.20 RCW or coordinated water system plans pursuant to chapter 70A.100 RCW and submitted to the department of health and the department of ecology for review and approval as provided for in subsections (5) through (9) of this section. The plan shall state how the proposed intertie will improve overall system reliability, enhance the manageability of the systems, provide opportunities for conjunctive use, or delay or avoid the need to develop new water sources.

6. The department of health shall be responsible for review and approval of proposals for new interties. In its review the department of health shall determine whether the intertie satisfies the criteria of subsection (4) of this section, with the exception of water rights considerations, which are the responsibility of the department of ecology, and shall determine whether the intertie is necessary to address emergent public health or safety concerns associated with public water supply.

7. If the intertie is determined by the department of health to be necessary to address emergent public health or safety concerns associated with public water supply, the public water system shall amend its water system plan as required and shall file an application with the department of ecology to change its existing water right to reflect the proposed use of the water as described in the approved water system plan. The department of ecology shall process the application for change pursuant to RCW 90.03.380 or 90.44.100 as appropriate, except that, notwithstanding the requirements of those sections regarding notice and protest periods, applicants shall be required to publish notice one time, and the comment period shall be fifteen days from the date of publication of the notice. Within sixty days of receiving the application, the department of ecology shall issue findings and advise the department of health if existing water rights are determined to be adversely affected. If no determination is provided by the department of ecology within the sixty-day period, the department of health shall proceed as if existing rights are not adversely affected by the proposed intertie. The department of ecology may obtain an extension of the sixty-day period by submitting written notice to the department of health and to the applicant indicating a definite date by which its determination will be made. No additional extensions shall be granted, and in no event shall the total review period for the department of ecology exceed one hundred eighty days.

8. If the department of health determines the proposed intertie appears to meet the requirements of subsection (4) of this section but is not necessary to address emergent public health or safety concerns associated with public water supply, the department of health shall instruct the applicant to submit to the department of ecology an application for change to the underlying water right or claim as necessary to reflect the new place of use. The department of ecology shall consider the applications pursuant to the provisions of RCW 90.03.380 and 90.44.100 as appropriate. If in its review of proposed interties and associated water rights the department of ecology determines that additional information is required to act on the application, the department may request applicants to provide information necessary for its decision, consistent with agency rules and written guidelines. Parties disagreeing with the decision of the department of ecology on the application for change in place of use may appeal the decision to the pollution control hearings board.

9. The department of health may approve plans containing intertie proposals prior to the department of ecology's decision on the water right application for change in place of use. However, notwithstanding such approval, construction work on the intertie shall not begin until the department of ecology issues the appropriate water right document to the applicant consistent with the approved plan.

## 90.03.386 - Coordination of approval procedures for compliance and consistency with approved water system plan.
1. Within service areas established pursuant to chapter 43.20 or 70A.100 RCW, the department of ecology and the department of health shall coordinate approval procedures to ensure compliance and consistency with the approved water system plan or small water system management program.

2. The effect of the department of health's approval of a planning or engineering document that describes a municipal water supplier's service area under chapter 43.20 RCW, or the local legislative authority's approval of service area boundaries in accordance with procedures adopted pursuant to chapter 70A.100 RCW, is that the place of use of a surface water right or groundwater right used by the supplier includes any portion of the approved service area that was not previously within the place of use for the water right if the supplier is in compliance with the terms of the water system plan or small water system management program, including those regarding water conservation, and the alteration of the place of use is not inconsistent, regarding an area added to the place of use, with: Any comprehensive plans or development regulations adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW; any other applicable comprehensive plan, land use plan, or development regulation adopted by a city, town, or county; or any watershed plan approved under chapter 90.82 RCW, or a comprehensive watershed plan adopted under RCW 90.54.040(1) after September 9, 2003, if such a watershed plan has been approved for the area.

3. A municipal water supplier must implement cost-effective water conservation in accordance with the requirements of RCW 70A.125.170 as part of its approved water system plan or small water system management program. In preparing its regular water system plan update, a municipal water supplier with one thousand or more service connections must describe: (a) The projects, technologies, and other cost-effective measures that comprise its water conservation program; (b) improvements in the efficiency of water system use resulting from implementation of its conservation program over the previous six years; and (c) projected effects of delaying the use of existing inchoate rights over the next six years through the addition of further cost-effective water conservation measures before it may divert or withdraw further amounts of its inchoate right for beneficial use. When establishing or extending a surface or ground water right construction schedule under RCW 90.03.320, the department must take into consideration the public water system's use of conserved water.

## 90.03.390 - Temporary changes—Emergency interties—Rotation in use.
RCW 90.03.380 shall not be construed to prevent water users from making a seasonal or temporary change of point of diversion or place of use of water when such change can be made without detriment to existing rights, but in no case shall such change be made without the permission of the water master of the district in which such proposed change is located, or of the department. Nor shall RCW 90.03.380 be construed to prevent construction of emergency interties between public water systems to permit exchange of water during short-term emergency situations, or rotation in the use of water for bringing about a more economical use of the available supply, provided however, that the department of health in consultation with the department of ecology shall adopt rules or develop written guidelines setting forth standards for determining when a short-term emergency exists and the circumstances in which emergency interties are permitted. The rules or guidelines shall be consistent with the procedures established in RCW 43.83B.400 through 43.83B.420. Water users owning lands to which water rights are attached may rotate in the use of water to which they are collectively entitled, or an individual water user having lands to which are attached water rights of a different priority, may in like manner rotate in use when such rotation can be made without detriment to other existing water rights, and has the approval of the water master or department.

## 90.03.395 - Change of point of diversion to downstream intake structure—Intent.
The legislature intends to allow modification of the point of diversion in a water right permit when such a modification will provide both environmental benefits and water supply benefits and nothing in RCW 90.03.397 is to be construed as allowing any other change or transfer of a right to the use of surface water which has not been applied to a beneficial use.

\[ [1999 c 232 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1642.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%20232%20§%201); \]

## 90.03.397 - Department may approve change of the point of diversion prescribed in a permit to appropriate surface water—Requirements.
1. The department may approve a change of the point of diversion prescribed in a permit to appropriate surface water for a beneficial use if the ownership, purpose of use, season of use, and place of use of the permit remain the same to an approved intake structure with capacity to transport the additional diversion to either: (a) A point of diversion that is located downstream; or (b) a point of diversion located between Columbia river miles 215.6 and 292, if the existing point of diversion is contained therein.

2. This section may not be construed as limiting in any manner whatsoever other authorities of the department under RCW 90.03.380 or other changes that may be approved under RCW 90.03.380 under authorities existing before July 25, 1999.

## 90.03.500 - Stormwater control facilities—Imposition of rates and charges—Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that increasing the surface water or stormwater accumulation on or flow over real property, beyond that which naturally occurs on the real property, may cause severe damage to the real property and limit the gainful use or enjoyment of the real property, resulting in a tort, nuisance, or taking. The damage can arise from activities increasing the point or nonpoint flow of surface water or stormwater over the real property, or altering or interrupting the natural drainage from the real property. The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to permit the construction and operation of public improvements to lessen the damage. The legislature further finds that it is in the public interest to provide for the equitable imposition of special assessments, rates, and charges to fund such improvements. This shall include the imposition of special assessments, rates, and charges on real property to fund that reasonable portion of the public improvements that alleviate the damage arising from activities that are the proximate cause of the damage on other real property. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 90.03.525, these special assessments, rates, and charges may be imposed on any publicly-owned, including state-owned, real property that causes such damage.

\[ [1986 c 278 § 62](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c278.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20278%20§%2062); [1983 c 315 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c315.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20315%20§%208); \]

## 90.03.510 - Stormwater control facilities—Imposition of rates and charges—Credit for other improvements.
Whenever a county, city, town, water-sewer district, or flood control zone district imposes rates or charges to fund stormwater control facilities or improvements and the operation and maintenance of such facilities or improvements under RCW 35.67.020, 35.92.020, 36.89.080, 36.94.140, 57.08.005, or 57.08.081, it may provide a credit for the value of stormwater control facilities or improvements that a person or entity has installed or located that mitigate or lessen the impact of stormwater which otherwise would occur.

## 90.03.520 - Stormwater control facilities—Imposition of rates and charges—Definitions.
The definitions set forth in this section apply to RCW 90.03.525 and 35.67.025.

1. "State highway right-of-way" means the right-of-way for a state highway. The phrase includes the right-of-way of a state limited access highway inside or outside a city or town but does not include city or town streets forming a part of the route of state highways that are not limited access highways. The term does not include state property under the jurisdiction of the department of transportation that is outside the right-of-way lines of a state highway.

2. "Stormwater control facility" means any facility, improvement, development, property, or interest therein, made, constructed, or acquired for the purpose of controlling, or protecting life or property from, any storm, waste, flood, or surplus waters.

3. "Rate" means the dollar amount charged per unit of surface area of a parcel of real property based upon factors established by the local government utility.

4. "Comparable real property" means real property equal to the state highway right-of-way or a section of state highway right-of-way in terms of the factors considered by the local government utility in establishing rates.

\[ [1986 c 278 § 53](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c278.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20278%20§%2053); \]

## 90.03.525 - Stormwater control facilities—Imposition of rates and charges with respect to state highway rights-of-way—Annual plan for expenditure of charges.
1. The rate charged by a local government utility to the department of transportation with respect to state highway right-of-way or any section of state highway right-of-way for the construction, operation, and maintenance of stormwater control facilities under chapters 35.67, 35.92, 36.89, 36.94, 57.08, and 86.15 RCW, shall be thirty percent of the rate for comparable real property, except as otherwise provided in this section. The rate charged to the department with respect to state highway right-of-way or any section of state highway right-of-way within a local government utility's jurisdiction shall not, however, exceed the rate charged for comparable city street or county road right-of-way within the same jurisdiction. The legislature finds that the aforesaid rates are presumptively fair and equitable because of the traditional and continuing expenditures of the department of transportation for the construction, operation, and maintenance of stormwater control facilities designed to control surface water or stormwater runoff from state highway rights-of-way.

2. Charges paid under subsection (1) of this section by the department of transportation must be used solely for stormwater control facilities that directly reduce state highway runoff impacts or implementation of best management practices that will reduce the need for such facilities. By January 1st of each year, beginning with calendar year 2020, the local government utility, in coordination with the department of transportation, shall develop a plan for the expenditure of the charges for that calendar year. The plan must be consistent with the objectives identified in former RCW 90.78.010. In addition, the utility shall provide a progress report on the use of charges assessed for the prior year. No charges may be paid until the plan and report have been submitted to the department of transportation.

3. The utility imposing the charge and the department of transportation may, however, agree to either higher or lower rates with respect to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any specific stormwater control facilities based upon the annual plan prescribed in subsection (2) of this section. If, after mediation, the local government utility and the department of transportation cannot agree upon the proper rate, either may commence an action in the superior court for the county in which the state highway right-of-way is located to establish the proper rate. The court in establishing the proper rate shall take into account the extent and adequacy of stormwater control facilities constructed by the department and the actual benefits to the sections of state highway rights-of-way from stormwater control facilities constructed, operated, and maintained by the local government utility. Control of surface water runoff and stormwater runoff from state highway rights-of-way shall be deemed an actual benefit to the state highway rights-of-way. The rate for sections of state highway right-of-way as determined by the court shall be set forth in terms of the percentage of the rate for comparable real property, but shall in no event exceed the rate charged for comparable city street or county road right-of-way within the same jurisdiction.

4. The legislature finds that the federal clean water act (national pollutant discharge elimination system, 40 C.F.R. parts 122-124), the state water pollution control act, chapter 90.48 RCW, and the highway runoff program under chapter 90.71 RCW, mandate the treatment and control of stormwater runoff from state highway rights-of-way owned by the department of transportation. Appropriations made by the legislature to the department of transportation for the construction, operation, and maintenance of stormwater control facilities are intended to address applicable federal and state mandates related to stormwater control and treatment. This section is not intended to limit opportunities for sharing the costs of stormwater improvements between cities, counties, and the state.

## 90.03.560 - Municipal water supply purposes—Identification.
When requested by a municipal water supplier or when processing a change or amendment to the right, the department shall amend the water right documents and related records to ensure that water rights that are for municipal water supply purposes, as defined in RCW 90.03.015, are correctly identified as being for municipal water supply purposes. This section authorizes a water right or portion of a water right held or acquired by a municipal water supplier that is for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015 to be identified as being a water right for municipal water supply purposes. However, it does not authorize any other water right or other portion of a right held or acquired by a municipal water supplier to be so identified without the approval of a change or transfer of the right or portion of the right for such a purpose.

## 90.03.570 - Change or transfer of an unperfected surface water right for municipal water supply purposes.
1. An unperfected surface water right for municipal water supply purposes or a portion thereof held by a municipal water supplier may be changed or transferred in the same manner as provided by RCW 90.03.380 for any purpose if:

   a. The supplier is in compliance with the terms of an approved water system plan or small water system management program under chapter 43.20 or 70A.100 RCW that applies to the supplier, including those regarding water conservation;

   b. Instream flows have been established by rule for the water resource inventory area, as established in chapter 173-500 WAC as it exists on September 9, 2003, that is the source of the water for the transfer or change;

   c. A watershed plan has been approved for the water resource inventory area referred to in (b) of this subsection under chapter 90.82 RCW and a detailed implementation plan has been completed that satisfies the requirements of RCW 90.82.043 or a watershed plan has been adopted after September 9, 2003, for that water resource inventory area under RCW 90.54.040(1) and a detailed implementation plan has been completed that satisfies the requirements of RCW 90.82.043; and

   d. Streamflows that satisfy the instream flows referred to in (b) of this subsection are met or the milestones for satisfying those instream flows required under (c) of this subsection are being met.

2. If the criteria listed in subsection (1)(a) through (d) of this section are not satisfied, an unperfected surface water right for municipal water supply purposes or a portion thereof held by a municipal water supplier may nonetheless be changed or transferred in the same manner as provided by RCW 90.03.380 if the change or transfer is:

   a. To provide water for an instream flow requirement that has been established by the department by rule;

   b. Subject to streamflow protection or restoration requirements contained in: A federally approved habitat conservation plan under the federal endangered species act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq., a hydropower license of the federal energy regulatory commission, or a watershed agreement established under RCW 90.03.590;

   c. For a water right that is subject to instream flow requirements or agreements with the department and the change or transfer is also subject to those instream flow requirements or agreements; or

## 90.03.620 - Water rights adjudication—Disqualification of judge.
1. A judge in a water right adjudication filed under this chapter may be partially or fully disqualified from hearing the adjudication. Partial disqualification means disqualification from hearing specified claims. Full disqualification means disqualification from hearing any aspect of the adjudication.

   a. A judge is partially disqualified when the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the apparent or actual partiality is limited to specified claims.

   b. A judge is fully disqualified when the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the apparent or actual partiality extends beyond limited claims such that the judge should not hear any part of the adjudication.

2. A judge may recuse himself or herself under this section or a party may file a motion for disqualification. A motion for disqualification must state whether the remedy being sought is full or partial disqualification.

3. [Empty]

   a. For parties who are named in the original pleadings, a motion for disqualification is timely if it is filed before the judge issues a discretionary order or ruling in the adjudication.

   b. For a party who is joined in the adjudication after the original pleadings have been filed, a motion for disqualification is timely if it is filed within the earliest of either (i) thirty days of being joined in the adjudication; or (ii) after the joinder of the party, before the judge issues a discretionary order or ruling relating to the joined party.

   c. When a motion for disqualification is untimely filed under this subsection (3), the motion will be granted only when necessary to correct a substantial injustice.

   d. For purposes of this section, "discretionary order or ruling" has the same meaning as "order or ruling involving discretion" in RCW 4.12.050.

4. A party filing a motion for disqualification under this section has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the judge should be disqualified under the standards of subsection (1) of this section.

5. The motion for disqualification may not be heard by the judge against whom the motion is filed. Subject to this limitation, the court may assign the disqualification motion to any superior court judge of the judicial district in which the adjudication was filed or to a visiting superior court judge under RCW 2.56.040.

6. The standards set forth in RCW 2.28.030, which govern the disqualification of judicial officers generally, may be grounds for disqualification under this section.

## 90.03.630 - Water rights adjudication—Use for which a statement of claim is required.
If an adjudication claim is for a use for which a statement of claim was required to be filed under chapter 90.14 RCW and no such claim was filed, the department may move that the adjudication claim be denied. The court shall grant the department's motion unless the claimant shows good cause why the motion should not be granted.

\[ [2009 c 332 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1571-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20332%20§%205); \]

## 90.03.635 - Water rights adjudication—Filing of evidence.

The evidence filed may include matters that are outside the original adjudication claim filed, and within the date set by the court for filing evidence, the claimant may amend the adjudication claim to conform to the evidence filed. Thereafter, except for good cause shown, a claimant may not file additional evidence to support the claim.

\[ [2009 c 332 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1571-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20332%20§%208); \]

## 90.03.640 - Water rights adjudication—Preliminary investigation—Department's report of findings.
1. Upon the receipt of adjudication claims and the filing of claimants' evidence, the department shall conduct a preliminary investigation for the purpose of examining:

   a. The uses of the subject waters by and any physical works in connection with the persons to whom the adjudication applies; and

   b. The uses for which a statement of claim has been filed under chapter 90.14 RCW or for which the department has a permit or certificate of water right on record.

2. [Empty]

   a. The examination may include, as the department deems appropriate: 

      i. An estimation of the amount of water that is reasonably necessary to accomplish various beneficial uses within the area;

      ii. The measurement of streamflows;

      iii. The measurement of any diversion or withdrawal rates;

      iv. An estimation of storage capacity and the amount of water stored;

      v. The types and numbers of stock watered;

      vi. The number of residences served;

      vii. The location and size of any irrigated land areas; and

      viii. Any other information pertinent to the determination of water rights in an adjudication under this chapter.

   b. The department may also take other necessary steps and gather other data and information as may be essential to the proper understanding of the water uses and associated rights of the affected water users, including review of each claimant's adjudication claim and evidence the claimant filed to support the claim. The claimants and the department are encouraged to confer as may be beneficial to clarify the factual and legal basis for the claim. To the extent consistent with court rules, the court may deem it appropriate to encourage claimants and the department to work closely together to reach agreement on a claimed water right that may result in timely settlement of water rights, reduced costs for the parties, greater equity and general public service, and better information that may be used for overall water management.

3. The department shall file with the court the department's report of findings as to each adjudication claim filed timely under RCW 90.03.140. The department may divide its report of findings into two or more segments, covering particular drainages, uses, or other appropriate bases for dividing the report on adjudication claims. Based on the evidence filed by claimants and the department's report of findings, the department shall file with the superior court either or both of the following motions:

   a. A motion for a partial decree in favor of all stated claims under RCW 90.03.140 that the department finds to be substantiated with factual evidence; or

   b. A motion seeking determination of contested claims before the court.

## 90.03.645 - Water rights adjudication—Early settlement encouraged—Approval of settlement.
1. The legislature finds that early settlement of contested claims is needed for a fair and efficient adjudication of water rights. Therefore, the department and other parties should identify opportunities for settlement following the date set by the court for filing evidence for all parties. To the extent consistent with court rules, the court as it deems beneficial is encouraged to urge as many parties to the adjudication as possible to reach timely agreement on claimed water rights in a manner that limits costs to the public, claimants, counties, courts, and the department. Further, at appropriate times throughout the process the court as it deems beneficial is encouraged to direct parties to utilize alternative methods of dispute resolution, including informal meetings, negotiation, mediation, or other methods to reach agreement on disputed claims.

2. Any time after the filing of all claims under RCW 90.03.140, the department or another party may move the superior court to allow parties to meet for settlement discussions for a set length of time, either before an appointed mediator or without a mediator. For good cause shown, the court may extend the length of time for settlement discussions. The costs of mediation must be equitably borne by the parties to the mediation.

3. If the department and a claimant reach agreement on settlement, the department shall file a motion to approve the settlement pursuant to RCW 90.03.640(3)(a) and shall disclose the terms of the settlement to other parties to the adjudication. The court shall conduct a hearing prior to approving a settlement and any party to the adjudication may object or offer modifications to the settlement.

## 90.03.650 - Water rights processing account.
The water rights processing account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the fees collected under RCW 90.03.655, 90.03.665, and 90.44.540 must be deposited into the account. Money in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may only be used to support the processing of water right applications for a new appropriation, change, transfer, or amendment of a water right as provided in this chapter and chapters 90.42 and 90.44 RCW or for the examination, certification, and renewal of certification of water right examiners as provided in RCW 90.03.665. During the 2015-2017 fiscal biennium the legislature may transfer from the water rights processing account to the state drought preparedness account.

\[ [2016 sp.s. c 36 § 949](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2376-S.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20sp.s.%20c%2036%20§%20949); [2010 c 285 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6267-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20285%20§%204); \]

## 90.03.655 - Expedited processing of applications—On department's own volition—Notice—Fees.
1. The department may expedite processing of applications within the same source of water on its own volition when there is interest from a sufficient number of applicants or upon receipt of written requests from at least ten percent of the applicants within the same source of water.

2. If the conditions of subsection (1) of this section have been met and the department determines that the public interest is best served by expediting applications within a water source, the department must notify in writing all persons who have pending applications on file for a new appropriation, change, transfer, or amendment of a water right from that water source. A water source may include surface water only, groundwater only, or surface and groundwater together if the department determines that they are hydraulically connected. The notice must be posted on the department's website and published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where affected properties are located. The notice must also be made individually by way of mail to:

   a. Inform those applicants that expedited processing of applications within the described water source is being initiated;

   b. Provide to individual applicants the criteria under which the applications will be examined and determined;

   c. Provide to individual applicants the estimated cost for having an application processed on an expedited basis;

   d. Provide an estimate of how long the expedited process will take before an application is approved or denied; and

   e. Provide at least sixty days for the applicants to respond in writing regarding the applicant's decision to participate in the expedited processing of their applications.

3. In addition to the application fees provided in RCW 90.03.470, the department must recover the full cost of processing all the applications from applicants who elect to participate within the water source through expedited processing fees. The department must calculate an expedited processing fee based primarily on the proportionate quantity of water requested by each applicant and may adjust the fee if it appears that the application will require a disproportionately greater amount of time and effort to process due to its complexity. Any application fees that were paid by the applicant under RCW 90.03.470 must be credited against the applicant's share of the cost of processing applications under the provisions of this section.

4. The expedited processing fee must be collected by the department prior to the expedited processing of an application. Revenue collected from these fees must be deposited into the water rights processing account created in RCW 90.03.650. An applicant who has stated in writing that he or she wants his or her application processed using the expedited procedures in this section must transmit the processing fee within sixty days of the written request. Failure to do so will result in the applicant not being included in expedited processing for that water source.

5. If an applicant elects not to participate in expedited processing, the application remains on file with the department, the applicant retains his or her priority date, and the application may be processed through regular processing, priority processing, expedited processing, coordinated cost-reimbursement processing, cost-reimbursement processing, or through conservancy board processing as authorized under chapter 90.80 RCW. Such an application may not be processed through expedited processing within twelve months after the department's issuance of decisions on participating applications at the conclusion of expedited processing unless the applicant agrees to pay the full proportionate share that would otherwise have been paid during such processing. Any proceeds collected from an applicant under this delayed entry into expedited processing shall be used to reimburse the other applicants who participated in the previous expedited processing of applications, provided sufficient proceeds remain to fully cover the department's cost of processing the delayed entry application and the department's estimated administrative costs to reimburse the previously expedited applicants.

\[ [2010 c 285 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6267-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20285%20§%205); \]

Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, upon completion of a water appropriation and putting water to beneficial use, in order to receive a final water right certificate, the permit holder must secure the services of a certified water right examiner who has been tested and certified by the department. The examiner shall carry out a final examination of the project to verify its completion and to determine and document for the permit holder and the department the amount of water that has been appropriated for beneficial use, the location of diversion or withdrawal and conveyance facilities, and the actual place of use. The examiner shall take measurements or make estimates of the maximum diversion or withdrawal, the capacity of water storage facilities, the acreage irrigated, the type and number of residences served, the type and number of stock watered, and other information relevant to making a final determination of the amount of water beneficially used. The examiner shall take photographs of the facilities to document the use or uses of water and the photographs must be submitted with the examiner's report to the department. The department shall specify the format and required content of the reports and may provide a form for that purpose.

4. The department may suspend or revoke a certification based on poor performance, malfeasance, failure to acquire continuing education credits, or excessive complaints from the examiner's customers. The department may require the retesting of an examiner. The department may interview any examiner to determine whether the person is qualified for this work. The department shall spot-check the work of examiners to ensure that the public is being competently served. Any person aggrieved by an order of the department including the granting, denial, revocation, or suspension of a certificate issued by the department under this chapter may appeal pursuant to chapter 43.21B RCW.

5. The decision regarding whether to issue a final water right certificate is solely the responsibility and function of the department.

6. The department shall make its final decision under RCW 90.03.330 within sixty days of the date of receipt of the proof of examination from the certified water right examiner, unless otherwise requested by the applicant or returned for correction by the department. The department may return an initial proof of examination for correction within thirty days of the department's receipt of such initial proof from a certified water right examiner. Such proof must be returned to both the certified water right examiner and the applicant.
