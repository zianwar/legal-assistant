## 90.08.040 - Stream patroller—Appointment—Powers.
Where water rights of a stream have been adjudicated a stream patroller shall be appointed by the director of the department of ecology upon application of water users having adjudicated water rights in each particular water resource making a reasonable showing of the necessity therefor, which application shall have been approved by the district water master if one has been appointed, at such time, for such stream, and for such periods of service as local conditions may indicate to be necessary to provide the most practical supervision and to secure to water users and owners the best protection in their rights.

The stream patroller shall have the same powers as a water master appointed under RCW 90.03.060, but his or her district shall be confined to the regulation of waters of a designated stream or streams. Such patroller shall be under the supervision of the director or his or her designated representative. He or she shall also enforce such special rules and regulations as the director may prescribe from time to time.

## 90.08.060 - Stream patrollers—Users to share in payment of compensation.
The salary of the stream patroller shall be borne by the water users receiving the benefits and shall be paid to the county or counties in the following manner:

The county or counties may assess each water user for his or her proportionate share of the total stream patroller expense in the same ratio that the amount of water diverted by him or her bears to the total amount diverted from the stream during each season, on an annual basis, to recover all such county expenses. The stream patroller shall keep an accurate record of the amount of water diverted by each water user coming under his or her supervision. On the first of each month the stream patroller shall present his or her record of water diversion to the county or counties for the preceding month. Where the water users are organized into an irrigation district or water users' association, such organization may enter into an agreement with the county or counties for direct payment to the stream patroller in order to minimize administrative costs.
