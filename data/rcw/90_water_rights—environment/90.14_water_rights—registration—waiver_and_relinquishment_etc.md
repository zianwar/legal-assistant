## 90.14.010 - Purpose.
The future growth and development of the state is dependent upon effective management and efficient use of the state's water resources. The purpose of this chapter is to provide adequate records for efficient administration of the state's waters, and to cause a return to the state of any water rights which are no longer exercised by putting said waters to beneficial use.

\[ [1967 c 233 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c233.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20233%20§%201); \]

## 90.14.020 - Legislative declaration.
The legislature finds that:

1. Extensive uncertainty exists regarding the volume of private claims to water in the state;

2. Such uncertainty seriously retards the efficient utilization and administration of the state's water resources, and impedes the fullest beneficial use thereof;

3. A strong beneficial use requirement as a condition precedent to the continued ownership of a right to withdraw or divert water is essential to the orderly development of the state;

4. Enforcement of the state's beneficial use policy is required by the state's rapid growth;

5. All rights to divert or withdraw water, except riparian rights which do not diminish the quantity of water remaining in the source such as boating, swimming, and other recreational and aesthetic uses must be subjected to the beneficial use requirement;

6. The availability for appropriation of additional water as a result of the requirements of this chapter will accelerate growth, development, and diversification of the economy of the state;

7. Water rights will gain sufficient certainty of ownership as a result of this chapter to become more freely transferable, thereby increasing the economic value of the uses to which they are put, and augmenting the alienability of titles to land.

\[ [1967 c 233 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c233.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20233%20§%202); \]

## 90.14.031 - Definitions.
Unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context, the following words and phrases as used in RCW 90.14.031 through 90.14.121 shall have the following meanings:

1. "Person" shall mean an individual, partnership, association, public or private corporation, city or other municipality, county, or a state agency, and the United States of America when claiming water rights established under the laws of the state of Washington.

2. "Beneficial use" shall include, but not be limited to, use for domestic water, irrigation, fish, shellfish, game and other aquatic life, municipal, recreation, industrial water, generation of electric power, and navigation.

\[ [1969 ex.s. c 284 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969ex1c284.pdf?cite=1969%20ex.s.%20c%20284%20§%2012); \]

## 90.14.041 - Claim of right to withdraw, divert or use ground or surface waters—Filing statement of claim required—Exemptions.
All persons using or claiming the right to withdraw or divert and make beneficial use of public surface or ground waters of the state, except as provided in this section, RCW 90.14.043, and 90.14.068, shall file with the department of ecology not later than June 30, 1974, a statement of claim for each water right asserted on a form provided by the department. Neither this section nor RCW 90.14.068 apply to any water rights which are based on the authority of a permit or certificate issued by the department of ecology or one of its predecessors. Further, RCW 90.14.068 does not apply to the beneficial uses of water which are the subject of statements of claim in the water rights claims registry prior to September 1, 1997, or which are exempted from permit and application requirements by RCW 90.44.050 and neither this section nor RCW 90.14.068 requires that statements of claims for such uses be filed during the filing period established by RCW 90.14.068.

\[ [1997 c 440 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1118-S.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20440%20§%202); [1988 c 127 § 73](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c127.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20127%20§%2073); [1969 ex.s. c 284 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969ex1c284.pdf?cite=1969%20ex.s.%20c%20284%20§%2013); \]

## 90.14.043 - Claim of right to withdraw, divert or use ground or surface waters—Claim upon certification by board—Procedure—Cut-off date for accepting petitions.
1. Notwithstanding any time restrictions imposed by the provisions of chapter 90.14 RCW, a person may file a claim pursuant to RCW 90.14.041 if such person obtains a certification from the pollution control hearings board as provided in this section.

2. A certification shall be issued by the pollution control hearings board if, upon petition to the board, it is shown to the satisfaction of the board that:

   a. Waters of the state have been applied to beneficial use continuously (with no period of nonuse exceeding five consecutive years) in the case of surface water beginning not later than June 7, 1917, and in the case of groundwater beginning not later than June 7, 1945, or

   b. Waters of the state have been applied to beneficial use continuously (with no period of nonuse exceeding five consecutive years) from the date of entry of a court decree confirming a water right and any failure to register a claim resulted from a reasonable misinterpretation of the requirements as they related to such court decreed rights.

3. The board shall have jurisdiction to accept petitions for certification from any person through September 1, 1985, and not thereafter.

4. A petition for certification shall include complete information on the claim pursuant to RCW 90.14.051 (1) through (8), and any such information as the board may require.

5. The department of ecology is directed to accept for filing any claim certified by the board as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The department of ecology, upon request of the board, may provide assistance to the board pertinent to any certification petition.

6. A certification by the pollution control hearings board or a filing with the department of ecology of a claim under this section shall not constitute a determination or confirmation that a water right exists.

7. The provisions of RCW 90.14.071 shall have no applicability to certified claims filed pursuant to this section.

8. This section shall have no applicability to groundwaters resulting from the operations of reclamation projects.

\[ [1985 c 435 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c435.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20435%20§%201); [1979 ex.s. c 216 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c216.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%20216%20§%204); \]

The provisions of chapter 435, Laws of 1985 authorizing the acceptance of a petition for certification filed during the period beginning on July 28, 1985, and ending on midnight, September 1, 1985, shall not affect or impair in any respect whatsoever any water right existing prior to July 28, 1985.

\[ [1985 c 435 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c435.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20435%20§%202); \]

## 90.14.065 - Statement of claim—Amendment—Surface water right claim change or transfer—Review of department of ecology's determination.
1. [Empty]

   a. Any person or entity, or successor to such person or entity, having a statement of claim on file with the water rights claims registry may submit to the department of ecology for filing an amendment to such a statement of claim if the submitted amendment is based on:

      i. An error in estimation of the quantity of the applicant's water claim prescribed in RCW 90.14.051 if the applicant provides reasons for the failure to claim such right in the original claim;

      ii. A change in circumstances not foreseeable at the time the original claim was filed, if such change in circumstances relates only to the manner of transportation or diversion of the water and not to the use or quantity of such water; or

      iii. The amendment is ministerial in nature.

   b. The department shall accept any such submission and file the same in the registry unless the department by written determination concludes that the requirements of (a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection have not been satisfied.

2. In addition to subsection (1) of this section, a surface water right claim may be changed or transferred in the same manner as a permit or certificate under RCW 90.03.380, and a water right claim for groundwater may be changed or transferred as provided under RCW 90.03.380 and 90.44.100.

3. Any person aggrieved by a determination of the department may obtain a review thereof by filing a petition for review with the pollution control hearings board within thirty days of the date of the determination by the department.

## 90.14.068 - Statement of claim—New filing period.
1. A new period for filing statements of claim for water rights is established. The filing period shall begin September 1, 1997, and shall end at midnight June 30, 1998. Each person or entity claiming under state law a right to withdraw or divert and beneficially use surface water under a right that was established before *the effective date of [the] water code established by chapter 117, Laws of 1917, and any person claiming under state law a right to withdraw and beneficially use groundwater under a right that was established before **the effective date of the groundwater code established by chapter 263, Laws of 1945, shall register the claim with the department during the filing period unless the claim has been filed in the state water rights claims registry before July 27, 1997. A person who claims such a right and fails to register the claim as required is conclusively deemed to have waived and relinquished any right, title, or interest in the right. A statement filed during this filing period shall be filed as provided in RCW 90.14.051 and 90.14.061 and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter regarding statements of claim. This reopening of the period for filing statements of claim shall not affect or impair in any respect whatsoever any water right existing prior to July 27, 1997. A water right embodied in a statement of claim filed under this section is subordinate to any water right embodied in a permit or certificate issued under chapter 90.03 or 90.44 RCW prior to the date the statement of claim is filed with the department and is subordinate to any water right embodied in a statement of claim filed in the water rights claims registry before July 27, 1997.

2. The department of ecology shall, at least once each week during the month of August 1997 and at least once each month during the filing period, publish a notice regarding this new filing period in newspapers of general circulation in the various regions of the state. The notice shall contain the substance of the following notice:

WATER RIGHTS NOTICE

Each person or entity claiming a right to withdraw or divert and beneficially use surface water under a right that was established before June 7, 1917, or claiming a right to withdraw and beneficially use groundwater under a right that was established before June 7, 1945, under the laws of the state of Washington must register the claim with the department of ecology, Olympia, Washington. The claim must be registered on or after September 1, 1997, and not later than five o'clock on June 30, 1998.

 FAILURE TO REGISTER THE CLAIM WILL RESULT IN A WAIVER AND RELINQUISHMENT OF THE WATER RIGHT OR CLAIMED WATER RIGHT 

 

FAILURE TO REGISTER THE CLAIM WILL RESULT IN A WAIVER AND RELINQUISHMENT OF THE WATER RIGHT OR CLAIMED WATER RIGHT

 

Registering a claim is NOT required for:

1. A water right that is based on the authority of a permit or certificate issued by the department of ecology or one of its predecessors;

2. A water right that is based on the exemption from permitting requirements provided by RCW 90.44.050 for certain very limited uses of groundwater; or

3. A water right that is based on a statement of claim that has previously been filed in the state's water rights claims registry during other registration periods.

For further information, for a copy of the law establishing this filing period, and for an explanation of the law and its requirements, contact the department of ecology, Olympia, Washington.

The department shall also prepare, make available to the public, and distribute to the communications media information describing the types of rights for which statements of claim need not be filed, the effect of filing, the effect of RCW 90.14.071, and other information relevant to filings and statements of claim.

3. The department of ecology shall ensure that employees of the department are readily available to respond to inquiries regarding filing statements of claim and that all of the information the department has at its disposal that is relevant to an inquiry regarding a particular potential claim, including information regarding other rights and claims in the vicinity of the potentially claimed right, is available to the person making the inquiry. The department shall dedicate additional staff in each of the department's regional offices and in the department's central office to ensure that responses and information are provided in a timely manner during each of the business days during the month of August 1997 and during the new filing period.

4. To assist the department in avoiding unnecessary duplication, the department shall provide to a requestor, within ten working days of receiving the request, the records of any water right claimed, listed, recorded, or otherwise existing in the records of the department or its predecessor agencies, including any report of a referee in a water rights adjudication. This information shall be provided as required by this subsection if the request is provided in writing from the owner of the water right or from the holder of a possessory interest in any real property for water right records associated with the property or if the requestor is an attorney for such an owner. The information regarding water rights in the area served by a regional office of the department shall also be provided within ten working days to any requestor who requests to review the information in person in the department's regional office. The information held by the headquarters office of the department shall also be provided within ten working days to any requestor who requests to review the information in person in the department's headquarters office. The requirements of this subsection that records and information be provided to requestors within ten working days may not be construed as limiting in any manner the obligations of the department to provide public access to public records as required by chapter 42.56 RCW.

5. This section does not apply to claims for the use of groundwater withdrawn in an area that is, during the period established by subsection (2) of this section, the subject of a general adjudication proceeding for water rights in superior court under RCW 90.03.110 through 90.03.245 and the proceeding applies to groundwater rights. This section does not apply to claims for the use of surface water withdrawn in an area that is, during the period established by subsection (2) of this section, the subject of a general adjudication proceeding for water rights in superior court under RCW 90.03.110 through 90.03.245 and the proceeding applies to surface water rights.

6. This section does not apply to claims for the use of water in a groundwater area or subarea for which a management program adopted by the department by rule and in effect on July 27, 1997, establishes acreage expansion limitations for the use of groundwater.

## 90.14.071 - Failure to file claim waives and relinquishes right.
Except as provided in *section 5 of this act or as exempted from filing by RCW 90.14.041, any person claiming the right to divert or withdraw waters of the state as set forth in RCW 90.14.041, who fails to file a statement of claim as provided in RCW 90.14.041, 90.14.043, or 90.14.068 and in RCW 90.14.051 and 90.14.061, shall be conclusively deemed to have waived and relinquished any right, title, or interest in said right.

## 90.14.081 - Filing of claim not deemed adjudication of right—Prima facie evidence.
The filing of a statement of claim does not constitute an adjudication of any claim to the right to use of waters as between the water use claimant and the state, or as between one or more water use claimants and another or others. A statement of claim filed pursuant to RCW 90.14.061 shall be admissible in a general adjudication of water rights as prima facie evidence of the times of use and the quantity of water the claimant was withdrawing or diverting as of the year of the filing, if, but only if, the quantities of water in use and the time of use when a controversy is mooted are substantially in accord with the times of use and quantity of water claimed in the statement of claim. A statement of claim shall not otherwise be evidence of the priority of the claimed water right.

## 90.14.140 - "Sufficient cause" for nonuse defined—Rights exempted.
1. For the purposes of RCW 90.14.130 through 90.14.180, "sufficient cause" shall be defined as the nonuse of all or a portion of the water by the owner of a water right for a period of five or more consecutive years where such nonuse occurs as a result of:

   a. Drought, or other unavailability of water;

   b. Active service in the armed forces of the United States during military crisis;

   c. Nonvoluntary service in the armed forces of the United States;

   d. The operation of legal proceedings;

   e. Federal or state agency leases of or options to purchase lands or water rights which preclude or reduce the use of the right by the owner of the water right;

   f. Federal laws imposing land or water use restrictions either directly or through the voluntary enrollment of a landowner in a federal program implementing those laws, or acreage limitations, or production quotas;

   g. Temporarily reduced water need for irrigation use where such reduction is due to varying weather conditions, including but not limited to precipitation and temperature, that warranted the reduction in water use, so long as the water user's diversion and delivery facilities are maintained in good operating condition consistent with beneficial use of the full amount of the water right;

   h. Temporarily reduced diversions or withdrawals of irrigation water directly resulting from the provisions of a contract or similar agreement in which a supplier of electricity buys back electricity from the water right holder and the electricity is needed for the diversion or withdrawal or for the use of the water diverted or withdrawn for irrigation purposes;

   i. Water conservation measures implemented under the Yakima river basin water enhancement project, so long as the conserved water is reallocated in accordance with the provisions of P.L. 103-434;

   j. Reliance by an irrigation water user on the transitory presence of return flows in lieu of diversion or withdrawal of water from the primary source of supply, if such return flows are measured or reliably estimated using a scientific methodology generally accepted as reliable within the scientific community;

   k. The reduced use of irrigation water resulting from crop rotation. For purposes of this subsection, crop rotation means the temporary change in the type of crops grown resulting from the exercise of generally recognized sound farming practices. Unused water resulting from crop rotation will not be relinquished if the remaining portion of the water continues to be beneficially used; or

   l. Waiting for a final determination from the department of ecology on a change application filed under RCW 90.03.250, 90.03.380, or 90.44.100.

2. Notwithstanding any other provisions of RCW 90.14.130 through 90.14.180, there shall be no relinquishment of any water right:

   a. If such right is claimed for power development purposes under chapter 90.16 RCW and annual license fees are paid in accordance with chapter 90.16 RCW;

   b. If such right is used for a standby or reserve water supply to be used in time of drought or other low flow period so long as withdrawal or diversion facilities are maintained in good operating condition for the use of such reserve or standby water supply;

   c. If such right is claimed for a determined future development to take place either within fifteen years of July 1, 1967, or the most recent beneficial use of the water right, whichever date is later;

   d. If such right is claimed for municipal water supply purposes under chapter 90.03 RCW;

   e. If such waters are not subject to appropriation under the applicable provisions of RCW 90.40.030;

   f. If such right or portion of the right is leased to another person for use on land other than the land to which the right is appurtenant as long as the lessee makes beneficial use of the right in accordance with this chapter and a transfer or change of the right has been approved by the department in accordance with RCW 90.03.380, 90.03.383, 90.03.390, or 90.44.100;

   g. If such a right or portion of the right is authorized for a purpose that is satisfied by the use of agricultural industrial process water as authorized under RCW 90.46.150; or

   h. If such right is a trust water right under chapter 90.38 or 90.42 RCW.

3.
