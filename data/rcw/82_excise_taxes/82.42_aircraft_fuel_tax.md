## 82.42.010 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Air carrier" means any airline, air cargo carrier, air taxi, air commuter, or air charter operator, that provides routine air service to the general population for compensation or hire, and operates at least fifteen round trips per week between two or more points and publishes flight schedules which specify the times, days of the week, and points between which it operates. Where it is doubtful that an operation is for "compensation or hire," the test applied is whether the air service is merely incidental to the person's other business or is, in itself, a major enterprise for profit.

2. "Aircraft" means every contrivance now known or hereafter invented, used or designed for navigation of or flight in the air, operated or propelled by the use of aircraft fuel.

3. "Aircraft fuel" means gasoline and any other inflammable liquid, by whatever name such liquid is known or sold, the chief use of which is as fuel for the propulsion of aircraft, except gas or liquid, the chief use of which as determined by the director, is for purposes other than the propulsion of aircraft.

4. "Dealer" means any person engaged in the retail sale of aircraft fuel.

5. "Department" means the department of licensing.

6. "Director" means the director of licensing.

7. "Distributor" means any person engaged in the sale of aircraft fuel to any dealer and includes any dealer from whom the tax hereinafter imposed has not been collected.

8. "Local service commuter" means an air taxi operator who operates at least five round-trips per week between two or more points; publishes flight schedules which specify the times, days of the week, and points between which it operates; and whose aircraft has a maximum capacity of sixty passengers or eighteen thousand pounds of useful load.

9. "Person" means every natural person, firm, partnership, association, or private or public corporation.

The director may require such records to be kept, and for such periods of time, as deemed necessary for the administration of this chapter, which records shall be available at all times for the director or his or her representative who may require a statement under oath as to the contents thereof. During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the director, on his or her own motion or at the request of any taxpayer affected by the emergency, may extend the time for filing any report or the due date for tax remittances as the director deems proper.

1. Proof as the department may require concerning the applicant's identity, including but not limited to his or her fingerprints or those of the officers of a corporation making the application;

2. The applicant's form and place of organization including proof that the individual, partnership, or corporation is licensed to do business in this state;

3. The qualification and business history of the applicant and any partner, officer, or director;

4. The applicant's financial condition or history including a bank reference and whether the applicant or any partner, officer, or director has ever been adjudged bankrupt or has an unsatisfied judgment in a federal or state court;

5. Whether the applicant has been adjudged guilty of a crime that directly relates to the business for which the license is sought and the time elapsed since the conviction is less than ten years, or has suffered a judgment within the preceding five years in a civil action involving fraud, misrepresentation, or conversion and in the case of a corporation or partnership, all directors, officers, or partners.

After receipt of an application for a license, the director may conduct an investigation to determine whether the facts set forth are true. The director may require a fingerprint record check of the applicant through the Washington state patrol criminal identification system and the federal bureau of investigation before issuance of a license. The results of the background investigation including criminal history information may be released to authorized department personnel as the director deems necessary. The department shall charge a license holder or license applicant a fee of fifty dollars for each background investigation conducted.

An applicant who makes a false statement of a material fact on the application may be prosecuted for false swearing as defined by RCW 9A.72.040.

A person notified must, within twenty days after receipt of notice, advise the department of any credits, personal and real property, or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them, and must immediately deliver the credits, personal and real property, or debts to the department.

2. The notice and order to withhold and deliver constitutes a continuing lien on property of the person. The department must include in the notice to withhold and deliver "continuing lien." The effective date of a notice to withhold and deliver is the date of mailing.

3. If a person fails to timely answer the notice, a court may render a judgment, plus costs by default against the person.

Notice of sale and the time and place must be given to the person and to all persons appearing with an interest in the property. The notice must be in writing at least ten days before the date of sale. Notice must be published for at least ten days before the date of sale in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county the property will be sold.

2. The department must sell the property and deliver to the purchaser a bill of sale or deed. If the moneys received exceed the amount due from the person, the excess must be returned to the person and a receipt obtained. If any person having an interest in or lien upon the property has filed notice with the department prior to the sale, the department must withhold payment of any excess to the person pending determination of the rights of the respective parties by a court of competent jurisdiction. If the receipt of the person is not available, the department must deposit the excess with the state treasurer as trustee for the person or their heirs, successors, or assigns. Prior to making any seizure of property, the department may first serve upon the person's bondsperson a notice of delinquency and demand for payment of the amount due.

\[ [2013 c 225 § 408](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1883-S.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20225%20§%20408); \]

## 82.42.068 - Payment of tax by a nonlicensee.
Every person, other than a licensee, who acquires fuel upon which payment of tax is required, if the tax has not been paid, must comply with the provisions of this chapter, and pay tax at the rate provided in RCW 82.42.020. The person is subject to the same duties and penalties imposed upon licensees.

\[ [2013 c 225 § 412](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1883-S.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20225%20§%20412); \]

## 82.42.075 - Bonding requirements.
1. A license may not be issued or continued in force unless a bond is provided to secure payment of all taxes, interest, and penalties. This requirement may be waived for licensees properly bonded under the provisions of chapter 82.38 RCW or licensed aircraft fuel distributors who, upon determination by the department, have sufficient resources, assets, other financial instruments, or other means to adequately make payments on monthly aircraft fuel tax payments, penalties, and interest.

2. The department may require a licensee to post a bond if the department determines a bond is required to protect the interests of the state.

3. The total amount of the bond or bonds is three times the estimated monthly aircraft fuel tax liability. The total bonding amount may never be less than five thousand dollars nor more than one hundred thousand dollars.

4. In lieu of a bond, a licensee may deposit with the state treasurer, a like amount of money of the United States or bonds or other obligations of the United States, the state, or any county of the state, of a market value not less than the amount of the required bond.

5. The department may require a licensee to increase the bond amount or to deposit additional securities as described in this section if the security of the bond or the market value of the securities becomes impaired or inadequate.

6. Any surety on a bond furnished by a licensee must be released and discharged from any liability accruing on such bond after the expiration of forty-five days from the date the surety provided written notification to the department. This subsection does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from any liability accrued or which will accrue before the expiration of the forty-five day period. The department must promptly notify the licensee who furnished the bond, and unless the licensee, on or before the expiration of the forty-five day period, files a new bond the department must cancel the license.

4. If any licensee establishes by a fair preponderance of evidence that failure to file a report or pay the proper amount of tax within the time prescribed was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or willful, the department may waive the penalty prescribed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

5. If any licensee files a false or fraudulent report with intent to evade the tax imposed by this chapter, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the deficiency must be added to the amount of deficiency, which is in addition to all other penalties prescribed by law.

The department may continue the hearing as needed. The decision of the department upon a petition for reassessment becomes final thirty days after service upon the licensee.

11. Every assessment made by the department becomes due and payable at the time it becomes final and if not timely paid to the department a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax must be added to the assessment.

12. Any notice of assessment required by this section must be served by depositing such notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid addressed to the licensee at the address shown in the records of the department.
