## 82.24.030 - Stamps.
1. In order to enforce collection of the tax hereby levied, the department of revenue must design and have printed stamps of such size and denominations as may be determined by the department. The stamps must be affixed on the smallest container or package that will be handled, sold, used, consumed, or distributed, to permit the department to readily ascertain by inspection, whether or not such tax has been paid or whether an exemption from the tax applies.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, only a wholesaler may cause to be affixed on every package of cigarettes, stamps of an amount equaling the tax due thereon or stamps identifying the cigarettes as exempt before he or she sells, offers for sale, uses, consumes, handles, removes, or otherwise disturbs and distributes the same. However, where it is established to the satisfaction of the department that it is impractical to affix such stamps to the smallest container or package, the department may authorize the affixing of stamps of appropriate denomination to a large container or package.

3. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, only wholesalers may purchase or obtain cigarette stamps. Wholesalers may not sell or provide stamps to any other wholesaler or person.

4. Each roll of stamps, or group of sheets, must have a separate serial number, which is legible at the point of sale. The department of revenue must keep records of which wholesaler purchases each roll or group of sheets. If the department of revenue permits wholesalers to purchase partial rolls or sheets, in no case may stamps bearing the same serial number be sold to more than one wholesaler. The remainder of the roll or sheet, if any, must either be retained for later purchases by the same wholesaler or destroyed.

5. Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting any otherwise lawful activity under a cigarette tax compact pursuant to chapter 43.06 RCW.

6. In order to enforce collection of the tax in the case of roll-your-own cigarettes, a retailer must affix a stamp or stamps to each box or similar container provided by the retailer to the consumer. The box or similar container must be used by a consumer to transport roll-your-own cigarettes from the retailer's place of business. A retailer must provide cigarette tubes to a consumer in one or more twenty unit denominations. Stamps must be for an amount equaling the tax due under this chapter. Each cigarette tube or paper provided to the consumer is deemed a cigarette for purposes of imposing and collecting taxes under this chapter. Stamps for roll-your-own cigarettes must be issued and affixed in a manner determined by the department but as consistent as practicable with the stamping requirements for wholesalers.

## 82.24.035 - Circumstances when no stamp may be affixed—Violation of consumer protection act.
1. No stamp may be affixed to, or made upon, any container or package of cigarettes if:

   a. The container or package differs in any respect with the requirements of the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 et seq.) for the placement of labels, warnings, or any other information upon a package of cigarettes that is to be sold within the United States;

Such unstamped stock shall be kept separate and apart from stamped stock.

3.

## 82.24.050 - Retailer—Possession of unstamped cigarettes—Access to commercial cigarette-making machines.

2. A retailer may obtain cigarettes only from a wholesaler subject to the provisions of this chapter.

3. Only a retailer licensed under this chapter may provide consumers with access to a commercial cigarette-making machine to make roll-your-own cigarettes.

## 82.24.060 - Stamps—How affixed.

## 82.24.080 - Legislative intent—Taxable event—Tax liability.
1. It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to levy a tax on all of the articles taxed under this chapter, sold, used, consumed, handled, possessed, or distributed within this state and to collect the tax from the person who first sells, uses, consumes, handles, possesses (either physically or constructively, in accordance with RCW 82.24.020) or distributes them in the state. It is further the intent and purpose of this chapter that whenever any of the articles taxed under this chapter is given away for advertising or any other purpose, it shall be taxed in the same manner as if it were sold, used, consumed, handled, possessed, or distributed in this state.

2. It is also the intent and purpose of this chapter that the tax shall be imposed at the time and place of the first taxable event and upon the first taxable person within this state. Any person whose activities would otherwise require payment of the tax imposed by subsection (1) of this section but who is exempt from the tax nevertheless has a precollection obligation for the tax that must be imposed on the first taxable event within this state. A precollection obligation may not be imposed upon a person exempt from the tax who sells, distributes, or transfers possession of cigarettes to another person who, by law, is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter or upon whom the obligation for collection of the tax may not be imposed. Failure to pay the tax with respect to a taxable event shall not prevent tax liability from arising by reason of a subsequent taxable event.

3. In the event of an increase in the rate of the tax imposed under this chapter, it is the intent of the legislature that the first person who sells, uses, consumes, handles, possesses, or distributes previously taxed articles after the effective date of the rate increase shall be liable for the additional tax, or its precollection obligation as required by this chapter, represented by the rate increase. The failure to pay the additional tax with respect to the first taxable event after the effective date of a rate increase shall not prevent tax liability for the additional tax from arising from a subsequent taxable event.

4. It is the intent of the legislature that, in the absence of a cigarette tax contract or agreement under chapter 43.06 RCW, applicable taxes imposed by this chapter be collected on cigarettes sold by an Indian tribal organization to any person who is not an enrolled member of the federally recognized Indian tribe within whose jurisdiction the sale takes place consistent with collection of these taxes generally within the state. The legislature finds that applicable collection and enforcement measures under this chapter are reasonably necessary to prevent fraudulent transactions and place a minimal burden on the Indian tribal organization, pursuant to the United States supreme court's decision in Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134 (1980).

## 82.24.090 - Records—Preservation—Reports.
1. Every wholesaler or retailer subject to the provisions of this chapter shall keep and preserve for a period of five years an accurate set of records. These records must show all transactions relating to the purchase and sale of any of the articles taxed under this chapter and show all physical inventories performed on those articles, all invoices, and a record of all stamps purchased. All such records and all stock of taxable articles on hand shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by the department of revenue or its duly authorized agent.

2. All wholesalers shall within fifteen days after the first day of each month file with the department of revenue a report of all drop shipment sales made by them to retailers within this state during the preceding month.

## 82.24.135 - Forfeiture procedure.
In all cases of seizure of any property made subject to forfeiture under this chapter the department or the board shall proceed as follows:

1. Forfeiture shall be deemed to have commenced by the seizure. Notice of seizure shall be given to the department or the board immediately if the seizure is made by someone other than an agent of the department or the board authorized to collect taxes.

2. Upon notification or seizure by the department or the board or upon receipt of property subject to forfeiture under this chapter from any other person, the department or the board shall list and particularly describe the property seized in duplicate and have the property appraised by a qualified person not employed by the department or the board or acting as its agent. Listing and appraisement of the property shall be properly attested by the department or the board and the appraiser, who shall be allowed a reasonable appraisal fee. No appraisal is required if the property seized is judged by the department or the board to be less than one hundred dollars in value.

3. The department or the board shall cause notice to be served within five days following the seizure or notification to the department or the board of the seizure on the owner of the property seized, if known, on the person in charge thereof, and on any other person having any known right or interest therein, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. The notice may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including but not limited to service by mail. The department may also furnish notice electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.135. If service is by mail or notice is provided electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.135, the notice shall also be served by certified mail with return receipt requested. Electronic notification or service by mail shall be deemed complete upon mailing the notice, electronically sending the notice, or electronically notifying the person or persons entitled to the notice that the notice is available to be accessed by the person or persons, within the five-day period following the seizure or notification of the seizure to the department or the board.

4. If no person notifies the department or the board in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of the items seized within fifteen days of the date of the notice of seizure, the item seized shall be considered forfeited.

5. If any person notifies the department or the board, in writing, of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of the items seized within fifteen days of the date of the notice of seizure, the person or persons shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The hearing shall be before the director or the director's designee or the board or the board's designee, except that any person asserting a claim or right may bring an action for return of the seized items in the superior court of the county in which such property was seized, if the aggregate value of the article or articles involved is more than five hundred dollars. A hearing and any appeal therefrom shall be in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. The burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence shall be upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the items seized. The department or the board shall promptly return the article or articles to the claimant upon a determination that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession thereof of the items seized.

2. Sell the property at public auction to the highest bidder after due advertisement, but the department before delivering any of the goods so seized shall require the person to whom the property is sold to affix the proper amount of stamps.
