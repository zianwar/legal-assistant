## 82.18.030 - Collection of tax.
The person collecting the charges made for using the solid waste collection business shall collect the tax imposed in this chapter. If any person charged with collecting the tax fails to bill the taxpayer for the tax, or in the alternative has not notified the taxpayer in writing of the imposition of the tax, or having collected the tax, fails to pay it to the department in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of the person's own acts or the result of acts or conditions beyond the person's control, he or she shall, nevertheless, be personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax.

\[ [1989 c 431 § 84](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c431.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20431%20§%2084); [1986 c 282 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c282.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20282%20§%208); \]

## 82.18.040 - Collection of tax—Payment to state.
1. Taxes collected under this chapter must be held in trust until paid to the state. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (1), taxes received by the state must be deposited in the public works assistance account created in RCW 43.155.050. For the period beginning July 1, 2011, and ending June 30, 2015, taxes received by the state under this chapter must be deposited in the general fund for general purpose expenditures. For fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, one-half of the taxes received by the state under this chapter must be deposited in the general fund for general purpose expenditures and the remainder deposited in the education legacy trust account created in RCW 83.100.230. For fiscal years 2019 through 2023, taxes received by the state under this chapter must be deposited in the education legacy trust account created in RCW 83.100.230. Any person collecting the tax who appropriates or converts the tax collected is guilty of a gross misdemeanor if the money required to be collected is not available for payment on the date payment is due. If a taxpayer fails to pay the tax imposed by this chapter to the person charged with collection of the tax and the person charged with collection fails to pay the tax to the department, the department may, in its discretion, proceed directly against the taxpayer for collection of the tax.

2. The tax is due from the taxpayer within twenty-five days from the date the taxpayer is billed by the person collecting the tax.

3. The tax is due from the person collecting the tax at the end of the tax period in which the tax is received from the taxpayer. If the taxpayer remits only a portion of the total amount billed for taxes, consideration, and related charges, the amount remitted must be applied first to payment of the solid waste collection tax and this tax has priority over all other claims to the amount remitted.
