   a. Manufacturing operations;

   b. Facilities to produce clean fuels, subject to the limitations in subsection (8)(d) of this section, renewable hydrogen, green electrolytic hydrogen, or green hydrogen carriers; or

   c. Storage facilities.

3. "Green electrolytic hydrogen" means hydrogen produced through electrolysis and does not include hydrogen manufactured using steam reforming or any other conversion technology that produces hydrogen from a fossil fuel feedstock.

4. "Green hydrogen carrier" means a chemical compound, created using electricity or renewable resources as energy input and without use of fossil fuel as a feedstock, from renewable hydrogen or green electrolytic hydrogen for the purposes of transportation, storage, and dispensing of hydrogen.

5. [Empty]

   a. "Initiation of construction" means the date that a building permit is issued under the building code adopted under RCW  19.27.031 for:

      i. Construction of the qualified building, if the underlying ownership of the building vests exclusively with the person receiving the economic benefit of the deferral;

      ii. Construction of the qualified building, if the economic benefits of the deferral are passed to a lessee as provided in RCW 82.89.020; or

      iii. Tenant improvements for a qualified building, if the economic benefits of the deferral are passed to a lessee as provided in RCW 82.89.020.

   b. "Initiation of construction" does not include soil testing, site clearing and grading, site preparation, or any other related activities that are initiated before the issuance of a building permit for the construction of the foundation of the building.

   c. If the eligible investment project is a phased project, "initiation of construction" applies separately to each phase.

6. "Investment project" means an investment in either qualified buildings or qualified machinery and equipment, or both, including labor and services rendered in the planning, installation, and construction of the project.
