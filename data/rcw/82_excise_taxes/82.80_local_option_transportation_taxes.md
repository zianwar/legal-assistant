2. The local option transportation revenues shall be expended for transportation uses consistent with the adopted transportation and land use plans of the jurisdiction expending the funds and consistent with any applicable and adopted regional transportation plan for metropolitan planning areas.

3. Each local government with a population greater than eight thousand that levies or expends local option transportation funds, is also required to develop and adopt a specific transportation program that contains the following elements:

   a. The program shall identify the geographic boundaries of the entire area or areas within which local option transportation revenues will be levied and expended.

   d. The program shall include at least a six-year funding plan, updated annually, identifying the specific public and private sources and amounts of revenue necessary to fund the program. The program shall include a proposed schedule for construction of projects and expenditure of revenues. The funding plan shall consider the additional local tax revenue estimated to be generated by new development within the plan area if all or a portion of the additional revenue is proposed to be earmarked as future appropriations for transportation improvements in the program.

4. Local governments with a population greater than eight thousand exercising the authority for local option transportation funds shall periodically review and update their transportation program to ensure that it is consistent with applicable local and regional transportation and land use plans and within the means of estimated public and private revenue available.

   a. First, the project serves a multijurisdictional function;

   b. Second, it is necessitated by existing or reasonably foreseeable congestion;

   c. Third, it has the greatest person-carrying capacity;

   d. Fourth, it is partially funded by other government funds, such as from the state transportation improvement board, or by private sector contributions, such as those from the local transportation act, chapter 39.92 RCW; and

   e. Fifth, it meets such other criteria as the local government determines is appropriate.

## 82.80.120 - Motor vehicle and special fuel tax—Regional transportation investment district.
1. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Distributor" means every person who imports, refines, manufactures, produces, or compounds motor vehicle fuel and special fuel as defined in RCW 82.38.020 and sells or distributes the fuel into a county.

   b. "Person" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.030.

   c. "District" means a regional transportation investment district under chapter 36.120 RCW.

2. A regional transportation investment district under chapter 36.120 RCW, subject to the conditions of this section, may levy additional excise taxes equal to ten percent of the statewide fuel tax rates under RCW 82.38.030 on motor vehicle fuel and special fuel as defined in RCW 82.38.020 sold within the boundaries of the district. The additional excise tax is subject to the approval of a majority of the voters within the district boundaries. Vehicles paying an annual license fee under RCW 82.38.075 are exempt from the district's fuel excise tax. The additional excise taxes are subject to the same exceptions and rights of refund as applicable to other motor vehicle fuel and special fuel excise taxes levied under chapter 82.38 RCW. The proposed tax may not be levied less than one month from the date the election results are certified. The commencement date for the levy of any tax under this section will be the first day of January, April, July, or October.

3. The local option motor vehicle fuel tax on motor vehicle fuel and on special fuel is imposed upon the distributor of the fuel.

4. A taxable event for the purposes of this section occurs upon the first distribution of the fuel within the boundaries of the district to a retail outlet, bulk fuel user, or ultimate user of the fuel.

5. All administrative provisions in chapters 82.01, 82.03, and 82.32 RCW, insofar as they are applicable, apply to local option fuel taxes imposed under this section.

6. Before the effective date of the imposition of the fuel taxes under this section, a district must contract with the department of revenue for the administration and collection of the taxes. The contract must provide that a percentage amount, not to exceed one percent of the taxes imposed under this section, will be deposited into the local tax administration account created in the custody of the state treasurer. The department of revenue may spend money from this account, upon appropriation, for the administration of the local taxes imposed under this section.

7. The state treasurer must distribute monthly to the district levying the tax as part of the regional transportation investment district plan, after the deductions for payments and expenditures as provided in RCW 46.68.090(1) (a) and (b).

8. The proceeds of the additional taxes levied by a district in this section, to be used as a part of a regional transportation investment district plan, must be used in accordance with chapter 36.120 RCW, but only for those areas that are considered "highway purposes" as that term is construed in Article II, section 40 of the state Constitution.

9. A district may only levy the tax under this section if the district is comprised of boundaries identical to the boundaries of a county or counties. A district may not levy the tax in this section if a member county is levying the tax in RCW 82.80.010 or 82.80.110.

The tax must be collected only at the time of vehicle registration renewal under *chapter 46.16 RCW. The tax will be imposed on vehicles previously registered in another state or nation when they are initially registered in this state. The tax will not be imposed at the time of sale by a licensed vehicle dealer. In a county imposing a motor vehicle excise tax surcharge under RCW 81.100.060, the maximum tax rate under this section must be reduced to a rate equal to four-tenths of one percent on the value less the equivalent motor vehicle excise tax rate of the surcharge imposed under RCW 81.100.060. This rate does not apply to vehicles registered under RCW 46.16A.455 with a scale weight more than six thousand pounds, or to vehicles registered under RCW 46.16A.425, 46.17.335, or 46.17.350(1)(c).

2. The department of licensing shall administer and collect the tax in accordance with chapter 82.44 RCW. The department shall deduct a percentage amount, as provided by contract, not to exceed one percent of the taxes collected, for administration and collection expenses incurred by it. The remaining proceeds must be remitted to the custody of the state treasurer for monthly distribution to the public transportation benefit area.

3. The public transportation benefit area imposing this tax shall delay the effective date at least six months from the date the fee is approved by the qualified voters of the authority area to allow the department of licensing to implement administration and collection of the tax.

4. Before an authority may impose a tax authorized under this section, the authorization for imposition of the tax must be approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the authority area voting on that issue.
