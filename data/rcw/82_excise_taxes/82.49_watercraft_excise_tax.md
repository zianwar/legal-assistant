## 82.49.010 - Excise tax imposed—Failure to register—Out-of-state registration to avoid tax, liability—Penalties.
1. An excise tax is imposed for the privilege of using a vessel upon the waters of this state, except vessels exempt under RCW 82.49.020. The annual amount of the excise tax is one-half of one percent of fair market value, as determined under this chapter, or five dollars, whichever is greater. Violation of this subsection is a misdemeanor.

2. A person who is required under chapter 88.02 RCW to register a vessel in this state and who fails to register the vessel in this state or registers the vessel in another state or foreign country and avoids the Washington watercraft excise tax is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and is liable for such unpaid excise tax. The department of revenue may assess and collect the unpaid excise tax under chapter 82.32 RCW, including the penalty imposed in RCW 82.49.080 and penalties and interest provided in chapter 82.32 RCW.

3. The excise tax upon a vessel registered for the first time in this state shall be imposed for a twelve-month period, including the month in which the vessel is registered, unless the director of licensing extends or diminishes vessel registration periods for the purpose of staggered renewal periods under RCW 88.02.560. A vessel is registered for the first time in this state when the vessel was not registered in this state for the immediately preceding registration year, or when the vessel was registered in another jurisdiction for the immediately preceding year.
