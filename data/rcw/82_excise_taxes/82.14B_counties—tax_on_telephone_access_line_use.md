## 82.14B.010 - Findings.
The legislature finds that the state and counties should be provided with an additional revenue source to fund 911 emergency communications systems throughout the state on a multicounty or countywide basis. The legislature further finds that the most efficient and appropriate method of deriving additional revenue for this purpose is to impose an excise tax on the use of switched access lines, radio access lines, and interconnected voice over internet protocol service lines.

   a. The state and county 911 excise taxes imposed by this chapter must be paid by:

      i. The subscriber to the local exchange company providing the switched access line, the radio communications service company providing the radio access line, or the interconnected voice over internet protocol service company providing the interconnected voice over internet protocol service line; or

      ii. The consumer to the seller of prepaid wireless telecommunications service.

   b. Each local exchange company, each radio communications service company, and each interconnected voice over internet protocol service company must collect from the subscriber, and each seller of prepaid wireless telecommunications service must collect from the consumer, the full amount of the taxes payable. The state and county 911 excise taxes required by this chapter to be collected by a company or seller, are deemed to be held in trust by the company or seller until paid to the department. Any local exchange company, radio communications service company, seller of prepaid wireless telecommunications service, or interconnected voice over internet protocol service company that appropriates or converts the tax collected to its own use or to any use other than the payment of the tax to the extent that the money collected is not available for payment on the due date as prescribed in this chapter is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

2. If any local exchange company, radio communications service company, seller of prepaid wireless telecommunications service, or interconnected voice over internet protocol service company fails to collect the state or county 911 excise tax or, after collecting the tax, fails to pay it to the department in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of its own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond its control, the company or seller is personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax, unless the company or seller has taken from the buyer in good faith documentation, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, stating that the buyer is not a subscriber or consumer or is otherwise not liable for the state or county 911 excise tax.

3. The amount of tax, until paid by the subscriber to the local exchange company, the radio communications service company, the interconnected voice over internet protocol service company, or to the department, or until paid by the consumer to the seller of prepaid wireless telecommunications service, or to the department, constitutes a debt from the subscriber to the company, or from the consumer to the seller. Any company or seller that fails or refuses to collect the tax as required with intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or to gain some advantage or benefit, either direct or indirect, and any subscriber or consumer who refuses to pay any tax due under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor. The state and county 911 excise taxes required by this chapter to be collected by the local exchange company, radio communications service company, or interconnected voice over internet protocol service company must be stated separately on the billing statement that is sent to the subscriber.
