## 82.38.031 - Tax imposed—Intent.
It is the intent and purpose of this chapter that the tax shall be imposed at the time and place of the first taxable event and upon the first taxable person within this state. Any person whose activities would otherwise require payment of the tax imposed by RCW 82.38.030 but who is exempt from the tax nevertheless has a precollection obligation for the tax that must be imposed on the first taxable event within this state. Failure to pay the tax with respect to a taxable event shall not prevent tax liability from arising by reason of a subsequent taxable event.

## 82.38.032 - Payment of tax by international fuel tax agreement licensees or persons operating under other reciprocity agreements.
International fuel tax agreement licensees, or persons operating motor vehicles under other reciprocity agreements entered into with the state of Washington, are liable for and must pay the tax under RCW 82.38.030 to the department on fuel used to operate motor vehicles on the highways of this state. This provision does not apply if the tax under RCW 82.38.030 has previously been imposed and paid by the international fuel tax agreement licensee or if the use of such fuel is exempt from the tax under this chapter.

## 82.38.033 - Payment of tax by a nonlicensee.
Every person, other than a licensee, who acquires fuel upon which payment of tax is required must, if the tax has not been paid, comply with the provisions of this chapter, and pay tax at the rate provided in RCW 82.38.030. The person is subject to the same duties and penalties imposed upon licensees.

## 82.38.060 - Tax computation on mileage basis (as amended by 2013 c 23).
In the event the tax on special fuel imported into this state in the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles for taxable use on Washington highways can be more accurately determined on a mileage basis, the department is authorized to approve and adopt such basis. When a special fuel user imports special fuel into or exports special fuel from the state of Washington in the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, the amount of special fuel consumed in such vehicles on Washington highways shall be deemed to be such proportion of the total amount of such special fuel consumed in his or her entire operations within and without this state as the total number of miles traveled on the public highways within this state bears to the total number of miles traveled within and without the state. The department may also adopt such mileage basis for determining the taxable use of special fuel used in motor vehicles which travel regularly over prescribed courses on and off the highways within the state of Washington. In the absence of records showing the number of miles actually operated per gallon of special fuel consumed, fuel consumption shall be calculated at the rate of one gallon for every: (1) Four miles traveled by vehicles over forty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight; (2) seven miles traveled by vehicles twelve thousand one to forty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight; (3) ten miles traveled by vehicles six thousand one to twelve thousand pounds gross vehicle weight; and (4) sixteen miles traveled by vehicles six thousand pounds or less gross vehicle weight.

2. To determine the annual license fee for a registration year, the appropriate dollar amount in the schedule is multiplied by the fuel tax rate per gallon effective on July 1st of the preceding calendar year and the product is divided by 12 cents.

3. The department, in addition to the resulting fee, must charge an additional fee of five dollars as a handling charge for each license issued.

4. The vehicle tonnage fee must be prorated so the annual license will correspond with the staggered vehicle licensing system.

5. A decal or other identifying device issued upon payment of the annual fee must be displayed as prescribed by the department as authority to purchase this fuel.

6. Persons selling or dispensing natural gas or propane may not sell or dispense this fuel for their own use or the use of others into tanks of vehicles powered by this fuel which do not display a valid decal or other identifying device.

7. Commercial motor vehicles registered in a foreign jurisdiction under the provisions of the international registration plan are subject to the annual fee.

8. Motor vehicles registered in a foreign jurisdiction, except those registered under the international registration plan under chapter 46.87 RCW, are exempt from this section.

   b. Fuel exported for use outside of this state. Fuel carried from this state in the fuel tank of a motor vehicle is deemed to be exported from this state. Fuel distributed to a federally recognized Indian tribal reservation located within the state of Washington is not considered exported outside this state.

   c. Tax, penalty, or interest erroneously or illegally collected or paid.

   d. Fuel which is lost or destroyed, while the licensee is the owner thereof, through fire, lightning, flood, windstorm, or explosion.

   e. Fuel of five hundred gallons or more which is lost or destroyed while the licensee is the owner thereof, through leakage or other casualty except evaporation, shrinkage, or unknown causes.

   f. Fuel used in power pumping units or other power take-off equipment of any motor vehicle which is accurately measured by metering devices that have been specifically approved by the department or by a formula determined by the department.

   a. Special fuel used for the operation of a motor vehicle as a part of or incidental to logging operations upon a highway under federal jurisdiction within the boundaries of a federal area if the federal government requires a fee for the privilege of operating the motor vehicle upon the highway, the proceeds of which are reserved for constructing or maintaining roads in the federal area, or requires maintenance or construction work to be performed on the highway for the privilege of operating the motor vehicle on the highway;

   b. Special fuel used by special mobile equipment as defined in RCW 46.04.552;

   c. Special fuel used in a motor vehicle for movement between two pieces of private property wherein the movement is incidental to the primary use of the vehicle; and

No refunds are authorized for fuel used on any trip where any portion of the trip is more than fifteen road miles beyond the corporate limits of the city in which the trip originated.

4. Recovery for such loss or destruction under subsections (1)(d) or (e) or (2)(d) of this section must be susceptible to positive proof thereby enabling the department to conduct such investigation and require such information as it may deem necessary. In the event that the department is not satisfied that the fuel was lost, destroyed, or contaminated as claimed because information or proof as required hereunder is not sufficient to substantiate the accuracy of the claim, it may deem such as sufficient cause to deny all right relating to the refund or credit for the excise tax paid on fuel alleged to be lost or destroyed.

5. No refund or claim for credit may be approved by the department unless the gallons of fuel claimed as nontaxable satisfy the conditions specifically set forth in this section and the nontaxable event or use occurred during the period covered by the refund claim. Refunds or claims for credit are not be [are not] allowed for anticipated nontaxable use or events.

3. The state patrol must list and particularly describe in duplicate the fuel seized. The selling price of the fuel seized must be the average terminal rack price for similar fuel, at the closest terminal rack on the day of sale, unless circumstance warrants that a different selling price is appropriate. The method used to value the fuel must be documented. The fuel must be sold at the earliest point in time, and the total price must include all appropriate state and federal taxes.

If service is by mail it must be by both certified mail with return receipt requested and regular mail. Service by mail is deemed complete upon mailing within the five-day period after the date of seizure.

The hearing must be before the director of licensing, or the director's designee. A hearing and any appeals must be in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. The burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence is upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the items seized. The state patrol and the department must promptly return the conveyance seized, and money from the sale of fuel seized, to the claimant upon a determination that the claimant is the present lawful owner and is lawfully entitled to possession of the items seized.
