   b. Be used for ride sharing;

   c. Be operated either within:

      i. The state's eight largest counties that are required to develop commute trip reduction plans as directed by chapter 70A.15 RCW;

2. The reissuance of a certificate of title and registration certificate for a truck or trailer because of the installation of body or special equipment shall be treated as a sale, and the value of the truck or trailer at that time, as determined by the department from such information as may be available, shall be considered the latest purchase price.

3. For the purpose of determining any locally imposed motor vehicle excise tax, the value of a vehicle other than a truck or trailer shall be eighty-five percent of the manufacturer's base suggested retail price of the vehicle when first offered for sale as a new vehicle, excluding any optional equipment, applicable federal excise taxes, state and local sales or use taxes, transportation or shipping costs, or preparatory or delivery costs, multiplied by the applicable percentage listed in this subsection (3) based on year of service of the vehicle.

If the manufacturer's base suggested retail price is unavailable or otherwise unascertainable at the time of initial registration in this state, the department shall determine a value equivalent to a manufacturer's base suggested retail price as follows:

   a. The department shall determine a value using any information that may be available, including any guidebook, report, or compendium of recognized standing in the automotive industry or the selling price and year of sale of the vehicle. The department may use an appraisal by the county assessor. In valuing a vehicle for which the current value or selling price is not indicative of the value of similar vehicles of the same year and model, the department shall establish a value that more closely represents the average value of similar vehicles of the same year and model. The value determined in this subsection (3)(a) shall be divided by the applicable percentage listed in (b) of this subsection (3) to establish a value equivalent to a manufacturer's base suggested retail price and this value shall be multiplied by eighty-five percent.

   b. The year the vehicle is offered for sale as a new vehicle shall be considered the first year of service.

For vehicles registered under chapter 46.87 RCW, proportional registration, and for vehicle dealer plates issued under chapter 46.70 RCW, the registration year is the period provided in those chapters. However, the tax shall in no case be less than two dollars except for proportionally registered vehicles.

2. A vehicle is deemed registered for the first time in this state when the vehicle was not previously registered by this state for the registration year immediately preceding the registration year in which the application for registration is made or when the vehicle has been registered in another jurisdiction subsequent to any prior registration in this state.

3. An additional tax may not be imposed under this chapter on any vehicle when the certificate of title is being transferred if the tax has already been paid for the registration year or fraction of a registration year in which transfer of ownership occurs.

## 82.44.195 - Transportation infrastructure account—Highway infrastructure account—Finding—Intent—Purpose—1996 c 262.
The legislature finds that new financing mechanisms are necessary to provide greater flexibility and additional funds for needed transportation infrastructure projects in the state. The creation of a financing mechanism, like the one contained in section 350 of the national highway system designation act of 1995, P.L. 104-59, relating to a state infrastructure bank program, will enable the state and local jurisdictions to use federal, state, local, or private funds to construct surface transportation projects for various modes of transportation. It is the intent of the legislature that accounts be created in the state treasury and dedicated funding sources be established to generate revenue to support transportation projects financed with the proceeds of bonds or other financial instruments issued against this dedicated revenue and other revenues which may be available to these accounts. P.L. 104-59 allows the deposit of certain federal highway and transit funds into these accounts to leverage other forms of investment in transportation infrastructure by expanding the eligible uses of the federal funds. Other public and private entities may also deposit funds into these accounts to leverage transportation investments. The purpose of chapter 262, Laws of 1996 is to provide, from these accounts, authorization for loans, grants, or other means of assistance, in amounts equal to all or part of the cost, to public or private entities building surface transportation facilities in this state. It is the further intent of the legislature that projects representing critical mobility or economic development needs and involving various transportation modes and jurisdictions receive top priority in the use of these funds. Funds from the accounts created in chapter 262, Laws of 1996 may be used to support the issuance of public or private debt, to provide credit enhancement for such debt, for direct loans to public or private entities, or for other purposes necessary to facilitate investment in surface transportation facilities in this state.

## 82.44.200 - Electric vehicle account.

Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. During the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to make transfers of moneys in the electric vehicle account to the move ahead WA flexible account.
