1. Whereas access to food is a basic human need of every Washingtonian; and

2. Whereas keeping the price of groceries as low as possible improves the access to food for all Washingtonians; and

3. Whereas taxing groceries is regressive and hurts low- and fixed-income Washingtonians the most; and

4. Whereas working families in Washington pay a greater share of their family income in state and local taxes than their wealthier counterparts; now, therefore,

5. The people of the state of Washington find and declare that no local governmental entity may impose any new tax, fee, or other assessment that targets grocery items.
