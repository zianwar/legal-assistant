## 82.87.010 - Findings—Intent—2021 c 196.
The legislature finds that it is the paramount duty of the state to amply provide every child in the state with an education, creating the opportunity for the child to succeed in school and thrive in life. The legislature further finds that high quality early learning and child care is critical to a child's success in school and life, as it supports the development of the child's social-emotional, physical, cognitive, and language skills. Therefore, the legislature will invest in the ongoing support of K-12 education and early learning and child care by dedicating revenues from chapter 196, Laws of 2021 to the education legacy trust account and the common school construction account [fund].

The legislature further recognizes that a tax system that is fair, balanced, and works for everyone is essential to help all Washingtonians grow and thrive. But Washington's tax system today is the most regressive in the nation because it asks those making the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. Middle-income families in Washington pay two to four times more in taxes, as a percentage of household income, as compared to top earners in the state. Low-income Washingtonians pay at least six times more than do our wealthiest residents.

To help meet the state's paramount duty, the legislature intends to levy a seven percent tax on the voluntary sale or exchange of stocks, bonds, and other capital assets where the profit is in excess of $250,000 annually to fund K-12 education, early learning, and child care, and advance our paramount duty to amply provide an education to every child in the state. The legislature recognizes that levying this tax will have the additional effect of making material progress toward rebalancing the state's tax code.

The legislature further intends to exempt certain assets from the tax including, but not limited to, qualified family-owned small businesses, all residential and other real property, and retirement accounts.

4. [Empty]

   a. The tax imposed in this section applies to the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets owned by the taxpayer, whether the taxpayer was the legal or beneficial owner of such assets at the time of the sale or exchange. The tax applies when the Washington capital gains are recognized by the taxpayer in accordance with this chapter.

      i. An individual is considered to be a beneficial owner of long-term capital assets held by an entity that is a pass-through or disregarded entity for federal tax purposes, such as a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation, or grantor trust, to the extent of the individual's ownership interest in the entity as reported for federal income tax purposes.

      ii.

A grantor of such trust is considered the beneficial owner of the capital assets of the trust for purposes of the tax imposed in this section and must include any long-term capital gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset by the trust in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain, if such gain or loss is allocated to this state under RCW 82.87.100.

2. [Empty]

   a. An interest in a privately held entity only to the extent that any long-term capital gain or loss from such sale or exchange is directly attributable to the real estate owned directly by such entity.

   b. [Empty]

      i. Except as provided in (b)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, the value of the exemption under this subsection is equal to the fair market value of the real estate owned directly by the entity less its basis, at the time that the sale or exchange of the individual's interest occurs, multiplied by the percentage of the ownership interest in the entity which is sold or exchanged by the individual.

      ii. If a sale or exchange of an interest in an entity results in an amount directly attributable to real property and that is considered as an amount realized from the sale or exchange of property other than a capital asset under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 751 of the internal revenue code, such amount must not be considered in the calculation of an individual's exemption amount under (b)(i) of this subsection (2).

      iii. Real estate not owned directly by the entity in which an individual is selling or exchanging the individual's interest must not be considered in the calculation of an individual's exemption amount under (b)(i) of this subsection (2).

   c. Fair market value of real estate may be established by a fair market appraisal of the real estate or an allocation of assets by the seller and the buyer made under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1060 of the internal revenue code, as amended. However, the department is not bound by the parties' agreement as to the allocation of assets, allocation of consideration, or fair market value, if such allocations or fair market value do not reflect the fair market value of the real estate. The assessed value of the real estate for property tax purposes may be used to determine the fair market value of the real estate, if the assessed value is current as of the date of the sale or exchange of the ownership interest in the entity owning the real estate and the department determines that this method is reasonable under the circumstances.
