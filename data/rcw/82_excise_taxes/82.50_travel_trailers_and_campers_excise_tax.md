## 82.50.425 - Valuation of travel trailers and campers.
For the purpose of determining the tax under this chapter, the value of a travel trailer or camper is the manufacturer's base suggested retail price of the travel trailer or camper when first offered for sale as new, excluding any optional equipment, applicable federal excise taxes, state and local sales or use taxes, transportation or shipping costs, or preparatory or delivery costs, multiplied by the applicable percentage listed in this section based on the year of service.

If the manufacturer's base suggested retail price is unavailable or otherwise unascertainable at the time of initial registration in this state, the department shall determine a value equivalent to a manufacturer's base suggested retail price as follows:

1. The department shall determine a value using any information that may be available, including any guidebook, report, or compendium of recognized standing in the automotive industry or the selling price and year of sale of the travel trailer or camper. The department may use an appraisal by the county assessor. In valuing a travel trailer or camper for which the current value or selling price is not indicative of the value of similar travel trailers or campers of the same year and model, the department shall establish a value that more closely represents the average value of similar travel trailers or campers of the same year and model. If the travel trailer or camper is home-built, the value shall not be less than the cost of construction.

2. The value determined in subsection (1) of this section shall be divided by the applicable percentage listed in this section to establish a value equivalent to a manufacturer's base suggested retail price. The applicable percentage shall be based on the year of service of the travel trailer or camper for which the value is determined.
