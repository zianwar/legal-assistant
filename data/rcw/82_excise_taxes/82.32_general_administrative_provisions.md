## 82.32.020 - Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter:

1. The meaning attributed in chapters 82.01 through 82.27 RCW to the words and phrases "tax year," "taxable year," "person," "company," "gross proceeds of sales," "gross income of the business," "business," "engaging in business," "successor," "gross operating revenue," "gross income," "taxpayer," "retail sale," "seller," "buyer," "purchaser," "extended warranty," and "value of products" apply equally to the provisions of this chapter.

2. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the term "tax" includes any monetary exaction, regardless of its label, that the department is responsible for collecting, but not including interest, penalties, the surcharge imposed in RCW 40.14.027, or fees incurred by the department and recouped from taxpayers.

3. Whenever "property" or "personal property" is used, those terms must be construed to include digital goods and digital codes unless: (a) It is clear from the context that the term "personal property" is intended only to refer to tangible personal property; (b) it is clear from the context that the term "property" is intended only to refer to tangible personal property, real property, or both; or (c) to construe the term "property" or "personal property" as including digital goods and digital codes would yield unlikely, absurd, or strained consequences.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Agreement" means the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.

   b. "Associate member" means a petitioning state that is found to be in compliance with the agreement and changes to its laws, rules, or other authorities necessary to bring it into compliance are not in effect, but are scheduled to take effect on or before January 1, 2008. The petitioning states, by majority vote, may also grant associate member status to a petitioning state that does not receive an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the petitioning states upon a finding that the state has achieved substantial compliance with the terms of the agreement as a whole, but not necessarily each required provision, measured qualitatively, and there is a reasonable expectation that the state will achieve compliance by January 1, 2008.

   c. "Certified automated system" means software certified under the agreement to calculate the tax imposed by each jurisdiction on a transaction, determine the amount of tax to remit to the appropriate state, and maintain a record of the transaction.

   d. "Certified service provider" means an agent certified under the agreement to perform all of the seller's sales and use tax functions, other than the seller's obligation to remit tax on its own purchases.

   e. [Empty]

      i. "Member state" means a state that:

         A.  Has petitioned for membership in the agreement and submitted a certificate of compliance; and

         B.  Before the effective date of the agreement, has been found to be in compliance with the requirements of the agreement by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the other petitioning states; or

         C.  After the effective date of the agreement, has been found to be in compliance with the agreement by a three-fourths vote of the entire governing board of the agreement.

      ii. Membership by reason of (e)(i)(A) and (B) of this subsection is effective on the first day of a calendar quarter at least sixty days after at least ten states comprising at least twenty percent of the total population, as determined by the 2000 federal census, of all states imposing a state sales tax have petitioned for membership and have either been found in compliance with the agreement or have been found to be an associate member under section 704 of the agreement.

      iii. Membership by reason of (e)(i)(A) and (C) of this subsection is effective on the state's proposed date of entry or the first day of the calendar quarter after its petition is approved by the governing board, whichever is later, and is at least sixty days after its petition is approved.

   f. "Model 1 seller" means a seller that has selected a certified service provider as its agent to perform all the seller's sales and use tax functions as outlined in the contract between the streamlined sales tax governing board and the certified service provider, other than the seller's obligation to remit tax on its own purchases.

   g. "Model 2 seller" means a seller that has selected a certified automated system to perform part of its sales and use tax functions, but retains responsibility for remitting the tax.

   h.

## 82.32.030 - Registration certificates—Threshold levels—Central registration system.
1. Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if any person engages in any business or performs any act upon which a tax is imposed by the preceding chapters, he or she must, under such rules as the department prescribes, apply for and obtain from the department a registration certificate. Such registration certificate is personal and nontransferable and is valid as long as the taxpayer continues in business and pays the tax accrued to the state. In case business is transacted at two or more separate places by one taxpayer, a separate registration certificate for each place at which business is transacted with the public is required. Each certificate must be numbered and must show the name, residence, and place and character of business of the taxpayer and such other information as the department of revenue deems necessary and must be posted in a conspicuous place at the place of business for which it is issued. Where a place of business of the taxpayer is changed, the taxpayer must return to the department the existing certificate, and a new certificate will be issued for the new place of business. No person required to be registered under this section may engage in any business taxable hereunder without first being so registered. The department, by rule, may provide for the issuance of certificates of registration to temporary places of business.

2. Unless the person is a dealer as defined in RCW 9.41.010, registration under this section is not required if the following conditions are met:

   a. A person's value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business, from all business activities taxable under chapter 82.04 RCW, is less than twelve thousand dollars per year;

   b. The person's gross income of the business from all activities taxable under chapter 82.16 RCW is less than twelve thousand dollars per year;

   c. The person is not required to collect or pay to the department of revenue any other tax or fee that the department is authorized to collect; and

   d. The person is not otherwise required to obtain a license subject to the business license application procedure provided in chapter 19.02 RCW.

3. All persons who agree to collect and remit sales and use tax to the department under the agreement must register through the central registration system authorized under the agreement. Persons required to register under subsection (1) of this section are not relieved of that requirement because of registration under this subsection (3).

4. Persons registered under subsection (3) of this section who are not required to register under subsection (1) of this section and who are not otherwise subject to the requirements of chapter 19.02 RCW are not subject to the fees imposed by the department under the authority of RCW 19.02.075.

For tax liabilities arising before January 1, 1992, interest shall be computed at the rate of nine percent per annum from the last day of the year in which the deficiency is incurred until the earlier of December 31, 1998, or the date of payment. After December 31, 1998, the rate of interest shall be variable and computed as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The rate so computed shall be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

   b. For tax liabilities arising after December 31, 1991, the rate of interest shall be variable and computed as provided in subsection (2) of this section from the last day of the year in which the deficiency is incurred until the date of payment.

      ii. For interest associated with annual tax reporting periods having a due date as prescribed in RCW 82.32.045(3), interest must be computed from the last day of April immediately following each such annual reporting period included in the notice, until the due date of the notice.

      iii. If payment in full is not made by the due date of the notice, additional interest shall be computed under this subsection (1)(c) until the date of payment. The rate of interest shall be variable and computed as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The rate so computed shall be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

2. For the purposes of this section, the rate of interest to be charged to the taxpayer shall be an average of the federal short-term rate as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1274(d) plus two percentage points. The rate set for each new year shall be computed by taking an arithmetical average to the nearest percentage point of the federal short-term rate, compounded annually. That average shall be calculated using the rates from four months: January, April, and July of the calendar year immediately preceding the new year, and October of the previous preceding year.

3. During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the department, on its own motion or at the request of any taxpayer affected by the emergency, may extend the due date of any assessment or correction of an assessment for additional taxes, penalties, or interest as the department deems proper.

Supp. 1949 § 8370-188; \]

## 82.32.052 - Interest and penalties—Waiver for amounts unpaid as of February 1, 2011.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the department must waive all penalties and interest otherwise due under this chapter and that are unpaid as of February 1, 2011, if all of the following circumstances are met:

   a. The penalties and interest are imposed with respect to: (i) State business and occupation tax, state public utility tax, state or local sales tax, or state or local use tax; and (ii) tax liability that first became due to the department before February 1, 2011, which includes taxes billed to the taxpayer, or disclosed by the taxpayer to the department, on or after February 1, 2011, but that were required by this chapter to have been reported and paid by the taxpayer before February 1, 2011;

   b. The taxpayer must file with the department no later than April 18, 2011: (i) All outstanding tax returns for the taxes specified in (a)(i) of this subsection (1); and (ii) any amended returns covering tax liabilities with respect to which a penalty and interest waiver under this section is requested;

   c. Before May 1, 2011, the taxpayer must remit full payment to the department of the balance due on all tax liabilities for which a penalty and interest waiver under this section is requested. If a waiver is requested for penalties or interest associated with an invoice that has been billed to the taxpayer, the taxpayer must remit full payment to the department of the entire balance due on that invoice other than any penalty and interest eligible for waiver under this section, even if the invoice includes taxes not specified in (a)(i) of this subsection (1). If the invoice is a tax warrant, the taxpayer must also remit full payment to the department of any filing or other fees added to the tax warrant, including the filing fees provided in RCW 36.18.012 (2) and (10), the fee imposed in RCW 36.18.016(4), and the surcharge imposed in RCW 40.14.027;

   d. The taxpayer must file and pay in full by the due date all tax returns that become due after January 31, 2011, and before May 1, 2011, for all taxes administered by the department under this chapter;

   e. No later than April 18, 2011, the department must receive a completed application for penalty and interest waiver under this section in a form and manner prescribed by the department;

   f. The taxpayer must never have had an evasion penalty assessed against the taxpayer by the department under RCW 82.32.090 or a penalty assessed against the taxpayer by the department under RCW 82.32.291 for misusing a reseller permit or resale certificate; and

   g. The taxpayer must never have been a defendant in a criminal prosecution related to an offense involving the failure to collect or pay the proper amount of any tax administered by the department under this chapter.

2. Taxpayers receiving penalty or interest relief under this section may not seek a refund, or otherwise challenge the amount, of any tax liability paid as required by subsection (1)(c) of this section. This subsection (2) applies to refund requests or appeals filed directly with the department and to proceedings brought in any court or administrative tribunal.

3. All tax liability reported and paid as required in subsection (1)(b), (c), and (d) of this section is subject to verification by the department as provided in RCW 82.32.050. This section does not preclude the assessment of taxes, penalties, and interest with respect to any amounts determined by the department to have been underpaid for any tax period for which the taxpayer previously received penalty or interest relief under this section.

4. This section does not authorize the department to waive the evasion penalty currently authorized by RCW 82.32.090(7) or the penalty currently authorized by RCW 82.32.291 for misusing a reseller permit or resale certificate.

5. If taxpayers are current for tax returns due as of November 25, 2010, tax liability that accrues after that date would not qualify under this section.

6. Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a taxpayer to have first paid any penalty or interest for which a waiver is sought under this section.

7. Solely for purposes of determining whether a taxpayer qualifies for a waiver of penalties or interest under this section with respect to a balance owing as of February 1, 2011, on any invoice issued by the department, any payments made to the department on that taxpayer's account before May 1, 2011, are deemed to have been applied first to any of the taxes specified in subsection (1)(a)(i) of this section, then to any other taxes, and then to penalties or interest, if such payments were applied either:

   a. To that invoice; or

   b. Against any liability reflected in that invoice before that invoice was issued by the department.

8. A taxpayer in a bankruptcy proceeding is ineligible for relief under this section to the extent that the payment of any tax debt by the taxpayer to the department as required under this section violates the federal bankruptcy code.

## 82.32.055 - Interest and penalties—Waiver for military personnel.
1. Subject to the requirements in subsections (2) through (4) of this section, the department shall waive or cancel interest and penalties imposed under this chapter if the interest and penalties are:

   a. Imposed during any period of armed conflict; and

   b. Imposed on a taxpayer where a majority owner of the taxpayer is an individual who is on active duty in the military, and the individual is participating in a conflict and assigned to a duty station outside the territorial boundaries of the United States.

2. To receive a waiver or cancellation of interest and penalties under this section, the taxpayer must submit to the department a copy of the individual's deployment orders for deployment outside the territorial boundaries of the United States.

3. The department may not waive or cancel interest and penalties under this section if the gross income of the business exceeded one million dollars in the calendar year prior to the individual's initial deployment outside the United States for the armed conflict. The department may not waive or cancel interest and penalties under this section for a taxpayer for more than twenty-four months.

4. During any period of armed conflict, for any notice sent to a taxpayer that requires a payment of interest, penalties, or both, the notice must clearly indicate on or in the notice that interest and penalties may be waived under this section for qualifying taxpayers.

## 82.32.057 - Application of interest to delinquent taxes—Extensions. (Effective January 1, 2023.)
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, interest applies to taxes that are not paid by the original due date even though the department has granted an extension as authorized under this chapter. However, the department may not assess penalties for late payment of any such tax that is paid in full by the extended due date.

\[ [2022 c 282 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2099-S.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%20282%20§%201); \]

## 82.32.060 - Excess payment of tax, penalty, or interest—Credit or refund—Payment of judgments for refund.
1. If, upon receipt of an application by a taxpayer for a refund or for an audit of the taxpayer's records, or upon an examination of the returns or records of any taxpayer, it is determined by the department that within the statutory period for assessment of taxes, penalties, or interest prescribed by RCW 82.32.050 any amount of tax, penalty, or interest has been paid in excess of that properly due, the excess amount paid within, or attributable to, such period must be credited to the taxpayer's account or must be refunded to the taxpayer, at the taxpayer's option. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no refund or credit may be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

2. [Empty]

   a. The execution of a written waiver under RCW 82.32.050 or 82.32.100 will extend the time for making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the department discovers a refund or credit is due.

   b. A refund or credit must be allowed for an excess payment resulting from the failure to claim a bad debt deduction, credit, or refund under RCW 82.04.4284, 82.08.037, 82.12.037, 82.14B.150, or 82.16.050(5) for debts that became bad debts under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 166, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003, less than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

3. Any such refunds must be made by means of vouchers approved by the department and by the issuance of state warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the legislature may provide. However, taxpayers who are required to pay taxes by electronic funds transfer under RCW 82.32.080 must have any refunds paid by electronic funds transfer if the department has the necessary account information to facilitate a refund by electronic funds transfer.

4. Any judgment for which a recovery is granted by any court of competent jurisdiction, not appealed from, for tax, penalties, and interest which were paid by the taxpayer, and costs, in a suit by any taxpayer must be paid in the same manner, as provided in subsection (3) of this section, upon the filing with the department of a certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.

   a. Interest at the rate of three percent per annum must be allowed by the department and by any court on the amount of any refund, credit, or other recovery allowed to a taxpayer for taxes, penalties, or interest paid by the taxpayer before January 1, 1992. This rate of interest applies for all interest allowed through December 31, 1998. Interest allowed after December 31, 1998, must be computed at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(2). The rate so computed must be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

   b. For refunds or credits of amounts paid or other recovery allowed to a taxpayer after December 31, 1991, the rate of interest must be the rate as computed for assessments under RCW 82.32.050(2) less one percent. This rate of interest applies for all interest allowed through December 31, 1998. Interest allowed after December 31, 1998, must be computed at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(2). The rate so computed must be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

5. Interest allowed on a credit notice or refund issued after December 31, 2003, must be computed as follows:

   a. If all overpayments for each calendar year and all reporting periods ending with the final month included in a notice or refund were made on or before the due date of the final return for each calendar year or the final reporting period included in the notice or refund:

      i. Interest must be computed from January 31st following each calendar year included in a notice or refund;

      ii. Interest must be computed from the last day of the month following the final month included in a notice or refund; or

      iii. For interest associated with annual tax reporting periods having a due date as prescribed in RCW 82.32.045(3), interest must be computed from the last day of April following each such annual reporting period included in a notice or refund.

   b. If the taxpayer has not made all overpayments for each calendar year and all reporting periods ending with the final month included in a notice or refund on or before the dates specified by RCW 82.32.045 for the final return for each calendar year or the final month included in the notice or refund, interest must be computed from the last day of the month following the date on which payment in full of the liabilities was made for each calendar year included in a notice or refund, and the last day of the month following the date on which payment in full of the liabilities was made if the final month included in a notice or refund is not the end of a calendar year.

   c. Interest included in a credit notice must accrue up to the date the taxpayer could reasonably be expected to use the credit notice, as defined by the department's rules. If a credit notice is converted to a refund, interest must be recomputed to the date the refund is issued, but not to exceed the amount of interest that would have been allowed with the credit notice.

1. In addition to the procedure set forth in RCW 82.32.060 and as an exception to the four-year period explicitly set forth in RCW 82.32.060, an offset for a tax that has been paid in excess of that properly due may be taken under the following conditions:

   a. The tax paid in excess of that properly due was sales or use tax paid on property purchased for the purpose of leasing;

   b. The taxpayer was at the time of purchase entitled to purchase the property at wholesale under RCW 82.04.060; and

   c. The taxpayer substantiates that the taxpayer paid sales or use tax on the purchase of the property and that there was no intervening use of the property by the taxpayer.

2. The offset under this section is applied to and reduced by the amount of retail sales tax otherwise due from the beginning of lease of the property until the offset is extinguished.

## 82.32.070 - Records to be preserved—Examination—Estoppel to question assessment—Unified business identifier account number records.
1. Every taxpayer liable for any tax collected by the department must keep and preserve, for a period of five years, suitable records as may be necessary to determine the amount of any tax for which the taxpayer may be liable. Such records must include copies of all of the taxpayer's federal income tax and state tax returns and reports. All of the taxpayer's books, records, and invoices must be open for examination at any time by the department of revenue. In the case of an out-of-state taxpayer that does not keep the necessary books and records within this state, it is sufficient if the taxpayer produces within the state such books and records as are required by the department of revenue, or permits the examination by an agent authorized or designated by the department of revenue at the place where such books and records are kept. Any taxpayer who fails to comply with the requirements of this section is forever barred from questioning, in any court action or proceedings, the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the department of revenue based upon any period for which such books, records, and invoices have not been so kept and preserved.

2. A person liable for any fee or tax imposed by chapters 82.04 through 82.27 RCW who contracts with another person or entity for work subject to chapter 18.27 or 19.28 RCW must obtain and preserve a record of the unified business identifier account number for the person or entity performing the work. Failure to obtain or maintain the record is subject to RCW 39.06.010 and to a penalty determined by the director, but not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars. The department must notify the taxpayer and collect the penalty in the same manner as penalties under RCW 82.32.100.

1. When authorized by the department, payment of the tax may be made by uncertified check under such rules as the department prescribes, but, if a check so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such check is tendered, will remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties and interest, the same as if such check had not been tendered.

2. [Empty]

   a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, payment of the tax must be made by electronic funds transfer, as defined in RCW 82.32.085. As an alternative to electronic funds transfer, the department may authorize other forms of electronic payment, such as payment by credit card. All taxes administered by this chapter are subject to this requirement, except that the department may exclude any taxes not reported on the combined excise tax return or any successor return from the electronic payment requirement in this subsection.

   b. The department may waive the electronic payment requirement in this subsection for any taxpayer or class of taxpayers, for good cause or for whom the department has assigned a reporting frequency that is less than quarterly. In the discretion of the department, a waiver under this subsection may be made temporary or permanent, and may be made on the department's own motion.

   c. The department is authorized to accept payment of taxes by electronic funds transfer or other acceptable forms of electronic payment from taxpayers that are not subject to the mandatory electronic payment requirements in this subsection.

3. [Empty]

   a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, returns must be filed electronically using the department's online tax filing service or other method of electronic reporting as the department may authorize.

   b. The department may waive the electronic filing requirement in this subsection for any taxpayer or class of taxpayers, for good cause or for whom the department has assigned a reporting frequency that is less than quarterly. In the discretion of the department, a waiver under this subsection may be made temporary or permanent, and may be made on the department's own motion.

   c. The department is authorized to allow electronic filing of returns from taxpayers that are not subject to the mandatory electronic filing requirements in this subsection.

4. [Empty]

   a. [Empty]

      i. The department, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making and filing any return, and may grant such reasonable additional time within which to make and file returns as it may deem proper, but any permanent extension granting the taxpayer a reporting date without penalty more than ten days beyond the due date, and any extension in excess of thirty days must be conditional on deposit with the department of an amount to be determined by the department which is approximately equal to the estimated tax liability for the reporting period or periods for which the extension is granted. In the case of a permanent extension or a temporary extension of more than thirty days the deposit must be deposited within the state treasury with other tax funds and a credit recorded to the taxpayer's account which may be applied to taxpayer's liability upon cancellation of the permanent extension or upon reporting of the tax liability where an extension of more than thirty days has been granted.

      ii. The department must review the requirement for deposit at least annually and may require a change in the amount of the deposit required when it believes that such amount does not approximate the tax liability for the reporting period or periods for which the extension is granted.

   b. During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the department, on its own motion or at the request of any taxpayer affected by the emergency, may extend the time for making or filing any return as the department deems proper. The department may not require any deposit as a condition for granting an extension under this subsection (4)(b).

5. [Empty]

   a. The department must keep full and accurate records of all funds received and disbursed by it. Subject to the provisions of RCW 82.32.105, 82.32.052, and 82.32.350, the department must apply the payment of the taxpayer in the following order, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer: (i) Interest; (ii) penalties; (iii) fees that are not within the definition of tax in RCW 82.32.020; (iv) other nontax amounts; (v) taxes, except spirits taxes; and (vi) spirits taxes.

   b. For purposes of this subsection, "spirits taxes" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.08.155.

6. The department may refuse to accept any return that is not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon or that is not filed electronically as required in this section. When such return is not accepted, the taxpayer is deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and is subject to the procedures provided in RCW 82.32.100 and to the penalties provided in RCW 82.32.090. The above authority to refuse to accept a return may not apply when a return is timely filed electronically and a timely payment has been made by electronic funds transfer or other form of electronic payment as authorized by the department.

7. Except for returns and remittances required to be transmitted to the department electronically under this section and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a return or remittance that is transmitted to the department by United States mail is deemed filed or received on the date shown by the post office cancellation mark stamped upon the envelope containing it. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the department electronically is deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the department.

8. [Empty]

   a. For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, "good cause" means the inability of a taxpayer to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section because:

      i. The taxpayer does not have the equipment or software necessary to enable the taxpayer to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section;

      ii. The equipment or software necessary to enable the taxpayer to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section is not functioning properly;

      iii. The taxpayer does not have access to the internet using the taxpayer's own equipment;

      iv. The taxpayer does not have a bank account or a credit card;

      v. The taxpayer's bank is unable to send or receive electronic funds transfer transactions; or

      vi. Some other circumstance or condition exists that, in the department's judgment, prevents the taxpayer from complying with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

   b. "Good cause" also includes any circumstance that, in the department's judgment, supports the efficient or effective administration of the tax laws of this state, including providing relief from the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section to any taxpayer that is voluntarily collecting and remitting this state's sales or use taxes on sales to Washington customers but has no legal requirement to be registered with the department.

Supp. 1949 § 8370-191; \]

## 82.32.085 - Electronic funds transfer—Generally.
1. "Electronic funds transfer" means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated or accomplished by conventional check, drafts, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to debit or credit a checking or other deposit account. "Electronic funds transfer" includes payments made by electronic check (e-check).

2. [Empty]

   a. An electronic funds transfer using the automated clearinghouse credit method must be completed so that the state receives collectible funds on or before the next banking day following the due date.

   b. A remittance made using the automated clearinghouse debit method or any other method of electronic payment authorized by the department will be deemed to be received on the due date if the electronic funds transfer or other electronic payment is initiated on or before 11:59 p.m. pacific time on the due date with an effective payment date on or before the next banking day following the due date.

3. The department must adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions of RCW 82.32.080 and this section. The rules must include but are not limited to: (a) Coordinating the filing of tax returns with payment by electronic funds transfer or other form of electronic payment as authorized by the department; (b) form and content of electronic funds transfer; (c) voluntary use of electronic funds transfer with permission of the department for those taxpayers that are not subject to the mandatory electronic payment requirement in RCW 82.32.080; (d) use of commonly accepted means of electronic funds transfer; (e) means of crediting and recording proof of payment; and (f) means of correcting errors in transmission.

## 82.32.087 - Direct pay permits.
1. The director may grant a direct pay permit to a taxpayer who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the director, that the taxpayer meets the requirements of this section. The direct pay permit allows the taxpayer to accrue and remit directly to the department use tax on the acquisition of tangible personal property or sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and/or services, in accordance with all of the applicable provisions of this title. Any taxpayer that uses a direct pay permit must remit state and local sales or use tax directly to the department. The agreement by the purchaser to remit tax directly to the department, rather than pay sales or use tax to the seller, relieves the seller of the obligation to collect sales or use tax and requires the buyer to pay use tax on the tangible personal property and sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and/or services.

2. [Empty]

   a. A taxpayer may apply for a permit under this section if: (i) The taxpayer's cumulative tax liability is reasonably expected to be two hundred forty thousand dollars or more in the current calendar year; or (ii) the taxpayer makes purchases subject to the taxes imposed under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW in excess of ten million dollars per calendar year. For the purposes of this section, "tax liability" means the amount required to be remitted to the department for taxes administered under this chapter, except for the taxes imposed or authorized by chapters 82.14A, 82.14B, 82.24, 82.27, 82.29A, and 84.33 RCW.

   b. Application for a permit must be made in writing to the director in a form and manner prescribed by the department. A taxpayer who transacts business in two or more locations may submit one application to cover the multiple locations.

   c. The director must review a direct pay permit application in a timely manner and must notify the applicant, in writing, of the approval or denial of the application. The department must approve or deny an application based on the applicant's ability to comply with local government use tax coding capabilities and responsibilities; requirements for vendor notification; recordkeeping obligations; electronic data capabilities; and tax reporting procedures. Additionally, an application may be denied if the director determines that denial would be in the best interest of collecting taxes due under this title. The department must provide a direct pay permit to an approved applicant with the notice of approval. The direct pay permit must clearly state that the holder is solely responsible for the accrual and payment of the tax imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW and that the seller is relieved of liability to collect tax imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW on all sales to the direct pay permit holder. The taxpayer may petition the director for reconsideration of a denial.

   d. A taxpayer who uses a direct pay permit must continue to maintain records that are necessary to a determination of the tax liability in accordance with this title. A direct pay permit is not transferable and the use of a direct pay permit may not be assigned to a third party.

3. Taxes for which the direct pay permit is used are due and payable on the tax return for the reporting period in which the taxpayer (a) receives the tangible personal property purchased or in which the labor and/or services are performed or (b) receives an invoice for such property or such labor and/or services, whichever period is earlier.

4. The holder of a direct pay permit must furnish a copy of the direct pay permit to each vendor with whom the taxpayer has opted to use a direct pay permit. Sellers who make sales upon which the sales or use tax is not collected by reason of the provisions of this section, in addition to existing requirements under this title, must maintain a copy of the direct pay permit and any such records or information as the department may specify.

5. A direct pay permit is subject to revocation by the director at any time the department determines that the taxpayer has violated any provision of this section or that revocation would be in the best interests of collecting the taxes due under this title. The notice of revocation must be in writing and is effective either as of the end of the taxpayer's next normal reporting period or a date deemed appropriate by the director and identified in the revocation notice. The taxpayer may petition the director for reconsideration of a revocation and reinstatement of the permit.

6. Any taxpayer who chooses to no longer use a direct pay permit or whose permit is revoked by the department, must return the permit to the department and immediately make a good faith effort to notify all vendors to whom the permit was given, advising them that the permit is no longer valid.

7. Except as provided in this subsection, the direct pay permit may be used for any purchase of tangible personal property and any retail sale under RCW 82.04.050. The direct pay permit may not be used for:

   a. Purchases of meals or beverages;

   b. Purchases of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, airplanes, and other property subject to requirements for title transactions by the department of licensing;

   c. Purchases for which a reseller permit or other documentation authorized under RCW 82.04.470 may be used;

   d. Purchases that meet the definitions of RCW 82.04.050 (2) (e) and (f), (3) (a) through (c), (e), (f), and (g), (5), and (15); or

   e. Other activities subject to tax under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW that the department by rule designates, consistent with the purposes of this section, as activities for which a direct pay permit is not appropriate and may not be used.

## 82.32.090 - Late payment—Disregard of written instructions—Evasion—Penalties.
1. If payment of any tax due on a return to be filed by a taxpayer is not received by the department of revenue by the due date, there is assessed a penalty of nine percent of the amount of the tax; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of nineteen percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the second month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of twenty-nine percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than five dollars.

2. If the department of revenue determines that any tax has been substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax determined by the department to be due. If payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received by the department by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of fifteen percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received on or before the thirtieth day following the due date specified in the notice of tax due, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than five dollars. As used in this section, "substantially underpaid" means that the taxpayer has paid less than eighty percent of the amount of tax determined by the department to be due for all of the types of taxes included in, and for the entire period of time covered by, the department's examination, and the amount of underpayment is at least one thousand dollars.

3. If a warrant is issued by the department of revenue for the collection of taxes, increases, and penalties, there is added thereto a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax, but not less than ten dollars.

4. If the department finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the department a registration certificate as required by RCW 82.32.030, the department must impose a penalty of five percent of the amount of tax due from that person for the period that the person was not registered as required by RCW 82.32.030. The department may not impose the penalty under this subsection (4) if a person who has engaged in business taxable under this title without first having registered as required by RCW 82.32.030, prior to any notification by the department of the need to register, obtains a registration certificate from the department.

5. If the department finds that a taxpayer has disregarded specific written instructions as to reporting or tax liabilities, or willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically, as provided by RCW 82.32.080, the department must add a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax that should have been reported and/or paid electronically or the additional tax found due if there is a deficiency because of the failure to follow the instructions. A taxpayer disregards specific written instructions when the department has informed the taxpayer in writing of the taxpayer's tax obligations and the taxpayer fails to act in accordance with those instructions unless, in the case of a deficiency, the department has not issued final instructions because the matter is under appeal pursuant to this chapter or departmental regulations. The department may not assess the penalty under this section upon any taxpayer who has made a good faith effort to comply with the specific written instructions provided by the department to that taxpayer. A taxpayer will be considered to have made a good faith effort to comply with specific written instructions to file returns and/or remit taxes electronically only if the taxpayer can show good cause, as defined in RCW 82.32.080, for the failure to comply with such instructions. A taxpayer will be considered to have willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically if the department has mailed or otherwise delivered the specific written instructions to the taxpayer on at least two occasions. Specific written instructions may be given as a part of a tax assessment, audit, determination, closing agreement, or other written communication, provided that such specific written instructions apply only to the taxpayer addressed or referenced on such communication. Any specific written instructions by the department must be clearly identified as such and must inform the taxpayer that failure to follow the instructions may subject the taxpayer to the penalties imposed by this subsection. If the department determines that it is necessary to provide specific written instructions to a taxpayer that does not comply with the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.080, the specific written instructions must provide the taxpayer with a minimum of forty-five days to come into compliance with its electronic filing and/or payment obligations before the department may impose the penalty authorized in this subsection.

6. If the department finds that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from engaging in a disregarded transaction, as described in RCW 82.32.655(3), the department must assess a penalty of thirty-five percent of the additional tax found to be due as a result of engaging in a transaction disregarded by the department under RCW 82.32.655(2). The penalty provided in this subsection may be assessed together with any other applicable penalties provided in this section on the same tax found to be due, except for the evasion penalty provided in subsection (7) of this section. The department may not assess the penalty under this subsection if, before the department discovers the taxpayer's use of a transaction described under RCW 82.32.655(3), the taxpayer discloses its participation in the transaction to the department.

7. If the department finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable hereunder, a further penalty of fifty percent of the additional tax found to be due must be added.

8. The penalties imposed under subsections (1) through (4) of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.

## 82.32.100 - Failure to file returns or provide records—Assessment of tax by department—Penalties and interest.
1. If any person fails or refuses to make any return or to make available for examination the records required by this chapter, the department shall proceed, in such manner as it may deem best, to obtain facts and information on which to base its estimate of the tax; and to this end the department may examine the records of any such person as provided in RCW 82.32.110.

2. As soon as the department procures such facts and information as it is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax payable by any person who has failed or refused to make a return, it shall proceed to determine and assess against such person the tax and any applicable penalties or interest due, but such action shall not deprive such person from appealing the assessment as provided in this chapter. The department shall notify the taxpayer by mail, or electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.135, of the total amount of such tax, penalties, and interest, and the total amount shall become due and shall be paid within thirty days from the date of such notice.

3. No assessment or correction of an assessment may be made by the department more than four years after the close of the tax year, except (a) against a taxpayer who has not registered as required by this chapter, (b) upon a showing of fraud or of misrepresentation of a material fact by the taxpayer, or (c) where a taxpayer has executed a written waiver of such limitation. The execution of a written waiver shall also extend the period for making a refund or credit as provided in RCW 82.32.060(2).

## 82.32.105 - Waiver or cancellation of penalties or interest—Rules.
1. If the department finds that the payment by a taxpayer of a tax less than that properly due or the failure of a taxpayer to pay any tax by the due date was the result of circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer, the department must waive or cancel any penalties imposed under this chapter with respect to such tax.

2. The department must waive or cancel the penalty imposed under RCW 82.32.090(1) when the circumstances under which the delinquency occurred do not qualify for waiver or cancellation under subsection (1) of this section if:

   a. The taxpayer requests the waiver for a tax return required to be filed under RCW 54.28.040, 82.32.045, 82.14B.061, 82.23B.020, 82.27.060, 82.29A.050, or 84.33.086; and

   b. The taxpayer has timely filed and remitted payment on all tax returns due for that tax program for a period of twenty-four months immediately preceding the period covered by the return for which the waiver is being requested.

3. The department must waive or cancel interest imposed under this chapter if:

   a. The failure to timely pay the tax was the direct result of written instructions given the taxpayer by the department; or

   b. The extension of a due date for payment of an assessment of deficiency was not at the request of the taxpayer and was for the sole convenience of the department.

4. The department must adopt rules for the waiver or cancellation of penalties and interest imposed by this chapter.

The persons summoned may be required to testify and produce any books, papers, records, or data required by the department with respect to any tax, or the liability of any person therefor.

The director of the department of revenue, or any duly authorized agent thereof, shall have power to administer an oath to the person required to testify; and any person giving false testimony after the administration of such oath shall be guilty of perjury in the first degree.

If any person summoned as a witness before the department, or its authorized agent, fails or refuses to obey the summons, or refuses to testify or answer any material questions, or to produce any book, record, paper, or data when required to do so, the person is subject to proceedings for contempt, and the department shall thereupon institute contempt of court proceedings in the superior court of Thurston county or of the county in which such person resides.

## 82.32.117 - Application for court approval of subpoena prior to issuance—No notice required.
1. The department or its duly authorized agent may apply for and obtain a superior court order approving and authorizing a subpoena in advance of its issuance.

   b. Adequately specify the records, documents, or testimony; and

   c. Declare under oath that an investigation is being conducted for a lawfully authorized purpose related to an investigation within the department's authority and that the subpoenaed documents or testimony are reasonably related to an investigation within the department's authority.

## 82.32.135 - Notice, assessment, other information—Electronic delivery.
1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whenever the department is required to send any assessment, notice, or any other information to persons by regular mail, the department must instead provide the assessment, notice, or other information electronically. The department may implement the requirement in this subsection in phases. The department, for good cause, may waive the requirement in this subsection for any taxpayer. In the discretion of the department, a waiver under this subsection may be made temporary or permanent, and may be made on the department's own motion.

2. If the assessment, notice, or other information is subject to the confidentiality provisions of RCW 82.32.330, the department must use methods reasonably designed to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure. The provisions of this subsection (2) may be waived by a taxpayer. The waiver must be in writing and may be provided to the department electronically. A person may provide a waiver with respect to a particular item of information or may give a blanket waiver with respect to any item of information or certain items of information to be provided electronically. A blanket waiver will continue until revoked in writing by the taxpayer. Such revocation may be provided to the department electronically in a manner provided or approved by the department.

3. Any assessment, notice, or other information provided by the department electronically to a person is deemed to be received by the taxpayer on the date that the department electronically sends the information to the person or electronically notifies the person that the information is available to be accessed by the person.

4. This section also applies to any information that is not expressly required by statute to be sent by regular mail, but is customarily sent by the department using regular mail, to persons entitled to receive the information.

5. [Empty]

   a. For purposes of this section, "good cause" includes the inability of the department to comply with this section for any reason, including lacking information necessary to send information to a person electronically or to electronically notify a person that information is available to be accessed by the person.

   b. "Good cause" also includes the inability of a person to receive or otherwise obtain information from the department electronically because:

      i. The person does not have the equipment or software necessary to enable the person to receive or otherwise obtain information from the department electronically;

      ii. The equipment or software necessary to enable the person to receive or otherwise obtain information from the department electronically is not functioning properly;

## 82.32.140 - Taxpayer quitting business—Liability of successor.
1. Whenever any taxpayer quits business, or sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of more than fifty percent of the fair market value of either its tangible or intangible assets, any tax payable hereunder shall become immediately due and payable, and such taxpayer shall, within ten days thereafter, make a return and pay the tax due, unless an extension is granted under RCW 82.32.080.

2. Any person who becomes a successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due from the taxpayer until such time as the taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the department of revenue showing payment in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due. If any tax is not paid by the taxpayer within ten days from the date of such sale, exchange, or disposal, the successor shall become liable for the payment of the full amount of tax. If the fair market value of the assets acquired by a successor is less than fifty thousand dollars, the successor's liability for payment of the unpaid tax is limited to the fair market value of the assets acquired from the taxpayer. The burden of establishing the fair market value of the assets acquired is on the successor.

3. The payment of any tax by a successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price; and if such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price the amount of the difference shall become a debt due the successor from the taxpayer.

## 82.32.145 - Limited liability business entity—Terminated, dissolved, abandoned, insolvent—Collection of unpaid trust fund taxes.
1. Whenever the department has issued a warrant under RCW 82.32.210 for the collection of unpaid trust fund taxes from a limited liability business entity and that business entity has been terminated, dissolved, or abandoned, or is insolvent, the department may pursue collection of the entity's unpaid trust fund taxes, including penalties and interest on those taxes, against any or all of the responsible individuals. For purposes of this subsection, "insolvent" means the condition that results when the sum of the entity's debts exceeds the fair market value of its assets. The department may presume that an entity is insolvent if the entity refuses to disclose to the department the nature of its assets and liabilities.

2. Personal liability under this section may be imposed for state and local trust fund taxes.

3. [Empty]

   a. For a responsible individual who is the current or a former chief executive or chief financial officer, liability under this section applies regardless of fault or whether the individual was or should have been aware of the unpaid trust fund tax liability of the limited liability business entity.

   b. For any other responsible individual, liability under this section applies only if he or she willfully fails to pay or to cause to be paid to the department the trust fund taxes due from the limited liability business entity.

   a. Except as provided in this subsection (4)(a), a responsible individual who is the current or a former chief executive or chief financial officer is liable under this section only for trust fund tax liability accrued during the period that he or she was the chief executive or chief financial officer. However, if the responsible individual had the responsibility or duty to remit payment of the limited liability business entity's trust fund taxes to the department during any period of time that the person was not the chief executive or chief financial officer, that individual is also liable for trust fund tax liability that became due during the period that he or she had the duty to remit payment of the limited liability business entity's taxes to the department but was not the chief executive or chief financial officer.

   b. All other responsible individuals are liable under this section only for trust fund tax liability that became due during the period he or she had the responsibility or duty to remit payment of the limited liability business entity's taxes to the department.

5. Persons described in subsection (3)(b) of this section are exempt from liability under this section in situations where nonpayment of the limited liability business entity's trust fund taxes is due to reasons beyond their control as determined by the department by rule.

6. Any person having been issued a notice of assessment under this section is entitled to the appeal procedures under RCW 82.32.160, 82.32.170, 82.32.180, 82.32.190, and 82.32.200.

## 82.32.180 - Court appeal—Procedure.
Any person, except one who has failed to keep and preserve books, records, and invoices as required in this chapter and chapter 82.24 RCW, having paid any tax as required and feeling aggrieved by the amount of the tax may appeal to the superior court of Thurston county, within the time limitation for a refund provided in chapter 82.32 RCW or, if an application for refund has been made to the department within that time limitation, then within thirty days after rejection of the application, whichever time limitation is later. In the appeal the taxpayer shall set forth the amount of the tax imposed upon the taxpayer which the taxpayer concedes to be the correct tax and the reason why the tax should be reduced or abated. The appeal shall be perfected by serving a copy of the notice of appeal upon the department within the time herein specified and by filing the original thereof with proof of service with the clerk of the superior court of Thurston county.

The trial in the superior court on appeal shall be de novo and without the necessity of any pleadings other than the notice of appeal. At trial, the burden shall rest upon the taxpayer to prove that the tax as paid by the taxpayer is incorrect, either in whole or in part, and to establish the correct amount of the tax. In such proceeding the taxpayer shall be deemed the plaintiff, and the state, the defendant; and both parties shall be entitled to subpoena the attendance of witnesses as in other civil actions and to produce evidence that is competent, relevant, and material to determine the correct amount of the tax that should be paid by the taxpayer. Either party may seek appellate review in the same manner as other civil actions are appealed to the appellate courts.

It shall not be necessary for the taxpayer to protest against the payment of any tax or to make any demand to have the same refunded or to petition the director for a hearing in order to appeal to the superior court, but no court action or proceeding of any kind shall be maintained by the taxpayer to recover any tax paid, or any part thereof, except as herein provided.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to any tax payment which has been the subject of an appeal to the board of tax appeals with respect to which appeal a formal hearing has been elected.

1.

## 82.32.210 - Tax warrant—Filing—Lien—Effect.
1. If any fee, tax, increase, or penalty or any portion thereof is not paid within fifteen days after it becomes due, the department may issue a warrant in the amount of the unpaid sums, together with interest thereon from the date the warrant is issued until the date of payment. If, however, the department believes that a taxpayer is about to cease business, leave the state, or remove or dissipate the assets out of which fees, taxes or penalties might be satisfied and that any tax or penalty will not be paid when due, it may declare the fee, tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

   a. Interest imposed before January 1, 1999, is computed at the rate of one percent of the amount of the warrant for each thirty days or portion thereof.

   b. Interest imposed after December 31, 1998, is computed on a daily basis on the amount of outstanding tax or fee at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(2). The rate so computed must be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year. As used in this subsection, "fee" does not include an administrative filing fee such as a court filing fee and warrant fee.

2. Except as provided in RCW 82.32.212, the department must file a copy of the warrant with the clerk of the superior court of any county of the state in which real and/or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. The clerk is entitled to a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10). Upon filing, the clerk will enter in the judgment docket, the name of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant and in appropriate columns the amount of the fee, tax or portion thereof and any increases and penalties for which the warrant is issued and the date when the copy is filed. The amount of the warrant so docketed is a specific lien upon all goods, wares, merchandise, fixtures, equipment, or other personal property used in the conduct of the business of the taxpayer against whom the warrant is issued, including property owned by third persons who have a beneficial interest, direct or indirect, in the operation of the business, and no sale or transfer of the personal property in any way affects the lien.

3. The lien is not superior, however, to bona fide interests of third persons that vested before the filing of the warrant when the third persons do not have a beneficial interest, direct or indirect, in the operation of the business, other than to secure payment of a debt or to receive a regular rental on equipment. The phrase "bona fide interests of third persons" does not include any mortgage of real or personal property or any other credit transaction that results in the mortgagee or the holder of the security acting as trustee for unsecured creditors of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant who executed the chattel or real property mortgage or the document evidencing the credit transaction.

4. The amount of the warrant so docketed is also a lien upon the title to and interest in all other real and personal property of the taxpayer against whom it is issued the same as a judgment in a civil case duly docketed in the office of the clerk. The warrant so docketed is sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the state as provided by law for judgments wholly or partially unsatisfied.

## 82.32.212 - Tax warrant—Notice of lien.
1. To secure payment of a tax warrant issued by the department under RCW 82.32.210, the department may issue a notice of lien against any real property in which the taxpayer against whom the warrant was issued has an ownership interest, if the total amount for which the warrant was issued exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars and the department determines that issuing the notice of lien would best protect the state's interest in collecting the amount due on the warrant. The department must file the notice of lien with the recording officer of the county where the real property is located. The recording officer is entitled to a filing fee as provided under RCW 36.18.010.

2. [Empty]

   a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, recording a notice of lien as authorized in this section is in lieu of filing with the clerk of the superior court a copy of the warrant secured by the notice of lien.

   b. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection (2), the department may file with the superior court a warrant that is secured by a notice of lien under this section if: (i) The department determines that filing the warrant is in the best interest of collecting the amount due on the tax warrant; or (ii) the warrant remains unpaid six months after the notice of lien was issued.

3. If a warrant has been filed with the clerk of the superior court, the department may issue and record a notice of lien against real property of the taxpayer and file a conditional satisfaction of the warrant with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the warrant was filed, if the department determines that such actions are in the best interest of collecting the amount due on the warrant.

   a. A warrant for which a conditional satisfaction is filed will continue to accrue interest on the unpaid balance as provided in RCW 82.32.210.

   b. [Empty]

      i. The department may refile a warrant for which a conditional satisfaction has been filed if: (A) The department determines that refiling the warrant is in the best interest of collecting the amount due on the warrant; or (B) the warrant remains unpaid six months after the notice of lien was issued.

      ii. A warrant is refiled in the same manner as it was originally filed.

   c. A warrant that is refiled as provided in this subsection (3) reinstates the liens provided under RCW 82.32.210 as of the date the warrant is refiled.

   d. For the purposes of this subsection (3), a "conditional satisfaction" is a document issued by the department, which, when filed with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the warrant was filed, releases the liens provided under RCW 82.32.210 without prejudice to refile the warrant at a later date.

4. When a taxpayer has requested the department to use the collection authority under this section, in order to determine if the issuance of a notice of lien would best protect the state's interest in collecting the amount due on the warrant, the department may require the taxpayer to:

   a. Provide, at the taxpayer's expense, the department with a current abstract of title as defined by RCW 48.29.010 from a title insurer that possesses a certificate of authority issued under Title 48 RCW; and

   b. Authorize the department to obtain the taxpayer's current credit report.

5. A notice of lien issued under this section must include the following information:

   a. The name of the taxpayer who has an interest in the real property against which the notice of lien is filed;

   b. The taxpayer's tax registration number issued as provided in RCW 82.32.030;

   c. The number of the warrant issued by the department;

   d. The amount for which the warrant was issued;

   e. The legal description, tax parcel number assigned under RCW 84.40.160, and the street address, if available, of the real property against which the notice of lien is issued; and

   f. Any other information the department determines would be useful.

6. The notice of lien issued under this section is superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except:

   a. Bona fide interests of third persons that had vested prior to the recording of the notice of lien, if the third persons do not have a beneficial interest, direct or indirect, in the operation of the taxpayer's business, other than the securing of the payment of a debt or the receiving of a regular rental on equipment. For purposes of this subsection, "bona fide interests of third persons" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.210; and

   b. Property taxes and special assessments against the property.

7. The department must release a notice of lien issued under this section as soon as practicable after receipt of payment in full of the amount due on the warrant secured by the notice of lien, including interest accrued as provided in RCW 82.32.210(1) and all recording fees claimed by the recording officer for the recording of the notice of lien and the release of the lien.

8. The department must release a notice of lien issued under this section within fourteen days if the notice of lien was issued in error.

      i. [Empty]

         A.  The taxpayer was convicted of violating RCW 82.32.290(4) and continues to engage in business without fully complying with RCW 82.32.290(4)(b) (i) through (iii); or

         B.  A person convicted of violating RCW 82.32.290(4) is an owner, officer, director, partner, trustee, member, or manager of the taxpayer, and the person and taxpayer have not fully complied with RCW 82.32.290(4)(b) (i) through (iii).

      ii. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(c), the terms "manager," "member," and "officer" mean the same as defined in RCW 82.32.145.

2. If the department enters a final order revoking a taxpayer's certificate of registration, a copy of the order must, if practicable, be posted in a conspicuous place at the main entrance to the taxpayer's place of business. The department may also post a final order revoking a taxpayer's certificate of registration in any public facility, such as a courthouse or post office, as may be allowed by the public entity that owns or occupies the facility. A final order posted at the taxpayer's place of business must remain posted until such time as the taxpayer is eligible to have its certificate of registration reinstated as provided in subsection (3) of this section or has abandoned the premises. A taxpayer will not be deemed to have abandoned the premises if the taxpayer or any person with an ownership interest in the taxpayer continues to operate a substantially similar type of business under a different legal entity at the same location.

3. Any certificate revoked under subsection (1) of this section may not be reinstated, nor may a new certificate of registration be issued to the taxpayer, until:

   a. The amount due on the warrant has been paid, or provisions for payment satisfactory to the department have been entered, and until the taxpayer has deposited with the department security for payment of any taxes, increases, and penalties, due or which may become due in an amount and under such terms and conditions as the department of revenue may require, but the amount of the security may not be greater than one-half the estimated average annual liability of the taxpayer; or

   b. The taxpayer and, if applicable, the owner, officer, director, partner, trustee, member, or manager of the taxpayer who was convicted of violating RCW 82.32.290(4) are in full compliance with RCW 82.32.290(4)(b) (i) through (iii), if the certificate of registration was revoked under the provisions of subsection (1)(c) of this section.

The sheriff shall thereupon proceed upon the same in all respects and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgments of the superior court.

The sheriff shall be entitled to fees as provided by law for the sheriff's services in levying execution on a superior court judgment and the clerk shall be entitled to a filing fee as provided by law, which shall be added to the amount of the warrant.

The proceeds received from any sale shall be credited upon the amount due under the warrant and when the final amount due is received, together with interest, penalties, and costs, the judgment docket shall show the claim for taxes to be satisfied and the clerk of the court shall so note upon the docket. Any surplus received from any sale of property shall be paid to the taxpayer or to any lienholder entitled thereto. If the return on the warrant shows that the same has not been satisfied in full, the amount of the deficiency shall remain the same as a judgment against the taxpayer which may be collected in the same manner as the original amount of the warrant.

## 82.32.235 - Notice and order to withhold and deliver property due or owned by taxpayer—Bond—Judgment by default.
1. In addition to the remedies provided in this chapter the department is authorized to issue to any person, including the department, a notice and order to withhold and deliver property of any kind whatsoever when there is reason to believe that there is in the possession of such person, property which is or will become due, owing, or belonging to any taxpayer against whom a warrant has been filed.

2. The sheriff of the county where the service is made, or his or her deputy, or any duly authorized representative of the department may personally serve the notice and order to withhold and deliver upon the person to whom it is directed or may do so by certified mail, with return receipt requested. Upon written consent of the person to be served, a notice and order to withhold and deliver issued under subsection (1) of this section may be served electronically.

3. [Empty]

   a. The department is authorized to issue a notice and order to withhold and deliver to any financial institution in the form of a listing of all or a portion of the unsatisfied tax warrants filed under this chapter and outstanding warrants under RCW 49.48.086 with the clerk of the superior court of a county of the state, except tax warrants subject to a payment agreement, which is not in default, between the department and the taxpayer. The department may also issue a notice and order to withhold and deliver in the form authorized in this subsection (3)(a) to itself or any other person upon that person's written consent.

   b. The department may serve the notice and order to withhold and deliver authorized under this subsection electronically. The remedy in this subsection (3) is in addition to any other remedies authorized by law.

   e. For purposes of this subsection, "financial institution" means a bank, trust company, mutual savings bank, savings and loan association, or credit union authorized to do business and accept deposits in this state under state or federal law.

   f. The department may provide a financial institution relief from a notice and order to withhold and deliver in the form provided under this subsection (3) upon the request of the financial institution.

6. Should any person, having been served with a notice and order to withhold and deliver, fail to answer the notice and order to withhold and deliver within the time prescribed in this section or otherwise fail to comply with the duties imposed in this section, the department may bring a proceeding, in the superior court of Thurston county or of the county in which service of the notice was made, to enforce the notice and order to withhold and deliver. The court may render judgment by default against such person for the full amount claimed by the department in the notice and order to withhold and deliver or may grant such other relief as the court deems just, together with costs.

7. For purposes of this section, "person" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.030 and also includes any agency, department, or institution of the state.

In all cases of probate, insolvency, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or bankruptcy, involving any taxpayer who is, or decedent who was, engaging in business, the claim of the state for said taxes and all increases and penalties thereon shall be a lien upon all real and personal property of the taxpayer, and the mere existence of such cases or conditions shall be sufficient to create such lien without any prior or subsequent action by the state, and in all such cases it shall be the duty of all administrators, executors, guardians, receivers, trustees in bankruptcy or assignees for the benefit of creditors, to notify the department of revenue of such administration, receivership or assignment within sixty days from the date of their appointment and qualification.

The lien provided for by this section shall attach as of the date of the assignment for the benefit of creditors or of the initiation of the probate, insolvency, or bankruptcy proceedings: PROVIDED, That this sentence shall not be construed as affecting the validity or priority of any earlier lien that may have attached previously in favor of the state under any other section of this title.

Any administrator, executor, guardian, receiver or assignee for the benefit of creditors not giving the notification as provided for above shall become personally liable for payment of the taxes and all increases and penalties thereon to the extent of the value of the property subject to administration that otherwise would have been available for the payment of such taxes, increases, and penalties by the administrator, executor, guardian, receiver, or assignee.

As used in this section, "probate" includes the nonprobate claim settlement procedure under chapter 11.42 RCW, and "executor" and "administrator" includes any notice agent acting under chapter 11.42 RCW.

In such cases, the buyer bears the burden of proving that it did not improperly use its reseller permit to make the purchase without payment of sales tax.

Before disclosure of any tax return or tax information under this subsection (4), the department must, through written correspondence, inform the person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed. The correspondence must clearly identify the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed. The department may not disclose any tax return or tax information under this subsection (4) until the time period allowed in (c) of this subsection has expired or until the court has ruled on any challenge brought under (c) of this subsection.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this section, a person served with a subpoena under RCW 82.32.117 may disclose the existence or content of the subpoena to that person's legal counsel.

## 82.32.340 - Chargeoff of uncollectible taxes—Destruction of files and records.
1. Any tax or penalty which the department of revenue deems to be uncollectible may be transferred from accounts receivable to a suspense account and cease to be accounted an asset. Any item transferred shall continue to be a debt due the state from the taxpayer and may at any time within twelve years from the filing of a warrant covering such amount with the clerk of the superior court be transferred back to accounts receivable for the purpose of collection. The department of revenue may charge off as finally uncollectible any tax or penalty which it deems uncollectible at any time after twelve years from the date that the last tax return for the delinquent taxpayer was or should have been filed if the department of revenue is satisfied that there are no cost-effective means of collecting the tax or penalty.

After any tax or penalty has been charged off as finally uncollectible under the provisions of this section, the department of revenue may destroy any or all files and records pertaining to the liability of any taxpayer for such tax or penalty.

The department of revenue, subject to the approval of the state records committee, may at the expiration of five years after the close of any taxable year, destroy any or all files and records pertaining to the tax liability of any taxpayer for such taxable year, who has fully paid all taxes, penalties and interest for such taxable year, or any preceding taxable year for which such taxes, penalties and interest have been fully paid. In the event that such files and records are reproduced on film pursuant to RCW 40.20.020 for use in accordance with RCW 40.20.030, the original files and records may be destroyed immediately after reproduction and such reproductions may be destroyed at the expiration of the above five-year period, subject to the approval of the state records committee.

2. Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the department may charge off any tax within its jurisdiction to collect that is owed by a taxpayer, including any penalty or interest thereon, if the department ascertains that the cost of collecting that tax would be greater than the total amount which is owed or likely in the near future to be owed by, and collectible from, the taxpayer.

   b. [Empty]

      i. An electronic database, whether provided by the department or the designated database provider, shall be provided in a format approved by the American national standards institute's accredited standards committee X12, that after allowing for de minimis deviations, designates for each street address in the state, including to the extent practicable, any multiple postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, and the appropriate code for each taxing jurisdiction, for each level of taxing jurisdiction, identified by one nationwide standard numeric code.

      ii. An electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code for each street address with respect to political subdivisions that are not taxing jurisdictions when reasonably needed to determine the proper taxing jurisdiction.

      iii. The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the same number of numeric digits with each digit or combination of digits referring to the same level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States using a format similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the federation of tax administrators and the multistate tax commission, or their successors. Each address shall be provided in standard postal format.

2. The department or designated database provider, as applicable, that provides or maintains an electronic database described in subsection (1) of this section shall provide notice of the availability of the then-current electronic database, and any subsequent revisions, by publication in the manner normally employed for the publication of informational tax, charge, or fee notices to taxpayers in the state.

3. A mobile telecommunications service provider using the data contained in an electronic database described in subsection (1) of this section shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of any error or omission in the database provided by the department or designated database provider. The mobile telecommunications service provider shall reflect changes made to the database during a calendar quarter not later than thirty days after the end of the calendar quarter if the department or designated database provider, as applicable, has issued notice of the availability of an electronic database reflecting the changes under subsection (2) of this section.

## 82.32.495 - Liability of mobile telecommunications service provider if no database provided.
1. If neither the department nor the designated database provider provides an electronic database under RCW 82.32.490, a mobile telecommunications service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in any taxing jurisdiction in this state that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction if, subject to RCW 82.32.500, the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction for each level of taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to ensure that each street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within the enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code for each level of taxing jurisdiction. Any enhanced zip code assignment changed in accordance with RCW 82.32.500 is deemed to be in compliance with this section. For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if the home service provider demonstrates that it has:

   a. Expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;

   b. Implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions promptly; and

   c. Used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of the database.

2. Subsection (1) of this section applies to a mobile telecommunications service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, if in this state an electronic database has not been provided under RCW 82.32.490, until the later of:

   a. Eighteen months after the nationwide standard numeric code described in RCW 82.32.490(1) has been approved by the federation of tax administrators and the multistate tax commission; or

   b. Six months after the department or a designated database provider in this state provides the database as prescribed in RCW 82.32.490(1).

## 82.32.500 - Determination of taxing jurisdiction for telecommunications services.
A taxing jurisdiction, or the department on behalf of any taxing jurisdiction or taxing jurisdictions within this state, may:

1. Determine that the address used for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees for mobile telecommunications services are remitted does not meet the definition of place of primary use in RCW 82.04.065 and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination. If the authority making the determination is not the department, the taxing jurisdiction must obtain the consent of all affected taxing jurisdictions within the state before giving the notice of determination. Before the taxing jurisdiction gives the notice of determination, the customer must be given an opportunity to demonstrate, in accordance with applicable state or local tax, charge, or fee administrative procedures, that the address is the customer's place of primary use; and

2. Determine that the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider under RCW 82.32.495 does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the assignment on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination. If the authority making the determination is not the department, the taxing jurisdiction must obtain the consent of all affected taxing jurisdictions within the state before giving the notice of determination. The home service provider must be given an opportunity to demonstrate, in accordance with applicable state or local tax, charge, or fee administrative procedures, that the assignment reflects the correct taxing jurisdiction.

## 82.32.505 - Telecommunications services—Place of primary use.
1. A home service provider is responsible for obtaining and maintaining information regarding the customer's place of primary use as defined in RCW 82.04.065. Subject to RCW 82.32.500, and if the home service provider's reliance on information provided by its customer is in good faith, a taxing jurisdiction shall:

   a. Allow a home service provider to rely on the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider's customer; and

   b. Not hold a mobile telecommunications service provider liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a different determination of the place of primary use.

2. Except as provided in RCW 82.32.500, a taxing jurisdiction shall allow a home service provider to treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect on August 1, 2002, as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of the service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of the service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees on charges for mobile telecommunications services are remitted.

## 82.32.510 - Scope of mobile telecommunications act—Identification of taxable and nontaxable charges.
1. Chapter 67, Laws of 2002 does not modify, impair, supersede, or authorize the modification, impairment, or supersession of any law allowing a taxing jurisdiction to collect a tax, charge, or fee from a customer that has failed to provide its place of primary use.

2. If a taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation and if these charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges that are subject to taxation, then the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services may be subject to taxation unless the mobile telecommunications service provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to the tax, charge, or fee from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business.

3. If a taxing jurisdiction does not subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation, a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for mobile telecommunications services unless the customer's home service provider separately states the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.

   a. [Empty]

      i. Beginning in calendar year 2018, every person claiming a tax preference that requires an annual tax performance report under this section must file a complete annual report with the department. The report is due by May 31st of the year following any calendar year in which a person becomes eligible to claim the tax preference that requires a report under this section.

      ii. If the tax preference is a deferral of tax, the first annual tax performance report must be filed by May 31st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the investment project is certified by the department as operationally complete. An annual tax performance report must also be filed by May 31st of each succeeding calendar year through the calendar year in which the deferred taxes are fully repaid or are immediately due and payable because the recipient of the deferral is no longer eligible for the deferral.

      iii. The department may extend the due date for timely filing of annual reports under this section as provided in RCW 82.32.590.

   b. The report must include information detailing employment and wages for employment positions in Washington for the year that the tax preference was claimed. However, persons engaged in manufacturing commercial airplanes or components of such airplanes may report employment and wage information per job at the manufacturing site for the year that the tax preference was claimed. The report must not include names of employees. The report must also detail employment by the total number of full-time, part-time, and temporary positions for the year that the tax preference was claimed. In lieu of reporting employment and wage data required under this subsection, taxpayers may instead opt to allow the employment security department to release the same employment and wage information from unemployment insurance records to the department and the joint legislative audit and review committee. This option is intended to reduce the reporting burden for taxpayers, and each taxpayer electing to use this option must affirm that election in accordance with procedures approved by the employment security department.

   c. Persons receiving the benefit of the tax preference provided by RCW 82.16.0421 or claiming any of the tax preferences provided by RCW 82.04.2909, 82.04.4481, 82.08.805, 82.12.805, or 82.12.022(5) must indicate on the annual report the quantity of product produced in this state during the time period covered by the report.

   a. As part of the annual report, the department and the joint legislative audit and review committee may request additional information necessary to measure the results of, or determine eligibility for, the tax preference.

   b. The report must include the amount of the tax preference claimed for the calendar year covered by the report. For a person that claimed an exemption provided in RCW 82.08.025651 or 82.12.025651, the report must include the amount of tax exempted under those sections in the prior calendar year for each general area or category of research and development for which exempt machinery and equipment and labor and services were acquired in the prior calendar year.

3. Other than information requested under subsection (2)(a) of this section, the information contained in an annual report filed under this section is not subject to the confidentiality provisions of RCW 82.32.330 and may be disclosed to the public upon request.

4. [Empty]

   a. Except as otherwise provided by law, if a person claims a tax preference that requires an annual report under this section but fails to submit a complete report by the due date or any extension under RCW 82.32.590, the department must declare:

      i. Thirty-five percent of the amount of the tax preference claimed for the previous calendar year to be immediately due and payable;

      ii. An additional fifteen percent of the amount of the tax preference claimed for the previous calendar year to be immediately due and payable if the person has previously been assessed under this subsection (4) for failure to submit a report under this section for the same tax preference; and

      iii. If the tax preference is a deferral of tax, the amount immediately due under this subsection is the deferred tax divided by the number of years in the repayment period. If the economic benefits of the deferral are passed to a lessee, the lessee is responsible for payment to the extent the lessee has received the economic benefit.

   b. The department may not assess interest or penalties on amounts due under this subsection.

5. The department must use the information from this section to prepare summary descriptive statistics by category. No fewer than three taxpayers may be included in any category. The department must report these statistics to the legislature each year by December 31st.

6. For the purposes of this section:

   b. "Tax preference" has the meaning provided in RCW 43.136.021 and includes only the tax preferences requiring a report under this section.

## 82.32.655 - Tax avoidance.
1. It is the legislature's intent to require all taxpayers to pay their fair share of taxes. To accomplish this purpose, it is the legislature's intent to stop transactions or arrangements that are designed to unfairly avoid taxes.

2. The department must disregard, for tax purposes, the tax avoidance transactions or arrangements that are described in subsection (3) of this section. The department must deny the tax benefit that would otherwise result from the tax avoidance transaction or arrangement. In determining whether the department must disregard a transaction or arrangement described under subsection (3) of this section, the department may consider:

   a. Whether an arrangement or transaction changes in a meaningful way, apart from its tax effects, the economic positions of the participants in the arrangement when considered as a whole;

   b. Whether substantial nontax reasons exist for entering into an arrangement or transaction;

   c. Whether an arrangement or transaction is a reasonable means of accomplishing a substantial nontax purpose;

   d. An entities' relative contributions to the work that generates income;

   e. The location where work is performed; and

   f. Other relevant factors.

   b. Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 82.04 RCW by disguising income received, or otherwise avoiding tax on income, from a person that is not affiliated with the taxpayer from business activities that would be taxable in Washington by moving that income to another entity that would not be taxable in Washington; and

   c. Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW by engaging in a transaction to disguise its purchase or use of tangible personal property by vesting legal title or other ownership interest in another entity over which the taxpayer exercises control in such a manner as to effectively retain control of the tangible personal property.

4. In determining whether a transaction or arrangement comes within the scope of subsection (3) of this section, the department is not required to prove a taxpayer's subjective intent in engaging in the transaction or arrangement.

5. The department must adopt rules to assist in determining whether a transaction or arrangement is within the scope of subsection (3) of this section. The adoption of a rule as required under this subsection is not a condition precedent for the department's exercise of the authority provided in this section. Any rules adopted under this section must include examples of transactions that the department will disregard for tax purposes.

6. This section does not affect the department's authority to apply any other remedies available under statutory or common law.

7. For purposes of this section, "affiliated" means under common control. "Control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise.

      ii. The department or the law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the property was used or is intended to be used in violation of RCW 82.32.290(4) and exigent circumstances exist making procurement of a search warrant impracticable.

2. Forfeiture authorized by this section is deemed to have commenced by the seizure. Notice of seizure must be given to the department if the seizure is made by a law enforcement officer without the presence of any agent of the department. The department must cause notice of the seizure and intended forfeiture to be served on the owner of the property seized, if known, and on any other person known by the department to have a right or interest in the seized property.

Service by certified mail or electronic means is deemed complete upon mailing the notice, electronically sending the notice, or electronically notifying the person or persons entitled to the notice that the notice is available to be accessed by the person or persons, within the fifteen-day period following the seizure or the department's receipt of notification of the seizure.

3. If no person notifies the department in writing of the person's claim of lawful ownership or right to lawful possession of the item or items seized within thirty days of the date of service of the notice of seizure and intended forfeiture, the item or items seized are deemed forfeited.

4. [Empty]

   a.

The hearing must be before the director or the director's designee. A hearing and any administrative or judicial review is governed by chapter 34.05 RCW. The burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence is upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the item or items seized.

   b. The department must return the item or items to the claimant as soon as possible upon a determination that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession of the item or items seized.

5. When property is sought to be forfeited on the ground that it constitutes proceeds traceable to a violation of RCW 82.32.290(4), the department must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property constitutes proceeds traceable to a violation of RCW 82.32.290(4).

6. [Empty]

   a. When automated sales suppression devices or phantom-ware voluntarily surrendered to an agent of the department, or property forfeited under this section, other than proceeds traceable to a violation of RCW 82.32.290(4), is no longer required for evidentiary purposes, the department may:

      i. Destroy or have the property destroyed;

      ii. Retain the property for training or other official purposes; or

## 82.32.715 - Monetary allowances—Streamlined sales and use tax agreement.
1. The department must adopt by rule monetary allowances for certified service providers selected by model 1 sellers and also for model 2 sellers. The department may be guided by the provisions for monetary allowances adopted by the governing board of the agreement to determine the amount of the allowances and the conditions under which they are allowed. The monetary allowances must be reasonable and provide adequate incentive for certified service providers and sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes under the agreement. Monetary allowances will be funded solely from state sales and use taxes. The department may modify its rules for monetary allowances in light of the holding of the United States supreme court in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., Docket No. 17-494, issued June 21, 2018.

2. For certified service providers, the monetary allowance may include a base rate that applies to taxable transactions processed by the certified service provider.

3. For model 2 sellers, the monetary allowance may include a base rate and a percentage of revenue generated by a seller registering under RCW 82.32.030(3), but may not exceed a period of twenty-four months.

1. The department may adopt by rule vendor compensation for sellers collecting and remitting sales and use taxes.

The department may be guided by the findings of the cost of collection study performed under the agreement, by cost of collection studies performed by the department, and by vendor compensation provided by other states, to determine reasonable vendor compensation for sellers for the costs to collect and remit sales and use taxes. Vendor compensation will be funded solely from state sales and use taxes.

2. A seller is not entitled to vendor compensation while the seller or its certified service provider receives a monetary allowance under RCW 82.32.715.

1. [Empty]

   a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, every new tax preference expires on the first day of the calendar year that is subsequent to the calendar year that is ten years from the effective date of the tax preference. With respect to any new property tax exemption, the exemption does not apply to taxes levied for collection beginning in the calendar year that is subsequent to the calendar year that is ten years from the effective date of the tax preference.

   b. If a new tax preference applies to both a state tax and a corresponding local tax that the department administers, such as a state and local sales and use tax exemption, the expiration of that new tax preference under this subsection applies to both the state and local tax.

   c. A future amendment that expands a tax preference does not extend the tax preference beyond the period provided in this subsection unless an extension is expressly and unambiguously stated in the amendment.

2. Subsection (1) of this section does not apply if legislation creating a new tax preference includes an expiration date for the new tax preference or an exemption from this section in its entirety or from the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, whether or not such exemption is codified.

3. Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to any existing tax preference that is amended to clarify an ambiguity or correct a technical inconsistency. Future enacted legislation intended to make such clarifications or corrections must explicitly indicate this intent.

4. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

   a. "New tax preference" means a tax preference that initially takes effect after August 1, 2013, or a tax preference in effect as of August 1, 2013, that is expanded or extended after August 1, 2013, even if the expanding or extending amendment includes any other change to the tax preference.

   b. "Tax preference" has the same meaning as in RCW 43.136.021 with respect to any state tax administered by the department, except does not include the Washington estate and transfer tax in chapter 83.100 RCW.

5. The department must provide written notice to the office of the code reviser of a ten-year expiration date required under this section for a new tax preference.

## 82.32.808 - Tax preferences—Performance statement requirement.
1. As provided in this section, every bill enacting a new tax preference must include a tax preference performance statement, unless the legislation enacting the new tax preference contains an explicit exemption from the requirements of this section.

2. A tax preference performance statement must state the legislative purpose for the new tax preference. The tax preference performance statement must indicate one or more of the following general categories, by reference to the applicable category specified in this subsection, as the legislative purpose of the new tax preference:

   a. Tax preferences intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers;

   b. Tax preferences intended to improve industry competitiveness;

   c. Tax preferences intended to create or retain jobs;

   d. Tax preferences intended to reduce structural inefficiencies in the tax structure;

   e. Tax preferences intended to provide tax relief for certain businesses or individuals; or

   f. A general purpose not identified in (a) through (e) of this subsection.

3. In addition to identifying the general legislative purpose of the tax preference under subsection (2) of this section, the tax preference performance statement must provide additional detailed information regarding the legislative purpose of the new tax preference.

4. A new tax preference performance statement must specify clear, relevant, and ascertainable metrics and data requirements that allow the joint legislative audit and review committee and the legislature to measure the effectiveness of the new tax preference in achieving the purpose designated under subsection (2) of this section.

5. If the tax preference performance statement for a new tax preference indicates a legislative purpose described in subsection (2)(b) or (c) of this section, any taxpayer claiming the new tax preference must file an annual tax performance report in accordance with RCW 82.32.534.

6. [Empty]

   a. Taxpayers claiming a new tax preference must report the amount of the tax preference claimed by the taxpayer to the department as otherwise required by statute or determined by the department as part of the taxpayer's regular tax reporting responsibilities. For new tax preferences allowing certain types of gross income of the business to be excluded from business and occupation or public utility taxation, the tax return must explicitly report the amount of the exclusion, regardless of whether it is structured as an exemption or deduction, if the taxpayer is otherwise required to report taxes to the department on a monthly or quarterly basis. For a new sales and use tax exemption, the total purchase price or value of the exempt product or service subject to the exemption claimed by the buyer must be reported on an addendum to the buyer's tax return if the buyer is otherwise required to report taxes to the department on a monthly or quarterly basis and the buyer is required to submit an exemption certificate, or similar document, to the seller.

   b. This subsection does not apply to:

      i. Property tax exemptions;

      ii. Tax preferences required by constitutional law;

      iii. Tax preferences for which the tax benefit to the taxpayer is less than one thousand dollars per calendar year; or

      iv. Taxpayers who are annual filers.

   c. The department may waive the filing requirements of this subsection for taxpayers who are not required to file electronically any return or report under this chapter.

7. [Empty]

   a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the amount claimed by a taxpayer for any new tax preference is subject to public disclosure and is not considered confidential tax information under RCW 82.32.330, if the reporting periods subject to disclosure ended at least twenty-four months prior to the date of disclosure and the taxpayer is required to report the amount of the tax preference claimed by the taxpayer to the department under subsection (6) of this section.

   b. [Empty]

      i. The department may waive the public disclosure requirement under (a) of this subsection (7) for good cause. Good cause may be demonstrated by a reasonable showing of economic harm to a taxpayer if the information specified under this subsection is disclosed. The waiver under this subsection (7)(b)(i) only applies to the new tax preferences provided in chapter 13, Laws of 2013 2nd sp. sess.

      ii. The amount of the tax preference claimed by a taxpayer during a calendar year is confidential under RCW 82.32.330 and may not be disclosed under this subsection if the amount for the calendar year is less than ten thousand dollars.

   c. In lieu of the disclosure and waiver requirements under this subsection, the requirements under RCW 82.32.534 apply to any tax preference that requires a tax performance report.

8. If a new tax preference does not include the information required under subsections (2) through (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee is not required to perform a tax preference review under chapter 43.136 RCW, and it is legislatively presumed that it is the intent of the legislature to allow the new tax preference to expire upon its scheduled expiration date.

9. For the purposes of this section, "tax preference" and "new tax preference" have the same meaning as provided in RCW 82.32.805.

10. The provisions of this section do not apply to the extent that legislation creating a new tax preference provides an exemption, in whole or in part, from this section, whether or not such exemption is codified.
