## 82.14.010 - Legislative finding—Purpose.
The legislature finds that the several counties and cities of the state lack adequate sources of revenue to carry out essential county and municipal purposes. The legislature further finds that the most efficient and appropriate methods of deriving revenues for such purposes is to vest additional taxing powers in the governing bodies of counties and cities which they may or may not implement. The legislature intends, by enacting this chapter, to provide the means by which essential county and municipal purposes can be financially served should they choose to employ them.

For purposes of this chapter:

1. "City" means a city or town;

2. The meaning ascribed to words and phrases in chapters 82.04, 82.08 and 82.12 RCW, as now or hereafter amended, insofar as applicable, has full force and effect with respect to taxes imposed under authority of this chapter. However, the terms "retail sale" and "sale at retail" have only the meaning provided in RCW 82.08.010 for the purposes of this chapter, unless the context clearly requires that a different definition apply;

3. "Taxable event" means any retail sale, or any use, upon which a state tax is imposed pursuant to chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW, as they now exist or may hereafter be amended. However, the term does not include a retail sale taxable pursuant to RCW 82.08.150, as now or hereafter amended; and

4. "Treasurer or other legal depository" means the treasurer or legal depository of a county or city.

## 82.14.030 - Sales and use taxes authorized—Additional taxes authorized—Maximum rates.
1. The governing body of any county or city, while not required by legislative mandate to do so, may, by resolution or ordinance for the purposes authorized by this chapter, impose a sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter. Such tax must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW, upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the county or city as the case may be. This sales and use tax does not apply to natural or manufactured gas, except for natural gas that is used as a transportation fuel as defined in RCW 82.16.310 and is taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW. The rate of such tax imposed by a county is five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). The rate of such tax imposed by a city may not exceed five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). However, in the event a county imposes a sales and use tax under this subsection, the rate of such tax imposed under this subsection by any city therein may not exceed four hundred and twenty-five one-thousandths of one percent.

2. In addition to the tax authorized in subsection (1) of this section, the governing body of any county or city may by resolution or ordinance impose an additional sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter. Such additional tax must be collected upon the same taxable events upon which the tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section is imposed. The rate of such additional tax imposed by a county is up to five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). The rate of such additional tax imposed by a city is up to five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). However, in the event a county imposes a sales and use tax under the authority of this subsection at a rate equal to or greater than the rate imposed under the authority of this subsection by a city within the county, the county must receive fifteen percent of the city tax. In the event that the county imposes a sales and use tax under the authority of this subsection at a rate which is less than the rate imposed under this subsection by a city within the county, the county must receive that amount of revenues from the city tax equal to fifteen percent of the rate of tax imposed by the county under the authority of this subsection. The authority to impose a tax under this subsection is intended in part to compensate local government for any losses from the phaseout of the property tax on business inventories.

Any referendum petition to repeal a county or city ordinance imposing a tax or altering the rate of the tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(2) shall be filed with a filing officer, as identified in the ordinance, within seven days of passage of the ordinance. Within ten days, the filing officer shall confer with the petitioner concerning form and style of the petition, issue an identification number for the petition, and write a ballot title for the measure. The ballot title shall be posed as a question so that an affirmative answer to the question and an affirmative vote on the measure results in the tax or tax rate increase being imposed and a negative answer to the question and a negative vote on the measure results in the tax or tax rate increase not being imposed. The petitioner shall be notified of the identification number and ballot title within this ten-day period.

After this notification, the petitioner shall have thirty days in which to secure on petition forms the signatures of not less than fifteen percent of the registered voters of the county for county measures, or not less than fifteen percent of the registered voters of the city for city measures, and to file the signed petitions with the filing officer. Each petition form shall contain the ballot title and the full text of the measure to be referred. The filing officer shall verify the sufficiency of the signatures on the petitions. If sufficient valid signatures are properly submitted, the filing officer shall submit the referendum measure to the county or city voters at a general or special election held on one of the dates provided in RCW 29A.04.321 as determined by the county legislative authority or city council, which election shall not take place later than one hundred twenty days after the signed petition has been filed with the filing officer.

After April 22, 1983, the referendum procedure provided in this section shall be the exclusive method for subjecting any county or city ordinance imposing a tax or altering the rate under RCW 82.14.030(2) to a referendum vote.

Any county or city tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(2) that has been imposed prior to April 22, 1983, is not subject to the referendum procedure provided for in this section.

## 82.14.048 - Sales and use taxes for public facilities districts—Definitions.
1. The following definitions apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Distressed public facilities district" means a public facilities district that has defaulted on bond anticipation notes or bonds in excess of forty million dollars on or before April 1, 2012; and

   b. "Anchor jurisdiction" means a city that has entered into an agreement to form a public facilities district under RCW 35.57.010(1)(c) that constitutes a distressed public facilities district under this chapter and in which the largest asset of such public facilities district is located.

2. [Empty]

   a. The governing board of a public facilities district under chapter 36.100 or 35.57 RCW may submit an authorizing proposition to the voters of the district, and if the proposition is approved by a majority of persons voting, impose a sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter.

   b. In addition to the tax authorized pursuant to (a) of this subsection and in addition to any other authority conferred by law, the legislative authority of an anchor jurisdiction may impose a sales and use tax within the geographical boundaries of the anchor jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of this chapter without submitting an authorizing proposition to the voters of the anchor jurisdiction or the distressed public facilities district.

3. The tax authorized in this section is in addition to any other taxes authorized by law and must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the public facilities district. The rate of tax may not exceed two-tenths of one percent of the selling price in the case of a sales tax, or value of the article used, in the case of a use tax. A public facilities district formed under RCW 35.57.010(1)(e) may not impose the tax authorized under this section at a rate that exceeds two-tenths of one percent minus the rate of the highest tax authorized by this section that is imposed by any other public facilities district within its boundaries. An anchor jurisdiction may impose the tax authorized by subsection (2)(b) of this section at a rate not to exceed two-tenths of one percent, regardless of whether any other public facilities district (including a distressed public facilities district) within its boundaries imposes the tax authorized by this section or the rate of such tax imposed by the public facilities district. If a public facilities district formed under RCW 35.57.010(1)(e) has imposed a tax under this section and issued or incurred obligations pledging that tax, so long as those obligations are outstanding no other public facilities district within its boundaries may thereafter impose a tax under this section at a rate that would reduce the rate of the tax that was pledged to the repayment of those obligations. A public facilities district that imposes a tax under this section is responsible for the payment of any costs incurred for the purpose of administering the provisions of this section, RCW 35.57.010(1)(e), and 35.57.020(1)(b), including any administrative costs associated with the imposition of the tax under this section incurred by either the department of revenue or local government, or both.

4. [Empty]

   a. Moneys received by a public facilities district from any tax imposed by the public facilities district under the authority of this section must be used for the purpose of providing funds for the costs associated with the financing, refinancing, design, acquisition, construction, equipping, operating, maintaining, remodeling, repairing, and reequipping of its public facilities.

   b. Moneys received by an anchor jurisdiction from any tax imposed by the anchor jurisdiction under the authority of this section must be used for the purpose of providing funds for the costs associated with the financing, refinancing, design, acquisition, construction, equipping, operating, maintaining, remodeling, repairing, and reequipping of the public facilities of the distressed public facilities district, and for all litigation, investigation, and related costs and expenses incurred by the anchor jurisdiction toward resolving matters related to the defaults of the distressed public facilities district. To the extent the distressed public facilities district owes money to an anchor jurisdiction, the anchor jurisdiction may apply money from the sales tax imposed under this section to any such obligations. Any sales tax imposed by an anchor jurisdiction under this section must terminate no later than thirty years after it is first imposed.

## 82.14.300 - Local government criminal justice assistance—Finding.
The legislature finds and declares that local government criminal justice systems are in need of assistance. Many counties and cities are unable to provide sufficient funding for additional police protection, mitigation of congested court systems, public safety education, and relief of overcrowded jails.

In order to ensure public safety, it is necessary to provide fiscal assistance to help local governments to respond immediately to these criminal justice problems, while initiating a review of the criminal justice needs of cities and counties and the resources available to address those needs.

To provide for a more efficient and effective response to these problems, the legislature encourages cities and counties to coordinate strategies against crime and use multijurisdictional and innovative approaches in addressing criminal justice problems.

## 82.14.310 - County criminal justice assistance account—Transfers from general fund—Distributions based on crime rate and population—Limitations.
1. The county criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the county criminal justice assistance account from the general fund the sum of $23,200,000 divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.

2. The moneys deposited in the county criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under *RCW 82.44.150 and on the relative basis of each county's funding factor as determined under this subsection.

   a. A county's funding factor is the sum of:

      i. The population of the county, divided by 1,000, and multiplied by two-tenths;

      ii. The crime rate of the county, multiplied by three-tenths; and

      iii. The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court, for each 1,000 in population, multiplied by five-tenths.

   b. Under this section and RCW 82.14.320 and 82.14.330:

      i. The population of the county or city is as last determined by the office of financial management;

      ii. The crime rate of the county or city is the annual occurrence of specified criminal offenses, as calculated in the most recent annual report on crime in Washington state as published by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, for each 1,000 in population;

      iii. The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court must be determined by the most recent annual report of the courts of Washington, as published by the administrative office of the courts;

      iv. Distributions and eligibility for distributions in the 1989-1991 biennium must be based on 1988 figures for both the crime rate as described under (b)(ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (b)(iii) of this subsection. Future distributions must be based on the most recent figures for both the crime rate as described under (b)(ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (b)(iii) of this subsection.

3. Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes. Except after May 13, 2021, through December 31, 2023, these funds may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding. Criminal justice purposes are defined as activities that substantially assist the criminal justice system, which may include circumstances where ancillary benefit to the civil or juvenile justice system occurs, and which includes (a) domestic violence services such as those provided by domestic violence programs, community advocates, and legal advocates, as defined in RCW 70.123.020, and (b) during the 2001-2003 fiscal biennium, juvenile dispositional hearings relating to petitions for at-risk youth, truancy, and children in need of services. Existing funding for purposes of this subsection is defined as calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes. Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.

4. Not more than five percent of the funds deposited to the county criminal justice assistance account may be available for appropriations for enhancements to the state patrol crime laboratory system and the continuing costs related to these enhancements. Funds appropriated from this account for such enhancements may not supplant existing funds from the state general fund.

5. Each fiscal biennium, the sum of $510,000, may be appropriated for the Washington state patrol to provide investigative assistance and report services to assist local law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals.

## 82.14.330 - Municipal criminal justice assistance account—Transfers from general fund—Distributions based on crime rate, population, and innovation—Limitations.
1. [Empty]

   a. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the municipal criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section from the general fund the sum of $4,600,000 divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year. The moneys deposited in the municipal criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsection (4) of this section, must be distributed to the cities of the state as follows:

      i. 20 percent appropriated for distribution must be distributed to cities with a three-year average violent crime rate for each 1,000 in population in excess of 150 percent of the statewide three-year average violent crime rate for each 1,000 in population. The three-year average violent crime rate must be calculated using the violent crime rates for each of the preceding three years from the annual reports on crime in Washington state as published by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs. Moneys must be distributed under this subsection (1)(a) ratably based on population as last determined by the office of financial management, but no city may receive more than one dollar per capita. Moneys remaining undistributed under this subsection at the end of each calendar year must be distributed to the criminal justice training commission to reimburse participating city law enforcement agencies with 10 or fewer full-time commissioned patrol officers the cost of temporary replacement of each officer who is enrolled in basic law enforcement training, as provided in RCW 43.101.200.

      ii. 16 percent must be distributed to cities ratably based on population as last determined by the office of financial management, but no city may receive less than $1,000.

   b. The moneys deposited in the municipal criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this subsection (1) must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under *RCW 82.44.150.

   c. Moneys distributed under this subsection (1) must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes. Except after May 13, 2021, through December 31, 2023, these funds may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding. Criminal justice purposes are defined as activities that substantially assist the criminal justice system, which may include circumstances where ancillary benefit to the civil justice system occurs, and which includes domestic violence services such as those provided by domestic violence programs, community advocates, and legal advocates, as defined in RCW 70.123.020. Existing funding for purposes of this subsection is defined as calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes. Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.

2. [Empty]

   a. In addition to the distributions under subsection (1) of this section:

      i. 10 percent must be distributed on a per capita basis to cities that contract with another governmental agency for the majority of the city's law enforcement services. Cities that subsequently qualify for this distribution must notify the department of commerce by November 30th for the upcoming calendar year. The department of commerce must provide a list of eligible cities to the state treasurer by December 31st. The state treasurer must modify the distribution of these funds in the following year. Cities have the responsibility to notify the department of commerce of any changes regarding these contractual relationships. Adjustments in the distribution formula to add or delete cities may be made only for the upcoming calendar year; no adjustments may be made retroactively.

      ii. The remaining 54 percent must be distributed to cities and towns by the state treasurer on a per capita basis. These funds must be used for: (A) Innovative law enforcement strategies; (B) programs to help at-risk children or child abuse victim response programs; and (C) programs designed to reduce the level of domestic violence or to provide counseling for domestic violence victims.

   b. The moneys deposited in the municipal criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this subsection (2), less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsection (4) of this section, must be distributed at the times as distributions are made under *RCW 82.44.150. Moneys remaining undistributed under this subsection at the end of each calendar year must be distributed to the criminal justice training commission to reimburse participating city law enforcement agencies with 10 or fewer full-time commissioned patrol officers the cost of temporary replacement of each officer who is enrolled in basic law enforcement training, as provided in RCW 43.101.200.

   c. If a city is found by the state auditor to have expended funds received under this subsection (2) in a manner that does not comply with the criteria under which the moneys were received, the city is ineligible to receive future distributions under this subsection (2) until the use of the moneys are justified to the satisfaction of the director or are repaid to the state general fund.

3. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the distributions to any city that substantially decriminalizes or repeals its criminal code after July 1, 1990, and that does not reimburse the county for costs associated with criminal cases under RCW 3.50.800 or 3.50.805(2), must be made to the county in which the city is located.

4. Not more than five percent of the funds deposited to the municipal criminal justice assistance account may be available for appropriations for enhancements to the state patrol crime laboratory system and the continuing costs related to these enhancements. Funds appropriated from this account for such enhancements may not supplant existing funds from the state general fund.

5. During the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, the amount that would otherwise be transferred into the municipal criminal justice assistance account from the general fund under subsection (1) of this section must be reduced by 3.4 percent.

   a. The governing body of a public facilities district imposing a sales and use tax under the authority of this section may increase the rate of tax up to 0.037 percent if, within three fiscal years of July 1, 2008, the department determines that, as a result of RCW 82.14.490 and the chapter 6, Laws of 2007 amendments to RCW 82.14.020, a public facilities district's sales and use tax collections for fiscal years after July 1, 2008, have been reduced by a net loss of at least 0.50 percent from the fiscal year before July 1, 2008. The fiscal year in which this section becomes effective is the first fiscal year after July 1, 2008.

   b. The department must determine sales and use tax collection net losses under this section as provided in *RCW 82.14.500 (2) and (3).

   c. A public facilities district may increase its rate of tax after it has received written notice from the department as provided in (b) of this subsection. The increase in the rate of tax must be made in 0.001 percent increments and must be the least amount necessary to mitigate the net loss in sales and use tax collections as a result of RCW 82.14.490 and the chapter 6, Laws of 2007 amendments to RCW 82.14.020. The increase in the rate of tax is subject to RCW 82.14.055.

3. The tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section must be deducted from the amount of tax otherwise required to be collected or paid over to the department of revenue under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW. The department of revenue must perform the collection of such taxes on behalf of the county at no cost to the public facilities district. During the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, distributions by the state to a public facilities district based on the additional rate authorized in subsection (2) of this section must be reduced by 3.4 percent.

4. No tax may be collected under this section before August 1, 2000. The tax imposed in this section expires when bonds issued to finance or refinance the construction, improvement, rehabilitation, or expansion of the regional center and related parking facilities are retired, but not more than forty years after the tax is first collected.

5. Moneys collected under this section may only be used for the purposes set forth in RCW 35.57.020 and must be matched with an amount from other public or private sources equal to thirty-three percent of the amount collected under this section; however, amounts generated from nonvoter approved taxes authorized under chapter 35.57 RCW or nonvoter approved taxes authorized under chapter 36.100 RCW do not constitute a public or private source.

6. The combined total tax levied under this section may not be greater than 0.037 percent. If both a public facilities district created under chapter 35.57 RCW and a public facilities district created under chapter 36.100 RCW impose a tax under this section, the tax imposed by a public facilities district created under chapter 35.57 RCW must be credited against the tax imposed by a public facilities district created under chapter 36.100 RCW.

7. A public facilities district created under chapter 36.100 RCW is not eligible to impose the tax under this section if the legislative authority of the county where the public facilities district is located has imposed a sales and use tax under RCW 82.14.0485 or 82.14.0494.

The rate of tax may not exceed the rate provided in RCW 82.08.020(1) in the case of a sales tax or a use tax, less the aggregate rates of any other taxes imposed on the same events that are credited against the state taxes imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW. The tax rate may be no higher than what is reasonably necessary for the local government to receive its entire annual state contribution in a ten-month period of time.

2. The tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section must be deducted from the amount of tax otherwise required to be collected or paid over to the department under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW. The department must perform the collection of such taxes on behalf of the city, town, or county at no cost to the city, town, or county.

3. No tax may be imposed under this section before July 1, 2007. Before imposing a tax under this section, the city, town, or county shall first have received tax allocation revenues during the preceding calendar year. The tax imposed under this section expires on the earlier of the date: (a) The tax allocation revenues are no longer used for public improvements and public improvement costs; (b) the bonds issued to finance or refinance the improvements are no longer outstanding, if the bonds are issued; or (c) that is thirty years after the tax is first imposed.

      ii. The amount of tax distributions totals the amount of local public sources, dedicated in the previous calendar year to finance public improvements authorized under chapter 39.100 RCW, expended in the previous year for public improvement costs, or used to pay for other bonds issued to pay for public improvements. Revenues from local public sources, including hospital sources identified in RCW 82.14.465(7)(k), dedicated in the preceding calendar year that are in excess of the project award may be carried forward and used in later years for the purpose of this subsection; or

      iii. The amount of revenue from taxes imposed under this section by all cities, towns, and counties totals the annual state credit limit as provided in RCW 82.32.700(3);

   d. The tax must be distributed again, should it cease to be distributed for any of the reasons provided in (c) of this subsection, at the beginning of the next fiscal year, subject to the restrictions in this section; and

   e. Any revenue generated by the tax in excess of the amounts specified in (b) and (c) of this subsection belong to the state of Washington.

5. If both a county and a city or town impose a tax under this section, the tax imposed by the city, town, or county is credited as follows:

   a. If the county has created a benefit zone before the city or town, the tax imposed by the county is credited against the tax imposed by the city or town, the purpose of such credit is to give priority to the county tax; and

   b. If the city or town has created a benefit zone before the county, the tax imposed by the city or town is credited against the tax imposed by the county, the purpose of such credit is to give priority to the city or town tax.

6. The department must determine the amount of tax distributions attributable to each city, town, and county imposing a sales and use tax under this section and must advise a city, town, or county when the tax will cease to be distributed for the remainder of the fiscal year as provided in subsection (4)(c) of this section. Determinations by the department of the amount of taxes attributable to a city, town, or county are final and may not be used to challenge the validity of any tax imposed under this section. The department must remit any tax revenues in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (4)(b) and (c) of this section to the state treasurer who must deposit the moneys in the general fund.

7. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section and RCW 82.14.470 unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

However, if a local government creates the benefit zone and reasonably determines that no activity subject to tax under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW occurred in the twelve months immediately preceding the creation of the benefit zone within the boundaries of the area that became the benefit zone, "excess state excise taxes" means the entire amount of state excise taxes the state receives during a calendar year period beginning with the calendar year immediately following the creation of the benefit zone and continuing with each measurement year thereafter.

   e. "State excise taxes" means revenues derived from state retail sales and use taxes under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW, less the amount of tax distributions from all local retail sales and use taxes imposed on the same taxable events that are credited against the state retail sales and use taxes under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW except for the local tax authorized in this section.

   f. "Fiscal year" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 39.100.030.

   g. "Measurement year" means a calendar year, beginning with the calendar year following the base year and each calendar year thereafter, that is used annually to measure the amount of excess state excise taxes and excess local excise taxes.

   h. "State contribution" means the lesser of two million dollars or an amount equal to excess state excise taxes received by the state during the preceding calendar year.

The department's determination of the amount of the state contribution is final and conclusive, and may not be changed once such determination is made and such contribution is distributed to the sponsoring or cosponsoring local government, unless the department subsequently determines that local revenue information contained in a report described in RCW 39.102.140 differs from the actual dedicated local revenue. If a discrepancy is found, the department must adjust its determination accordingly. A sponsoring or cosponsoring local government may not receive, in any fiscal year, more revenues from taxes imposed under the authority of this section than the amount approved annually by the department.

16. The tax imposed under the authority of this section must cease to be imposed if the sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government fails to commence construction on public improvements by June 30, 2017.
