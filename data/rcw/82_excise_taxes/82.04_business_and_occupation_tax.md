The term does not include services such as engineering, architectural, surveying, flagging, accounting, legal, consulting, land development or management, or administrative services provided to the consumer of, or person responsible for performing, the constructing, building, repairing, improving, or decorating services.

2. A contract or agreement under which a person is responsible for both services that would otherwise be subject to tax as a service under RCW 82.04.290(2) and also constructing, building, repairing, improving, or decorating activities that would otherwise be subject to tax under another section of this chapter is subject to the tax that applies to the predominant activity under the contract or agreement.

3. Unless otherwise provided by law, a contract or agreement under which a person is responsible for activities that are subject to tax as a service under RCW 82.04.290(2), and a subsequent contract or agreement under which the same person is responsible for constructing, building, repairing, improving, or decorating activities subject to tax under another section of this chapter, shall not be combined and taxed as a single activity if at the time of the first contract or agreement it was not contemplated by the parties, as evidenced by the facts, that the same person would be awarded both contracts.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Land development or management" means site identification, zoning, permitting, and other preconstruction regulatory services provided to the consumer of the constructing, building, repairing, improving, or decorating services.

## 82.04.263 - Tax on cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development.
1. Upon every person engaging within this state in the business of cleaning up for the United States, or its instrumentalities, radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of 0.471 percent.

2. For the purposes of this chapter, "cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development" means:

   a. The activities of handling, storing, treating, immobilizing, stabilizing, or disposing of radioactive waste, radioactive tank waste and capsules, nonradioactive hazardous solid and liquid wastes, or spent nuclear fuel;

   b. Spent nuclear fuel conditioning;

   c. Removal of contamination in soils and groundwater;

   d. Decontamination and decommissioning of facilities; and

   e. Services supporting the performance of cleanup. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), a service supports the performance of cleanup if it:

      i. Is within the scope of work under a clean-up contract with the United States department of energy; or

      ii. Assists in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy under a subcontract entered into with the prime contractor or another subcontractor in furtherance of a clean-up contract between the United States department of energy and a prime contractor.

3. A service does not assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy if the same services are routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities, except that the following services are always deemed to contribute to the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy:

   a. Information technology and computer support services;

   b. Services rendered in respect to infrastructure; and

   c. Security, safety, and health services.

4. The legislature intends that the examples provided in this subsection be used as a guideline when determining whether a service is "routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities" as that phrase is used in subsection (3) of this section.

   a. The radioactive waste clean-up classification does not apply to general accounting services but does apply to performance audits performed for persons cleaning up radioactive waste.

   b. The radioactive waste clean-up classification does not apply to general legal services but does apply to those legal services that assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy. Thus, legal services provided to contest any local, state, or federal tax liability or to defend a company against a workers' compensation claim arising from a worksite injury do not qualify for the radioactive waste clean-up classification. But, legal services related to the resolution of a contractual dispute between the parties to a clean-up contract between the United States department of energy and a prime contractor do qualify.

   c. General office janitorial services do not qualify for the radioactive waste clean-up classification, but the specialized cleaning of equipment exposed to radioactive waste does qualify.

## 82.04.4451 - Credit against tax due—Maximum credit—Table.
1. In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed against the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter, as provided in this section. Except for taxpayers that report at least 50 percent of their taxable amount under RCW 82.04.255, 82.04.290(2)(a), and 82.04.285, the maximum credit for a taxpayer for a reporting period is $55 multiplied by the number of months in the reporting period, as determined under RCW 82.32.045. For a taxpayer that reports at least 50 percent of its taxable amount under RCW 82.04.255, 82.04.290(2)(a), and 82.04.285, the maximum credit for a reporting period is $160 multiplied by the number of months in the reporting period, as determined under RCW 82.32.045.

2. When the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter is equal to or less than the maximum credit, a credit is allowed equal to the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter.

3. When the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter exceeds the maximum credit, a reduced credit is allowed equal to twice the maximum credit, minus the tax otherwise due under this chapter, but not less than zero.

4. The department may prepare a tax credit table consisting of tax ranges using increments of no more than five dollars and a corresponding tax credit to be applied to those tax ranges. The table shall be prepared in such a manner that no taxpayer will owe a greater amount of tax by using the table than would be owed by performing the calculation under subsections (1) through (3) of this section. A table prepared by the department under this subsection must be used by all taxpayers in taking the credit provided in this section.

## 82.04.447 - Credit—Natural or manufactured gas purchased by direct service industrial customers—Reports.
1. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

   a. "Direct service industrial customer" means a person who is an industrial customer that contracts for the purchase of power from the Bonneville Power Administration for direct consumption as of May 8, 2001. "Direct service industrial customer" includes a person who is a subsidiary that is more than fifty percent owned by a direct service industrial customer and who receives power from the Bonneville Power Administration pursuant to the parent's contract for power.

   b. "Facility" means a gas turbine electrical generation facility that does not exist on May 8, 2001, and is owned by a direct service industrial customer for the purpose of producing electricity to be consumed by the direct service industrial customer.

   c. "Average annual employment" means the total employment in this state for a calendar year at the direct service industrial customer's location where electricity from the facility will be consumed.

2. Effective July 1, 2001, a credit is allowed against the tax due under this chapter to a direct service industrial customer who purchases natural or manufactured gas from a gas distribution business subject to the public utility tax under chapter 82.16 RCW. The credit is equal to the value of natural or manufactured gas purchased from a gas distribution business and used to generate electricity at the facility multiplied by the rate in effect for the public utility tax on gas distribution businesses under RCW 82.16.020. This credit may be used each reporting period for sixty months following the first month natural or manufactured gas was purchased from a gas distribution business by a direct service industrial customer who constructs a facility.

3. Application for credit shall be made by the direct service industrial consumer before the first purchase of natural or manufactured gas. The application shall be in a form and manner prescribed by the department and shall include but is not limited to information regarding the location of the facility, the projected date of first purchase of natural or manufactured gas to generate electricity at the facility, the date construction is projected to begin or did begin, the applicant's average annual employment in the state for the six calendar years immediately preceding the year in which the application is made, and affirm the applicant's status as a direct service industrial customer. The department shall rule on the application within thirty days of receipt.

4. Credit under this section is limited to the amount of tax imposed under this chapter. Refunds shall not be given in place of credits and credits may not be carried over to subsequent calendar years.

5. All or part of the credit shall be disallowed and must be paid if the average of the direct service industrial customer's average annual employment for the five calendar years subsequent to the calendar year containing the first month of purchase of natural or manufactured gas to generate electricity at a facility is less than the six-year average annual employment stated on the application for credit under this section. The direct service industrial customer will certify to the department by June 1st of the sixth calendar year following the calendar year in which the month of first purchase of gas occurs the average annual employment for each of the five prior calendar years. All or part of the credit that shall be disallowed and must be paid is commensurate with the decrease in the five-year average of average annual employment as follows:

   c. Interest shall not be charged on the credit that is disallowed for the sixty-month period the credit may be taken, although all other penalties and interest applicable to delinquent excise taxes may be assessed and imposed. The debt for credit that is disallowed and must be paid will not be extinguished by insolvency or other failure of the direct service industrial customer. Transfer of ownership of the facility does not affect eligibility for this credit. However, the credit is available to the successor only if the eligibility conditions of this section are met.

7. The employment security department shall make, and certify to the department of revenue, all determinations of employment under this section as requested by the department.

8. A person claiming this credit shall supply to the department quarterly reports containing information necessary to document the total volume of natural or manufactured gas purchased in the quarter, the value of that total volume, and the percentage of the total volume used to generate electricity at the facility.

## 82.04.448 - Credit—Manufacturing semiconductor materials. (Contingent effective date; contingent expiration date.)
1. Subject to the limits and provisions of this section, a credit is authorized against the tax otherwise due under RCW 82.04.240(2) for persons engaged in the business of manufacturing semiconductor materials. For the purposes of this section "semiconductor materials" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 82.04.240(2).

2. [Empty]

   a. The credit under this section equals three thousand dollars for each employment position used in manufacturing production that takes place in a new building exempt from sales and use tax under RCW 82.08.965 and 82.12.965. A credit is earned for the calendar year a person fills a position. Additionally a credit is earned for each year the position is maintained over the subsequent consecutive years, up to eight years. Those positions that are not filled for the entire year are eligible for fifty percent of the credit if filled less than six months, and the entire credit if filled more than six months.

   b. To qualify for the credit, the manufacturing activity of the person must be conducted at a new building that qualifies for the exemption from sales and use tax under RCW 82.08.965 and 82.12.965.

   c. In those situations where a production building in existence on *the effective date of this section will be phased out of operation, during which time employment at the new building at the same site is increased, the person is eligible for credit for employment at the existing building and new building, with the limitation that the combined eligible employment not exceed full employment at the new building. "Full employment" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.08.965. The credit may not be earned until the commencement of commercial production, as that term is used in RCW 82.08.965.

3. No application is necessary for the tax credit. The person is subject to all of the requirements of chapter 82.32 RCW. In no case may a credit earned during one calendar year be carried over to be credited against taxes incurred in a subsequent calendar year. No refunds may be granted for credits under this section.

4. If at any time the department finds that a person is not eligible for tax credit under this section, the amount of taxes for which a credit has been claimed is immediately due. The department must assess interest, but not penalties, on the taxes for which the person is not eligible. The interest must be assessed at the rate provided for delinquent excise taxes under chapter 82.32 RCW, is retroactive to the date the tax credit was taken, and accrues until the taxes for which a credit has been used are repaid.

5. A person claiming the credit under this section must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.

6. Credits may be claimed after the expiration date of this section, for those buildings at which commercial production began before the expiration date of this section, subject to all of the eligibility criteria and limitations of this section.

7. This section expires January 1, 2024, unless the contingency in RCW 82.32.790(2) occurs.

Supp. 1941 § 8370-8a; \]

## 82.04.462 - Apportionable income.
1. The apportionable income of a person within the scope of RCW 82.04.460(1) is apportioned to Washington by multiplying its apportionable income by the receipts factor. Persons who are subject to tax under more than one of the tax classifications enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (x) must calculate a separate receipts factor for each tax classification that the person is taxable under.

2. For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the receipts factor is a fraction and is calculated as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section and, for financial institutions, as provided in the rule adopted by the department under the authority of RCW 82.04.460(2).

3. [Empty]

   a. The numerator of the receipts factor is the total gross income of the business of the taxpayer attributable to this state during the tax year from engaging in an apportionable activity. The denominator of the receipts factor is the total gross income of the business of the taxpayer from engaging in an apportionable activity everywhere in the world during the tax year.

   b. Except as otherwise provided in this section, for purposes of computing the receipts factor, gross income of the business generated from each apportionable activity is attributable to the state:

      i. Where the customer received the benefit of the taxpayer's service or, in the case of gross income from royalties, where the customer used the taxpayer's intangible property. When a customer receives the benefit of the taxpayer's services or uses the taxpayer's intangible property in this and one or more other states and the amount of gross income of the business that was received by the taxpayer in return for the services received or intangible property used by the customer in this state can be reasonably determined by the taxpayer, such amount of gross income must be attributed to this state.

      ii. If the customer received the benefit of the service or used the intangible property in more than one state and if the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state in which the benefit of the service was primarily received or in which the intangible property was primarily used.

      iii. If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i) or (ii) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state from which the customer ordered the service or, in the case of royalties, the office of the customer from which the royalty agreement with the taxpayer was negotiated.

      iv. If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state to which the billing statements or invoices are sent to the customer by the taxpayer.

      v. If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state from which the customer sends payment to the taxpayer.

      vi. If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state where the customer is located as indicated by the customer's address: (A) Shown in the taxpayer's business records maintained in the regular course of business; or (B) obtained during consummation of the sale or the negotiation of the contract for services or for the use of the taxpayer's intangible property, including any address of a customer's payment instrument when readily available to the taxpayer and no other address is available.

      vii. If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), or (vi) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the commercial domicile of the taxpayer.

      viii. For purposes of this subsection (3)(b), "customer" means a person or entity to whom the taxpayer makes a sale or renders services or from whom the taxpayer otherwise receives gross income of the business. "Customer" includes anyone who pays royalties or charges in the nature of royalties for the use of the taxpayer's intangible property.

   c. Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the receipts factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in this state, and the gross income is attributable under (b) of this subsection (3) to a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (3)(c), "not taxable" means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that state, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a state in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with that state under the standards in RCW 82.04.067(1) regardless of whether that state imposes such a tax. "Business activities tax" means a tax measured by the amount of, or economic results of, business activity conducted in a state. The term includes taxes measured in whole or in part on net income or gross income or receipts. "Business activities tax" does not include a sales tax, use tax, or a similar transaction tax, imposed on the sale or acquisition of goods or services, whether or not denominated a gross receipts tax or a tax imposed on the privilege of doing business.

   d. This subsection (3) does not apply to financial institutions with respect to apportionable income taxable under RCW 82.04.290. Financial institutions must calculate the receipts factor as provided in subsection (4) of this section and the rule adopted by the department under the authority of RCW 82.04.460(2) with respect to apportionable income taxable under RCW 82.04.290. Financial institutions that are subject to tax under any other tax classification enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (v) and (vii) through (x) must calculate a separate receipts factor, as provided in this section, for each of the other tax classifications that the financial institution is taxable under.

4. A taxpayer may calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year based on the most recent calendar year for which information is available for the full calendar year. If a taxpayer does not calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year based on previous calendar year information as authorized in this subsection, the business must use current year information to calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year. In either case, a taxpayer must correct the reporting for the current tax year when complete information is available to calculate the receipts factor for that year, but not later than October 31st of the following tax year. Interest will apply to any additional tax due on a corrected tax return. Interest must be computed and assessed as provided in RCW 82.32.050 and accrues until the additional taxes are paid. Penalties as provided in RCW 82.32.090 will apply to any such additional tax due only if the current tax year reporting is not corrected and the additional tax is not paid by October 31st of the following tax year. Interest as provided in RCW 82.32.060 will apply to any tax paid in excess of that properly due on a return as a result of a taxpayer using previous calendar year data or incomplete current-year data to calculate the receipts factor.

5. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

   a. "Apportionable activities" and "apportionable income" have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.460.

   b. "State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any foreign country or political subdivision of a foreign country.

## 82.04.470 - Wholesale sale—Reseller permit—Exemption certificates—Burden of proof—Tax liability.
1. The burden of proving that a sale is a wholesale sale rather than a retail sale is on the seller. A seller may meet its burden of proving a sale is a wholesale sale rather than a retail sale by taking from the buyer, at the time of sale or within a reasonable time after the sale as provided by rule of the department, a copy of a reseller permit issued to the buyer by the department under RCW 82.32.780 or 82.32.783.

2. [Empty]

   a. In lieu of a copy of a reseller permit issued by the department, a seller may accept from a buyer that is required to be registered with the department under RCW 82.32.030:

      i. A properly completed uniform exemption certificate approved by the streamlined sales and use tax agreement governing board; or

      ii. Any other exemption certificate as may be authorized by the department and properly completed by the buyer.

   b. Certificates authorized under (a)(i) and (ii) of this subsection (2) must include the reseller permit number issued by the department to the buyer.

   c. A seller who accepts exemption certificates authorized in (a) of this subsection (2) is not required to verify with the department whether the buyer is required to be registered with the department under RCW 82.32.030. Nothing in this subsection (2)(c) may be construed to modify any of the provisions of RCW 82.08.050.

3. [Empty]

   a. In lieu of a copy of a reseller permit issued by the department, a seller may accept from a buyer that is not required to be registered with the department under RCW 82.32.030:

4. In lieu of obtaining the documentation in subsection (1), (2), or (3) of this section, a seller may capture the relevant data elements as allowed under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement.

5. A seller that does not comply with subsection (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section may meet its burden of proving that a sale is a wholesale sale rather than a retail sale by demonstrating facts and circumstances, according to rules adopted by the department, that show the sale was properly made without payment of retail sales tax.

6. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, a seller who maintains records establishing that it uses electronic means to verify, at least once per calendar year, the validity of its customers' reseller permits need not take a copy of a reseller permit or other documentation or the data elements as authorized in subsection (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section for wholesale sales to those customers with valid reseller permits as confirmed by the department for all sales occurring within twelve months following the date that the seller last electronically verified the validity of its customers' reseller permits. A seller that meets the requirements of this subsection will be deemed to have met its burden of proving a sale is a wholesale sale rather than a retail sale.

7. As used in this section "reseller permit" means documentation issued by the department under RCW 82.32.780 or 82.32.783, which is used to substantiate a wholesale sale.

2. The tax paid by the courtesy dealer on behalf of the selling dealer shall constitute a debt from the selling dealer to the courtesy dealer, and the courtesy dealer is authorized to withhold payment to the selling dealer out of the proceeds of the sale an amount equal to the tax imposed by this chapter. Amounts withheld by the courtesy dealer are deemed to be held in trust by the courtesy dealer until paid to the department, and any courtesy dealer who appropriates or converts the amount withheld to the courtesy dealer's own use or to any use other than the payment of the tax to the extent that the money withheld is not available for payment on the due date is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

Secs. 116 through 126.

2. A mobile telecommunications service provider may elect to calculate gross proceeds of sales by including all charges for mobile telecommunications services provided to all consumers, whether the consumers are the mobile telecommunications service provider's customers or not, if the services originate from or are received on telecommunications equipment or apparatus in this state and are billed to a person in this state.

3. If a mobile telecommunications service provider elects to be taxed under subsection (2) of this section, the mobile telecommunications service provider must provide written notice of the election before August 1, 2002, or before the beginning date of any tax year thereafter in which it wishes to change its reporting and make this election.

      i. For the coemployment of covered employees; and

      ii. For the allocation of employer rights and obligations between the client and the professional employer organization with respect to the covered employees.

However, property is no longer in the process of import transportation when the property is:

   a. Put to actual use in any state, territory, or possession of the United States for any purpose;
