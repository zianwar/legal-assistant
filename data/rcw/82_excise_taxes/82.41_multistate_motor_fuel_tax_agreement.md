## 82.41.010 - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to simplify the confusing, unnecessarily duplicative, and burdensome motor fuel use tax licensing, reporting, and remittance requirements imposed on motor carriers involved in interstate commerce by authorizing the state of Washington to participate in a multistate motor fuel tax agreement for the administration, collection, and enforcement of those states' motor fuel use taxes.
