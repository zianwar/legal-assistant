Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, all employers of members of retirement systems administered by the department shall transmit by a warrant or check to the department within fifteen days following the end of each calendar month the moneys due the department as determined by the statutes governing each system together with such reports as the department may require. The director may collect interest on any employer's overdue payments at the rate of one percent per month on the outstanding balance where necessary to secure adherence to timeliness requirements.

## 41.50.125 - Interest on contributions—Department may charge.
The department may charge interest, as determined by the director, on member or employer contributions owing to any of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030. The department's authority to charge interest shall extend to all optional and mandatory billings for contributions where member or employer contributions are paid other than immediately after service is rendered. Except as explicitly limited by statute, the director may delay the imposition of interest charges on late contributions under this section if the delay is necessary to implement required changes in the department's accounting and information systems.

## 41.50.130 - Correction of retirement systems' records—Adjustment in payment of benefits—Limitations.
1. The director may at any time correct errors appearing in the records of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030. Should any error in such records result in any member, beneficiary, or other person or entity receiving more or less than he or she would have been entitled to had the records been correct, the director, subject to the conditions set forth in this section, shall adjust the payment in such a manner that the benefit to which such member, beneficiary, or other person or entity was correctly entitled shall be paid in accordance with the following:

   a. In the case of underpayments to a member or beneficiary, the retirement system shall correct all future payments from the point of error detection, and shall compute the additional payment due for the allowable prior period which shall be paid in a lump sum by the appropriate retirement system.

   b. In the case of overpayments to a retiree or other beneficiary, the retirement system shall adjust the payment so that the retiree or beneficiary receives the benefit to which he or she is correctly entitled. The retiree or beneficiary shall either repay the overpayment in a lump sum within ninety days of notification or, if he or she is entitled to a continuing benefit, elect to have that benefit actuarially reduced by an amount equal to the overpayment. The retiree or beneficiary is not responsible for repaying the overpayment if the employer is liable under RCW 41.50.139.

   c. In the case of overpayments to a person or entity other than a member or beneficiary, the overpayment shall constitute a debt from the person or entity to the department, recovery of which shall not be barred by laches or statute of limitations.

2. Except in the case of actual fraud, in the case of overpayments to a member or beneficiary, the benefits shall be adjusted to reflect only the amount of overpayments made within three years of discovery of the error, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in chapter 4.16 RCW.

3. Except in the case of actual fraud, no monthly benefit shall be reduced by more than fifty percent of the member's or beneficiary's corrected benefit. Any overpayment not recovered due to the inability to actuarially reduce a member's benefit due to: (a) The provisions of this subsection; or (b) the fact that the retiree's monthly retirement allowance is less than the monthly payment required to effectuate an actuarial reduction, shall constitute a claim against the estate of a member, beneficiary, or other person or entity in receipt of an overpayment.

4. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, obligations of employers or members until paid to the department shall constitute a debt from the employer or member to the department, recovery of which shall not be barred by laches or statutes of limitation.

## 41.50.131 - Correction of errors in reporting compensation earnable.
1. Notwithstanding RCW 41.50.130, the department is not required to correct, nor to cause any employer to correct the reporting error described in subsection (2) of this section.

2. Standby pay and other similar forms of compensation that are not pay for time worked were not salary or wages for personal services within the meaning of RCW 41.40.010(8). Contrary to RCW 41.40.010(8), some employers have been reporting standby pay to the department as compensation earnable. To avoid unduly impacting the retirement allowances of persons who have retired on or before June 9, 1994, the department is not required to correct, nor cause to be corrected, any misreporting of amounts identified as standby pay through June 9, 1994. Any erroneous reporting of amounts identified as standby pay to the department on or after June 9, 1994, shall be corrected as an error under RCW 41.50.130.

3. The forgiveness of past misreporting under subsection (2) of this section constitutes a benefit enhancement for those individuals for whom amounts received as standby pay were misreported to the department. Prior to June 9, 1994, no retirement system member had any right, contractual or otherwise, to have amounts identified as standby pay included as compensation earnable.

\[ [1994 c 177 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2644-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%20177%20§%209); \]

## 41.50.132 - Correction of erroneous deduction or pickup of contributions.
1. By December 31, 1992, the department of retirement systems shall implement and complete the following process for those members of the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 2, public employees' retirement system plans 1 and 2, and teachers' retirement system plan 2 who erroneously had contributions either deducted or picked-up from their earnings on and after January 1, 1987:

   a. Create a list of transactions by employer for those members whose employer either deducted or picked-up employee contributions during a month where an employee did not work sufficient hours to earn service credit;

   b. Provide the affected employers with direction and guidance for the review of the transmitted lists from this subsection and the employers' preparation of any necessary correcting transactions to the department's records;

   c. Receive all correcting transactions submitted by the employer.

2. All debits and credits to all member accounts affected by this remedial process shall be reconciled by the department.

3. All moneys payable to an affected member, or any moneys to be further deducted or picked-up from such member's earnings, shall be determined and accomplished solely by the employer.

4. After December 31, 1992, no credit of employer contributions shall be made.

5. Return of contributions to an employee by the department is limited solely to when such member retires or otherwise terminates his or her membership and chooses to withdraw them with any accumulated interest.

6. Employer contributions forfeited under this section shall be transferred to the department of retirement systems expense account.

\[ [1991 c 343 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1268-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20343%20§%2013); \]

## 41.50.133 - Recovery of certain overpayments to surviving beneficiaries under the teachers' retirement system.
1. The director of the department of retirement systems shall not recover from surviving beneficiaries of members who died in service any pension overpayment based on the application of section 2, chapter 96, Laws of 1979 ex. sess., nor shall such benefits be reduced.

2. The director of the department of retirement systems shall not recover from retirees any pension overpayments made between July 1, 1990, and February 1, 1992, based upon the application of *RCW 41.40.198, 41.40.1981, 41.40.325, 41.32.485, 41.32.487, or 41.32.575 due to the incorrect calculation of the "age sixty-five allowance" as this term is defined in *RCW 41.32.575(1)(a) and 41.40.325(1)(a).

\[ [1992 c 212 § 21](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2259.SL.pdf?cite=1992%20c%20212%20§%2021); [1987 c 490 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c490.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20490%20§%202); \]

## 41.50.135 - Collection of overpayments—Determination of liability—Administrative process created.
1. If the department finds that any member, beneficiary, or other person or entity has been paid an amount of retirement benefits to which that person or entity is not entitled, and the person is not entitled to a continuing benefit from any of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030, the department may issue an order and notice of assessment specifying the amount due, including interest, to be remitted to the department. The order and notice of assessment shall be served upon any person or entity who may have received benefits to which the person or entity is not entitled. The order and notice of assessment shall be served by the department in the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action, or by certified mail to the last known address of the obligor as shown by the records of the department.

2. Any notice of assessment under subsection (1) of this section shall constitute a determination of liability from which the member, beneficiary, or other person or entity served may appeal by filing a petition for adjudicative proceedings with the director personally or by mail within sixty days from the date the assessment was served. If a petition for adjudicative proceedings is not filed within sixty days of the delivery of the notice of assessment, the determination that was the basis for establishing the overpayment debt and the assessment is conclusive and final.

3. This section creates an administrative process for the collection of overpayments from persons who are not entitled to a continuing benefit from one of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030. The collection of overpayments from persons entitled to a continuing benefit from one of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030 is governed by RCW 41.50.130.

\[ [1996 c 56 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6198-S.SL.pdf?cite=1996%20c%2056%20§%201); \]

## 41.50.136 - Collection of overpayments—Issuance of warrant—Lien.
Whenever a notice of determination of liability becomes conclusive and final under RCW 41.50.135, the director, upon giving at least twenty days notice by certified mail return receipt requested to the individual's last known address of the intended action, may file with the superior court clerk of any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the notice of determination of liability plus a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10). The clerk of the county where the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for the warrant, and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the person mentioned in the warrant, the amount of the notice of determination of liability, and the date when the warrant was filed. The amount of the warrant as docketed shall become a lien upon the title to, and any interest in, all real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case duly docketed in the office of such clerk. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed to the person mentioned in the warrant by certified mail to the person's last known address within five days of its filing with the clerk.

## 41.50.137 - Collection of overpayments—Department may issue subpoenas.
The department may issue subpoenas to compel the statement of witnesses and the production of any books, records, or documents necessary or relevant to the department's administration of duties under this chapter. It is unlawful for any person or entity, without just cause, to fail to comply with any subpoena issued under this section.

\[ [1996 c 56 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6198-S.SL.pdf?cite=1996%20c%2056%20§%203); \]

## 41.50.138 - Collection of overpayments—Waiver of overpayment.
1. The director may waive repayment of all or part of a retirement allowance overpayment, under RCW 41.50.130 only, if:

   a. The overpayment was not the result of the retiree's or the beneficiary's nondisclosure, fraud, misrepresentation, or other fault; and

   b. The director finds in his or her sole discretion that recovery of the overpayment would be a manifest injustice.

2. The director may not waive an overpayment if the member, retiree, or beneficiary:

   a. Provided incorrect information to the department or the employer which caused the overpayment;

   b. Failed to provide information to the department or the employer which was necessary to correctly calculate the retirement allowance;

   c. Caused the employer to provide incorrect information or fail to provide necessary information; or

   d. Knew or reasonably should have known that he or she was in receipt of an overpayment.

3. If the director waives an overpayment and the overpayment occurred because the member's or retiree's employer:

   a. Provided incorrect information to the department which caused the overpayment;

   b. Failed to provide information to the department which was necessary to correctly calculate the retirement allowance;

   c. Caused another party to provide incorrect information or fail to provide necessary information; or

   d. Knew or reasonably should have known that the information provided would cause the retiree or beneficiary to be overpaid;

then the department shall bill the member's or retiree's employer for the amount of the overpayment that would have been recoverable under RCW 41.50.130 had the overpayment not been waived pursuant to this section.

4. Nothing in this section authorizes the director to waive the prospective correction of an overstated retirement allowance.

5. If the director waives an overpayment he or she must state in writing:

   a. The nature of and reason for the overpayment;

   b. The reason for the waiver; and

   c. The amount of the overpayment that is waived.

The department will maintain a file containing documentation of all overpayments waived. The department will provide the file to any person upon request.

6. This section applies to overpayments identified on or after September 1, 1994.

\[ [1996 c 56 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6198-S.SL.pdf?cite=1996%20c%2056%20§%204); \]

## 41.50.139 - Retirement status reports—Overpayments—Employer obligations.
1. Retirement system employers shall elicit on a written form from all new employees as to their having been retired from a retirement system listed in RCW 41.50.030. Employers must report any retirees in their employ to the department. If a retiree works in excess of applicable postretirement employment restrictions and the employer failed to report the employment of the retiree, that employer is liable for the loss to the trust fund.

2. If an employer erroneously reports to the department that an employee has separated from service such that a person receives a retirement allowance in contravention of the applicable retirement system statutes, the person's retirement status shall remain unaffected and the employer is liable for the resulting overpayments.

3. Upon receipt of a billing from the department, the employer shall pay into the appropriate retirement system trust fund the amount of the overpayment plus interest as determined by the director. The employer's liability under this section shall not exceed the amount of overpayments plus interest received by the retiree within three years of the date of discovery, except in the case of fraud. In the case of fraud, the employer is liable for the entire overpayment plus interest.

\[ [1997 c 254 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5218-S.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20254%20§%2016); \]

## 41.50.140 - Cooperation of employers in administration of systems—Employer contributions for retroactive service credit—Employee contributions paid by employer.
1. Every employer participating in one or more of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030 shall fully cooperate in the administration of the systems in which its employees participate, including the distribution of information to employees, and shall accept and carry out all other duties as required by law, regulation, or administrative instruction.

2. If an employee is entitled to retroactive service credit which was not previously established through no fault of the employee, or through an employer error which has caused a member's compensation or contributions to be understated or overstated so as to cause a loss to the retirement funds, the director may bill the employer for the loss, to include interest, if applicable. The employer contributions, with interest thereon, will be treated as if in fact the interest was part of the normal employer contribution and no distribution of interest received shall be required.

3. Employer-paid employee contributions will not be credited to a member's account until the employer notifies the director in writing that the employer has been reimbursed by the employee or beneficiary for the payment. The employer shall have the right to collect from the employee the amount of the employee's obligation. Failure on the part of the employer to collect all or any part of the sums which may be due from the employee or beneficiary shall in no way cause the employer obligation for the total liability to be lessened.

\[ [1982 1st ex.s. c 52 § 33](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c52.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2052%20§%2033); \]

## 41.50.145 - Plan 3—Loss of investment return due to error—Liability.
1. If the department determines that due to employer error a member of plan 3 has suffered a loss of investment return, the employer shall pay the department for credit to the member's account the amount determined by the department as necessary to correct the error.

2. If the department determines that due to departmental error a member of plan 3 has suffered a loss of investment return, the department shall credit to the member's account from the appropriate retirement system combined plan 2 and 3 fund the amount determined by the department as necessary to correct the error.

## 41.50.150 - Retirement benefits based on excess compensation—Employer liable for extra retirement costs.
1. The employer of any employee whose retirement benefits are based in part on excess compensation, as defined in this section, shall, upon receipt of a billing from the department, pay into the appropriate retirement system the present value at the time of the employee's retirement of the total estimated cost of all present and future benefits from the retirement system attributable to the excess compensation. The state actuary shall determine the estimated cost using the same method and procedure as is used in preparing fiscal note costs for the legislature. However, the director may in the director's discretion decline to bill the employer if the amount due is less than fifty dollars. Accounts unsettled within thirty days of the receipt of the billing shall be assessed an interest penalty of one percent of the amount due for each month or fraction thereof beyond the original thirty-day period.

2. "Excess compensation," as used in this section, includes the following payments, if used in the calculation of the employee's retirement allowance:

   a. A cash out of unused annual leave in excess of two hundred forty hours of such leave. "Cash out" for purposes of this subsection means:

      i. Any payment in lieu of an accrual of annual leave; or

      ii. Any payment added to salary or wages, concurrent with a reduction of annual leave;

   b. A cash out of any other form of leave;

   c. A payment for, or in lieu of, any personal expense or transportation allowance to the extent that payment qualifies as reportable compensation in the member's retirement system;

   d. The portion of any payment, including overtime payments, that exceeds twice the regular daily or hourly rate of pay; and

   e. Any termination or severance payment.

3. This section applies to the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030 and to retirements occurring on or after March 15, 1984. Nothing in this section is intended to amend or determine the meaning of any definition in chapter 2.10, 2.12, 41.26, 41.32, 41.40, 41.35, 41.37, or 43.43 RCW or to determine in any manner what payments are includable in the calculation of a retirement allowance under such chapters.

4. An employer is not relieved of liability under this section because of the death of any person either before or after the billing from the department.

## 41.50.152 - Payment of excess compensation—Public notice requirements.
1. Except as limited by subsection (3) of this section, the governing body of an employer under chapter 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, or 41.40 RCW shall comply with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section prior to executing a contract or collective bargaining agreement with members under chapter 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, or 41.40 RCW which provides for:

   a. A cash out of unused annual leave in excess of two hundred forty hours of such leave. "Cash out" for purposes of this subsection means any payment in lieu of an accrual of annual leave or any payment added to regular salary, concurrent with a reduction of annual leave;

   c. A payment for, or in lieu of, any personal expense or transportation allowance;

   d. The portion of any payment, including overtime payments, that exceeds twice the regular rate of pay; or

   e. Any other termination or severance payment.

2. Any governing body entering into a contract that includes a compensation provision listed in subsection (1) of this section shall do so only after public notice in compliance with the open public meetings act, chapter 42.30 RCW. This notification requirement may be accomplished as part of the approval process for adopting a contract in whole, and does not require separate or additional open public meetings. At the public meeting, full disclosure shall be made of the nature of the proposed compensation provision, and the employer's estimate of the excess compensation billings under RCW 41.50.150 that the employing entity would have to pay as a result of the proposed compensation provision. The employer shall notify the department of its compliance with this section at the time the department bills the employer under RCW 41.50.150 for the pension impact of compensation provisions listed in subsection (1) of this section that are adopted after July 23, 1995.

3. The requirements of subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to the adoption of a compensation provision listed in subsection (1) of this section if the compensation would not be includable in calculating benefits under chapter 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, or 41.40 RCW for the employees covered by the compensation provision.

1. If a person receives a withdrawal of accumulated contributions from any of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030 in contravention of the restrictions on withdrawal for the particular system, the member shall no longer be entitled to credit for the period of service represented by the withdrawn contributions. The erroneous withdrawal shall be treated as an authorized withdrawal, subject to all conditions imposed by the member's system for restoration of withdrawn contributions. Failure to restore the contributions within the time permitted by the system shall constitute a waiver by the member of any right to receive a retirement allowance based upon the period of service represented by the withdrawn contributions.

2. All erroneous withdrawals occurring prior to June 9, 1994, shall be subject to the provisions of this section. The deadline for restoring the prior erroneous withdrawals shall be five years from June 9, 1994, for members who are currently active members of a system.

## 41.50.160 - Restoration of withdrawn contributions.
The department of retirement systems shall incorporate the development of individual member accounts receivable into its information systems projects for fiscal years 1993 and 1994, so that by January 1, 1994, members of state retirement systems who are otherwise eligible to restore previously withdrawn contributions have the option to make restoration in a manner determined by the department.

   a. Must provide any data and assistance requested by the department to facilitate the transition of responsibility for making benefit payments to higher education retirement plan members eligible for supplemental benefit payments; and

   b. Is governed by the provisions of RCW 41.50.110.

3. On the date that the department assumes responsibility for benefit payments under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall assess contributions to the department of retirement systems expense fund under RCW 41.50.110(3) for active participants in the higher education retirement plan. Contributions to the expense fund for higher education retirement plan members must end when there are no longer retirees or beneficiaries from an institution receiving payments administered by the department.

   a. Upon the department's assumption of responsibility for making benefit payments from an institution's higher education retirement plan, the institution shall submit to the department the benefit level for current higher education retirement plan supplemental beneficiaries, and each month following the department's assumption of responsibility for making benefit payments to an institution's higher education retirement plan supplemental beneficiaries, the institution shall submit to the department information on any new retirees covered by the higher education retirement plan supplemental benefit. The submission shall include all data relevant to the calculation of a supplemental benefit for each retiree, and the benefit that the institution determines the individual qualifies to receive. No later than January 1st, following the funding determination in RCW 41.45.060(9) that begins the transition of responsibility for benefit payments to the department, the department shall provide the institution with a notice of what data will be required to determine higher education retirement plan supplemental benefit determinations for future retirees.

   b. The department shall review the information provided by the institution for each retiring higher education retirement plan member eligible for the supplemental benefit and determine the supplemental benefit amount the member is eligible to receive, if any.

   c.

2. [Empty]

   a.

The withheld amount shall be delivered to the clerk of the court that issued the mandatory benefits assignment order each month, but the first delivery shall occur no sooner than twenty days after receipt of the mandatory benefits assignment order.

   b. The department shall continue to withhold the ordered amount from nonexempt benefits of the obligor until notified by the court that the mandatory benefits assignment order has been modified or terminated. If the department is initially unable to comply, or able to comply only partially, with the withholding obligation, the court's order shall be interpreted to require the department to comply to the greatest extent possible at the earliest possible date. The department shall notify the court of changes in withholding amounts and the reason for the change. When the obligor is no longer eligible to receive funds from one or more public retirement systems the department shall promptly notify the court.

   b. If the department is unable to comply fully with the withholding obligation, the court's order shall be interpreted to require the department to comply to the greatest extent possible.

6. If the department, without good cause, fails to withhold funds as required by a mandatory benefits assignment order issued under RCW 41.50.570, the department may be held liable to the obligee for any amounts wrongfully disbursed to the obligor in violation of the mandatory benefits assignment order. However, the department shall under no circumstances be held liable for failing to withhold funds from a withdrawal of accumulated contributions unless the mandatory benefits assignment order was properly served on the department at least thirty days before the department made the withdrawal payment to the obligor. If the department is held liable to an obligee for failing to withhold funds as required by a mandatory benefits assignment order, the department may recover such amounts paid to an obligee by thereafter either withholding such amounts from the available nonexempt benefits of the obligor or filing a legal action against the obligor.

7. If the department complies with a court order pursuant to RCW 41.50.500 through 41.50.650, neither the department, its officers, its employees, nor any of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030 may be liable to the obligor or an obligee for wrongful withholding.

8. The department may combine amounts withheld from various obligors into a single payment to the superior court clerk, if the payment includes a listing of the amounts attributable to each obligor and other information as required by the clerk.

9. The department shall mail to the obligor at the obligor's last known mailing address appearing in the department's files copies of the mandatory benefits assignment order and the department's answer within twenty days after receiving the mandatory benefits assignment order.

10. The department shall not consider any withholding allowance that is elective to the employee to be a mandatory deduction for purposes of calculating the member's disposable benefits subject to a mandatory benefits assignment order. The department shall withhold elective withholdings as elected by the employee after deducting from the benefit the amount owing to an obligee pursuant to a mandatory benefits assignment order.

## 41.50.620 - Mandatory assignment of retirement benefits—Order—Service.
1. Service of the mandatory benefits assignment order on the department is invalid unless it is served with four answer forms in conformance with RCW 41.50.610, together with stamped envelopes addressed to, respectively, the clerk of the court where the order was issued, the obligee's attorney or the obligee, and the obligor at the last mailing address known to the obligee. The obligee shall also include an extra copy of the mandatory benefits assignment order for the department to mail to the obligor. Service on the department shall be in person or by any form of mail requiring a return receipt.

2. On or before the date of service of the mandatory benefits assignment order on the department, the obligee shall mail or cause to be mailed by certified or registered mail a copy of the mandatory benefits assignment order to the obligor at the obligor's last mailing address known to the obligee; or, in the alternative, a copy of the mandatory benefits assignment order shall be served on the obligor in the same manner as a summons in a civil action on, before, or within two days after the date of service of the order on the department. This requirement is not jurisdictional, but if the copy is not mailed or served as this subsection requires, or if any irregularity appears with respect to the mailing or service, the superior court, in its discretion, may quash the mandatory benefits assignment order, upon motion of the obligor promptly made and supported by an affidavit showing that the obligor has been prejudiced due to the failure to mail or serve the copy.

\[ [1991 c 365 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1211-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20365%20§%2010); [1987 c 326 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c326.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20326%20§%2013); \]

## 41.50.630 - Mandatory assignment of retirement benefits—Hearing to quash, modify, or terminate order.
In a hearing to quash, modify, or terminate the mandatory benefits assignment order, the court may grant relief only upon a showing that the mandatory benefits assignment order causes extreme hardship or substantial injustice. Satisfaction by the obligor of all past due payments subsequent to the issuance of the mandatory benefits assignment order is not grounds to quash, modify, or terminate the mandatory benefits assignment order. If a mandatory benefits assignment order has been in operation for twelve consecutive months and the obligor's spousal maintenance is current, the court may terminate the order upon motion of the obligor unless the obligee can show good cause as to why the mandatory benefits assignment order should remain in effect.

\[ [1991 c 365 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1211-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20365%20§%2011); [1987 c 326 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c326.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20326%20§%2014); \]

An obligor shall not be considered a prevailing party under this section unless the obligee has acted in bad faith in connection with the proceeding in question. This section does not authorize an award of attorneys' fees against the department of retirement systems or any of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030.

2. The department of retirement systems shall notify a spouse or ex spouse who, pursuant to a mandatory benefits assignment order entered between July 1, 1987, and July 28, 1991, is receiving benefits in satisfaction of a court-ordered property division, that he or she is entitled to receive direct payments of a court-ordered property division pursuant to RCW 41.50.670 if the dissolution order fully complies or is modified to fully comply with the requirements of RCW 41.50.670 through 41.50.720 and, as applicable, RCW 2.10.180, 2.12.090, * 41.26.180, 41.32.052, 41.40.052, 43.43.310, and 26.09.138.

## 41.50.670 - Property division obligations—Direct payments pursuant to court order.
1. Nothing in this chapter regarding mandatory assignment of benefits to enforce a spousal maintenance obligation shall abridge the right of an obligee to direct payments of retirement benefits to satisfy a property division obligation ordered pursuant to a court decree of dissolution or legal separation or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of dissolution or legal separation as provided in RCW 2.10.180, 2.12.090, 41.26.053, 41.26.162, 41.32.052, 41.35.100, 41.34.070(4), 41.40.052, 43.43.310, 41.37.090, or 26.09.138, as those statutes existed before July 1, 1987, and as those statutes exist on and after July 28, 1991. The department shall pay benefits under this chapter in a lump sum or as a portion of periodic retirement payments as expressly provided by the dissolution order. A dissolution order may not order the department to pay a periodic retirement payment or lump sum unless that payment is specifically authorized under the provisions of chapter 2.10, 2.12, 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.34, 41.40, 41.37, or 43.43 RCW, as applicable.

2. The department shall pay directly to an obligee the amount of periodic retirement payments or lump sum payment, as appropriate, specified in the dissolution order if the dissolution order filed with the department pursuant to subsection (1) of this section includes a provision that states in the following form:

If the obligor's debt is expressed as a percentage of his or her periodic retirement payment and the obligee does not have a survivorship interest in the obligor's benefit, the amount received by the obligee shall be the percentage of the periodic retirement payment that the obligor would have received had he or she selected a standard allowance.

If . . . . . . (the obligor) requests or has requested a withdrawal of accumulated contributions as defined in RCW 41.50.500, or becomes eligible for a lump sum death benefit, the department of retirement systems shall pay to . . . . . . (the obligee) . . . . . . dollars plus interest at the rate paid by the department of retirement systems on member contributions.

4. A court order under this section may not order the department to pay more than seventy-five percent of an obligor's periodic retirement payment to an obligee.

5. Persons whose court decrees were entered between July 1, 1987, and July 28, 1991, shall also be entitled to receive direct payments of retirement benefits to satisfy court-ordered property divisions if the dissolution orders comply or are modified to comply with this section and RCW 41.50.680 through 41.50.720 and, as applicable, RCW 2.10.180, 2.12.090, 41.26.053, 41.32.052, 41.35.100, 41.34.070, 41.40.052, 43.43.310, 41.37.090, and 26.09.138.

6. The obligee must file a copy of the dissolution order with the department within ninety days of that order's entry with the court of record.

7. A division of benefits pursuant to a dissolution order under this section shall be based upon the obligor's gross benefit prior to any deductions. If the department is required to withhold a portion of the member's benefit pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 3402 and the sum of that amount plus the amount owed to the obligee exceeds the total benefit, the department shall satisfy the withholding requirements under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 3402 and then pay the remainder to the obligee. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to amounts withheld pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 3402(i).

## 41.50.700 - Property division obligations—Cessation upon death of obligee or obligor—Payment treated as deduction from member's periodic retirement payment.
1. Except under subsection (3) of this section and RCW 41.26.460(5), 41.32.530(5), 41.32.785(5), 41.32.851(4), 41.35.220(4), 41.40.188(5), 41.40.660(5), 41.40.845(4), 43.43.271(4), and 41.34.080, the department's obligation to provide direct payment of a property division obligation to an obligee under RCW 41.50.670 shall cease upon the death of the obligee or upon the death of the obligor, whichever comes first. However, if an obligor dies and is eligible for a lump sum death benefit, the department shall be obligated to provide direct payment to the obligee of all or a portion of the withdrawal of accumulated contributions pursuant to a court order that complies with RCW 41.50.670.

2. The direct payment of a property division obligation to an obligee under RCW 41.50.670 shall be paid as a deduction from the member's periodic retirement payment. An obligee may not direct the department to withhold any funds from such payment.

3.

2. If the agreement requires additional service and results in payment at the same or a lower rate than that paid for the same or similar service by other employees it may be included in the pension benefit calculation but shall be deemed excess compensation and is billable to the employer as provided in RCW 41.50.150.

3. If the agreement requires additional service and results in payment at a rate higher than that paid for the same or similar service by other employees, that portion of the payment which equals the payment for the same or similar service shall be treated as described in subsection (2) of this section, and the balance of the payment shall be treated as described in subsection (1) of this section.

## 41.50.810 - Blind mailings to retirees—Restrictions.
1. Any organization that exclusively provides representation or services to retired members of the Washington state retirement systems and has membership dues deducted through the department of retirement systems has the right to request the department to assist in doing blind mailings to retirees twice each year. The mailings must provide information to members of the retirement systems eligible for membership in the retiree organization regarding services offered by the retiree organization. The mailings shall not be for the purpose of supporting or opposing any political party, ballot measure, or candidate. The retiree organization must provide all printed materials to be mailed and envelopes to a mail processing center and pay all costs for generating mailing labels, inserting materials into envelopes, sealing, labeling, and delivering materials to be mailed to a bulk mail center or post office. The organization must use its own bulk mail permit and pay all postage costs.

2. The department must provide requested retiree data for addressing the envelopes to the mail center under a secure data share agreement with the mail center under which neither the organizations nor any other entity has direct access to any names or addresses. The department has no obligation to approve or disapprove, or in any other way take any responsibility for, the content of the mailings. Only organizations that meet the requirements under subsection (1) of this section and have legal authority to provide services to retirement system retirees have the right to request assistance with blind mailings.
