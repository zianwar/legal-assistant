## 41.04.208 - Local government retirees—Health care—Definitions—Participation—Exception.
1. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

   a. " Disabled employee" means a person eligible to receive a disability retirement allowance from the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 2 and the public employees' retirement system.

   b. "Health plan" means a contract, policy, fund, trust, or other program established jointly or individually by a county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state that provides for all or a part of hospitalization or medical aid for its employees and their dependents under RCW 41.04.180.

   c. "Retired employee" means a public employee meeting the retirement eligibility, years of service requirements, and other criteria of the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 2 and the public employees' retirement system.

2. A county, municipality, or other political subdivision that provides a health plan for its employees shall permit retired and disabled employees and their dependents to continue participation in a plan subject to the exceptions, limitations, and conditions set forth in this section. However, this section does not apply to a county, municipality, or other political subdivision participating in an insurance program administered under chapter 41.05 RCW if retired and disabled employees and their dependents of the participating county, municipality, or other political subdivision are covered under an insurance program administered under chapter 41.05 RCW. Nothing in this subsection or chapter 319, Laws of 2002 precludes the local government employer from offering retired or disabled employees a health plan with a benefit structure, copayment, deductible, coinsurance, lifetime benefit maximum, and other plan features which differ from those offered through a health plan provided to active employees. Further, nothing in this subsection precludes a local government employer from joining with other public agency employers, including interjurisdictional benefit pools and multi-employer associations or consortiums, to fulfill its obligations under chapter 319, Laws of 2002.

3. A county, municipality, or other political subdivision has full authority to require a person who requests continued participation in a health plan under subsection (2) of this section to pay the full cost of such participation, including any amounts necessary for administration. However, this subsection does not require an employer who is currently paying for all or part of a health plan for its retired and disabled employees to discontinue those payments.

4. Payments for continued participation in a former employer's health plan may be assigned to the underwriter of the health plan from public pension benefits or may be paid to the former employer, as determined by the former employer, so that an underwriter of the health plan that is an insurance company, health care service contractor, or health maintenance organization is not required to accept individual payments from persons continuing participation in the employer's health plan.

5. After an initial open enrollment period of ninety days after January 1, 2003, an employer may not be required to permit a person to continue participation in the health plan if the person is responsible for a lapse in coverage under the plan. In addition, an employer may not be required to permit a person to continue participation in the employer's health plan if the employer offered continued participation in a health plan that meets the requirements of chapter 319, Laws of 2002.

6. If a person continuing participation in the former employer's health plan has medical coverage available through another employer, the medical coverage of the other employer is the primary coverage for purposes of coordination of benefits as provided for in the former employer's health plan.

7. If a person's continued participation in a health plan was permitted because of the person's relationship to a retired or disabled employee of the employer providing the health plan and the retired or disabled employee dies, then that person is permitted to continue participation in the health plan for a period of not more than six months after the death of the retired or disabled employee. However, the employer providing the health plan may permit continued participation beyond that time period.

8. An employer may offer one or more health plans different from that provided for active employees and designed to meet the needs of persons requesting continued participation in the employer's health plan. An employer, in designing or offering continued participation in a health plan, may utilize terms or conditions necessary to administer the plan to the extent the terms and conditions do not conflict with this section.

9. If an employer changes the underwriter of a health plan, the replaced underwriter has no further responsibility or obligation to persons who continued participation in a health plan of the replaced underwriter. However, the employer shall permit those persons to participate in any new health plan.

10. The benefits granted under this section are not considered a matter of contractual right. Should the legislature, a county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state revoke or change any benefits granted under this section, an affected person is not entitled to receive the benefits as a matter of contractual right.

11. This section does not affect any health plan contained in a collective bargaining agreement in existence as of January 1, 2003. However, any plan contained in future collective bargaining agreements shall conform to this section. In addition, this section does not affect any health plan contract or policy in existence as of January 1, 2003. However, any renewal of the contract or policy shall conform to this section.

12. Counties, municipalities, and other political subdivisions that make a documented good faith effort to comply with the provisions of subsections (2) through (11) of this section and are unable to provide access to a fully insured group health benefit plan are discharged from any obligations under subsections (2) through (11) of this section but shall assist disabled employees and retired employees in applying for health insurance. Assistance may include developing and distributing standardized information on the availability and cost of individual health benefit plans, application packages, and health benefit fairs.

13. The office of the insurance commissioner shall make available to counties, municipalities, and other political subdivisions information regarding individual health benefit plans, including a list of carriers offering individual coverage, the rates charged, and how to apply for coverage.

## 41.04.340 - State employee attendance incentive program—Sick leave records to be kept—Remuneration or benefits for unused sick leave—Medical expense plan in lieu of remuneration.
1. An attendance incentive program is established for all eligible employees. As used in this section the term "eligible employee" means any employee of the state, other than eligible employees of the community and technical colleges and the state board for community and technical colleges identified in RCW 28B.50.553, and teaching and research faculty at the state and regional universities and The Evergreen State College, entitled to accumulate sick leave and for whom accurate sick leave records have been maintained. No employee may receive compensation under this section for any portion of sick leave accumulated at a rate in excess of one day per month. The state and regional universities and The Evergreen State College shall maintain complete and accurate sick leave records for all teaching and research faculty.

2. In January of the year following any year in which a minimum of sixty days of sick leave is accrued, and each January thereafter, any eligible employee may receive remuneration for unused sick leave accumulated in the previous year at a rate equal to one day's monetary compensation of the employee for each four full days of accrued sick leave in excess of sixty days. Sick leave for which compensation has been received shall be deducted from accrued sick leave at the rate of four days for every one day's monetary compensation.

From July 1, 2011, through June 29, 2013, the rate of monetary compensation for the purposes of this subsection shall not be reduced by any temporary salary reduction.

3. At the time of separation from state service due to retirement or death, an eligible employee or the employee's estate may elect to receive remuneration at a rate equal to one day's current monetary compensation of the employee for each four full days of accrued sick leave. From July 1, 2011, through June 29, 2013, the rate of monetary compensation for the purposes of this subsection shall not be reduced by any temporary salary reduction.

4. Remuneration or benefits received under this section shall not be included for the purpose of computing a retirement allowance under any public retirement system in this state.

5. Except as provided in subsections (7) through (9) of this section for employees not covered by chapter 41.06 RCW, this section shall be administered, and rules shall be adopted to carry out its purposes, by the director of financial management for persons subject to chapter 41.06 RCW.

6. Should the legislature revoke any remuneration or benefits granted under this section, no affected employee shall be entitled thereafter to receive such benefits as a matter of contractual right.

7. In lieu of remuneration for unused sick leave at retirement as provided in subsection (3) of this section, an agency head or designee may with equivalent funds, provide eligible employees with a benefit plan that provides for reimbursement for medical expenses. This plan shall be implemented only after consultation with affected groups of employees. For eligible employees covered by chapter 41.06 RCW, procedures for the implementation of these plans shall be adopted by the director of the state health care authority. For eligible employees exempt from chapter 41.06 RCW, implementation procedures shall be adopted by an agency head having jurisdiction over the employees.

8. Implementing procedures adopted by the director of the state health care authority or agency heads shall require that each medical expense plan authorized by subsection (7) of this section apply to all eligible employees in any one of the following groups: (a) Employees in an agency; (b) employees in a major organizational subdivision of an agency; (c) employees at a major operating location of an agency; (d) exempt employees under the jurisdiction of an elected or appointed Washington state executive; (e) employees of the Washington state senate; (f) employees of the Washington state house of representatives; (g) classified employees in a bargaining unit established by the public employment relations commission; or (h) other group of employees defined by an agency head that is not designed to provide an individual-employee choice regarding participation in a medical expense plan. However, medical expense plans for eligible employees in any of the groups under (a) through (h) of this subsection who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall be implemented only by written agreement with the bargaining unit's exclusive representative and a separate medical expense plan may be provided for unrepresented employees.

9. Medical expense plans authorized by subsection (7) of this section must require as a condition of participation in the plan that employees in the group affected by the plan sign an agreement with the employer. The agreement must include a provision to hold the employer harmless should the United States government find that the employer or the employee is in debt to the United States as a result of the employee not paying income taxes due on the equivalent funds placed into the plan, or as a result of the employer not withholding or deducting a tax, assessment, or other payment on the funds as required by federal law. The agreement must also include a provision that requires an eligible employee to forfeit remuneration under subsection (3) of this section if the employee belongs to a group that has been designated to participate in the medical expense plan permitted under this section and the employee refuses to execute the required agreement.

## 41.04.385 - Child care—Legislative findings—State policy—Responsibilities of director of enterprise services.
The legislature finds that (1) demographic, economic, and social trends underlie a critical and increasing demand for child care in the state of Washington; (2) working parents and their children benefit when the employees' child care needs have been resolved; (3) the state of Washington should serve as a model employer by creating a supportive atmosphere, to the extent feasible, in which its employees may meet their child care needs; and (4) the state of Washington should encourage the development of partnerships between state agencies, state employees, state employee labor organizations, and private employers to expand the availability of affordable quality child care. The legislature finds further that resolving employee child care concerns not only benefits the employees and their children, but may benefit the employer by reducing absenteeism, increasing employee productivity, improving morale, and enhancing the employer's position in recruiting and retaining employees. Therefore, the legislature declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to assist state employees by creating a supportive atmosphere in which they may meet their child care needs. Policies and procedures for state agencies to address employee child care needs will be the responsibility of the director of enterprise services in consultation with the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families and state employee representatives.

## 41.04.390 - Flexible-time work schedules.
1. The legislature finds that flexible-time work schedules, which provide varying times for employees to arrive at and depart from work, tend to alleviate traffic congestion during peak rush hour periods and thereby reduce hazardous traffic conditions; provide more efficient use of highways and other transit facilities; and decrease fuel consumption. In addition, the legislature finds that flexible-time work schedules provide families in which both parents work outside of the home with the flexibility necessary to provide for day care; provide employees with flexibility allowing them to spend more time with their families; improve employee morale and, in-so-doing, improve productivity. Therefore, due to the clear advantages to both agencies and employees, the legislature finds that flexible-time work schedules should be utilized by agencies to the maximum extent possible.

2. As used in this section, "flexible-time work schedule" means a daily work schedule which contains a core time of required hours during which an employee subject to the schedule is required to be present for work and designated hours before or after the core time during which an employee, with the approval of his or her agency, may elect a time of arrival to work and departure from work.

3. Each agency shall prepare a flexible-time work schedule or schedules and shall offer the schedule or schedules to employees as an option to the traditional eight o'clock a.m. to five o'clock p.m. working day. However, an agency shall not be required to prepare or offer a flexible-time work schedule or schedules if the agency head determines that the implementation of such a schedule would serve as an impediment to the provision of services to the public or would in any other way impede the agency in accomplishing its mission.

4. Any employee wishing to use a flexible-time work schedule prepared under subsection (3) of this section must first obtain the permission of the agency head or the agency head's designee. However, if there is an employee organization certified as an exclusive bargaining representative for a bargaining unit affected by the flexible-time work schedule, the agency shall first negotiate with the certified employee organization.

5. Nothing in this section affects official hours during which state offices are required to be open for the transaction of business, as prescribed in RCW 42.04.060.

\[ [1985 c 411 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c411.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20411%20§%201); \]

## 41.04.400 - Consolidation of local governmental unit and first-class city retirement system—Intent.
It is the purpose of RCW 41.04.405 through 41.04.430 to govern the retirement rights of persons whose employment status is altered when: (1) Two or more units of local government of this state, at least one of which is a first-class city with its own retirement system, enter into an agreement for the consolidated performance of a governmental service, activity, or undertaking; (2) the service, activity, or undertaking is to be performed either by one of the participating local governmental units or by a newly established separate legal entity; and (3) the employees of the participating local governmental units are not all members of the same Washington public retirement system.

RCW 41.04.405 through 41.04.430 are not intended to and do not govern retirement rights of any members of the retirement systems established by chapter 41.16, 41.18, 41.20, or 41.26 RCW, or of employees described in RCW 35.58.265, 35.58.390, or 70.08.070.

\[ [1986 c 225 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c225.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20225%20§%202); \]

## 41.04.585 - Dismissal of municipal employees during World War II—Redress not mandatory.

## 41.04.650 - Leave sharing program—Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that: (1) State employees historically have joined together to help their fellow employees who suffer from, or have relatives or household members suffering from, an extraordinary or severe illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition which prevents the individual from working and causes great economic and emotional distress to the employee and his or her family; (2) state employees have also joined together to help their fellow employees who are sick or temporarily disabled because of pregnancy disability or for the purpose of parental leave to bond with the employee's newborn, adoptive, or foster child; and (3) these circumstances may be exacerbated because the affected employees use all their accrued sick leave and annual leave and are forced to take leave without pay or terminate their employment. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide for the establishment of a leave sharing program.

\[ [2018 c 39 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1434-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%2039%20§%201); [1989 c 93 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c93.pdf?cite=1989%20c%2093%20§%201); \]

The Washington state leave sharing program is hereby created. The purpose of the program is to permit state employees, at no significantly increased cost to the state of providing annual leave, sick leave, or personal holidays, to come to the aid of a fellow state employee who is suffering from or has a relative or household member suffering from an extraordinary or severe illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition; a fellow state employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; a fellow state employee who is sick or temporarily disabled because of pregnancy disability or for the purpose of parental leave; or a fellow state employee who has been called to service in the uniformed services, which has caused or is likely to cause the employee to take leave without pay or terminate his or her employment.

       i. The agency head receives from the affected employee a statement from the employee's doctor verifying that the illness or injury is resolved; or

       ii.

   a. That employees are eligible to participate in the sick leave pool after one year of employment with the state or agency of the state if the employee has accrued a minimum amount of unused sick leave, to be established by rule;

   b. That participation in the sick leave pool shall, at all times, be voluntary on the part of the employees;

   c. That any sick leave pooled shall be removed from the personally accumulated sick leave balance of the employee contributing the leave;

   d. That any sick leave in the pool that is used by a participating employee may be used only for the employee's personal illness, accident, or injury;

   e. That a participating employee is not eligible to use sick leave accumulated in the pool until all of his or her personally accrued sick, annual, and compensatory leave has been used;

   f. A maximum number of days of sick leave in the pool that any one employee may use;

   g. That a participating employee who uses sick leave from the pool is not required to recontribute such sick leave to the pool, except as otherwise provided in this section;

   h. That an employee who cancels his or her membership in the sick leave pool is not eligible to withdraw the days of sick leave contributed by that employee to the pool;

   i. That an employee who transfers from one position in state government to another position in state government may transfer from one pool to another if the eligibility criteria of the pools are comparable and the administrators of the pools have agreed on a formula for transfer of credits;

   j. That alleged abuse of the use of the sick leave pool shall be investigated, and, on a finding of wrongdoing, the employee shall repay all of the sick leave credits drawn from the sick leave pool and shall be subject to such other disciplinary action as is determined by the agency head;

   k. That sick leave credits may be drawn from the sick leave pool by a part-time employee on a pro rata basis; and

   l. That each department or agency shall maintain accurate and reliable records showing the amount of sick leave which has been accumulated and is unused by employees, in accordance with guidelines established by the office of financial management.
