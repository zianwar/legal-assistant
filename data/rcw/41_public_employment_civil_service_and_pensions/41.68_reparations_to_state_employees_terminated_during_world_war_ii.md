## 41.68.010 - Legislative finding.
The dismissal or termination of various state employees during World War II resulted from the promulgation of federal Executive Order 9066 which was based mainly on fear and suspicion rather than on factual justification. It is fair and just that reparations be made to those employees who were terminated from state employment during the wartime years because of these circumstances. The legislature therefore finds that equity and fairness will be served by authorizing the filing of claims with the state for salary losses suffered by the state employees directly affected, and by authorizing the payment thereof, subject to the provisions of this chapter.

\[ [1983 1st ex.s. c 15 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983ex1c15.pdf?cite=1983%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2015%20§%201); \]

## 41.68.020 - Eligibility for reparation.
Any state employee or the living surviving spouse of a state employee who, due to the promulgation of federal Executive Order 9066, was dismissed, terminated from a temporary position, or rejected during the person's probationary period, or who voluntarily resigned in lieu of dismissal from state government employment, and who incurred salary losses as a result thereof, is eligible to file a claim with the state for the reparation of those losses.

## 41.68.030 - Submittal of claim.
A claim under this chapter may be submitted to the department of enterprise services for the reparation of salary losses suffered during the years 1942 through 1947.

For the purposes of this chapter, the terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband, wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family shall be interpreted as applying equally to state registered domestic partnerships or individuals in state registered domestic partnerships as well as to marital relationships and married persons, and references to dissolution of marriage shall apply equally to state registered domestic partnerships that have been terminated, dissolved, or invalidated, to the extent that such interpretation does not conflict with federal law.
