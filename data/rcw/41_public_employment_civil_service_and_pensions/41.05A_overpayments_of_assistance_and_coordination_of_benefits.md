## 41.05A.005 - Purpose—Collaboration with other agencies—Construction.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide the health care authority with the powers, duties, and authority with respect to the collection of overpayments and the coordination of benefits that are currently provided to the department of social and health services in chapter 43.20B RCW. Providing the health care authority with these powers is necessary for the authority to administer medical services programs established under chapter 74.09 RCW currently administered by the department of social and health services programs but transferred to the authority under chapter 15, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess., and programs transferred to the authority under chapter 201, Laws of 2018. The authority is authorized to collaborate with other state agencies in carrying out its duties under this chapter and, to the extent appropriate, may enter into agreements with such other agencies. Nothing in this chapter may be construed as diminishing the powers, duties, and authority granted to the department of social and health services in chapter 43.20B RCW with respect to the programs that will remain under its jurisdiction following enactment of chapter 15, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess. and chapter 201, Laws of 2018.

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 89](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2089); \]

## 41.05A.030 - Fees for services—Reimbursement collection.
The authority is authorized to charge fees for services provided unless otherwise prohibited by law. The fees may be sufficient to cover the full cost of the service provided if practical or may be charged on an ability-to-pay basis if practical. This section does not supersede other statutory authority enabling the assessment of fees by the authority. Whenever the authority is authorized by law to collect total or partial reimbursement for the cost of its providing care of or exercising custody over any person, the authority shall collect the reimbursement to the extent practical. 

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 90](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2090); \]

## 41.05A.040 - Time limit for collection of overpayments or other debts—Write-offs of debts.
1. Except as otherwise provided by law, including subsection (2) of this section, there may be no collection of overpayments and other debts due the authority after the expiration of six years from the date of notice of such overpayment or other debt unless the authority has commenced recovery action in a court of law or unless an administrative remedy authorized by statute is in place. However, any amount due in a case thus extended ceases to be a debt due the authority at the expiration of ten years from the date of the notice of the overpayment or other debt unless a court-ordered remedy would be in effect for a longer period.

2. There may be no collection of debts due the authority after the expiration of twenty years from the date a lien is recorded pursuant to RCW 41.05A.090.

3. The authority, at any time, may accept offers of compromise of disputed claims or may grant partial or total write-off of any debt due the authority if it is no longer cost-effective to pursue. The authority shall adopt rules establishing the considerations to be made in the granting or denial of a partial or total write-off of debts.

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 91](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2091); \]

## 41.05A.060 - Authorization to discharge or compromise lien.
1. No settlement made by and between a recipient and either the tort feasor or insurer, or both, discharges or otherwise compromises the lien created in RCW 41.05A.070 without the express written consent of the director or the director's designee. Discretion to compromise such liens rests solely with the director or the director's designee.

2. No settlement or judgment may be entered purporting to compromise the lien created by RCW 41.05A.070 without the express written consent of the director or the director's designee.

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 93](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2093); \]

## 41.05A.070 - Filing of lien.
1. To secure reimbursement of any assistance paid as a result of injuries to or illness of a recipient caused by the negligence or wrong of another, the authority is subrogated to the recipient's rights against a tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both.

2. The authority has the right to file a lien upon any recovery by or on behalf of the recipient from such tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both, to the extent of the value of the assistance paid by the authority: PROVIDED, That such lien is not effective against recoveries subject to wrongful death when there are surviving dependents of the deceased. The lien becomes effective upon filing with the county auditor in the county where the assistance was authorized or where any action is brought against the tort feasor or insurer. The lien may also be filed in any other county or served upon the recipient in the same manner as a civil summons if, in the authority's discretion, such alternate filing or service is necessary to secure the authority's interest. The additional lien is effective upon filing or service.

3. The lien of the authority may be against any claim, right of action, settlement proceeds, money, or benefits arising from an insurance program to which the recipient might be entitled (a) against the tort feasor or insurer of the tort feasor, or both, and (b) under any contract of insurance purchased by the recipient or by any other person providing coverage for the illness or injuries for which the assistance is paid or provided by the authority.

4. If recovery is made by the authority under this section and the subrogation is fully or partially satisfied through an action brought by or on behalf of the recipient, the amount paid to the authority must bear its proportionate share of attorneys' fees and costs.

   a. The determination of the proportionate share to be borne by the authority must be based upon:

      i. The fees and costs approved by the court in which the action was initiated; or

      ii. The written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs when fees and costs are not addressed by the court.

   b. When fees and costs have been approved by a court, after notice to the authority, the authority has the right to be heard on the matter of attorneys' fees and costs or its proportionate share.

   c. When fees and costs have not been addressed by the court, the authority shall receive at the time of settlement a copy of the written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs and may request and examine documentation of fees and costs associated with the case. The authority may bring an action in superior court to void a settlement if it believes the attorneys' calculation of its proportionate share of fees and costs is inconsistent with the written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs or if the fees and costs associated with the case are exorbitant in relation to cases of a similar nature.

5. The rights and remedies provided to the authority in this section to secure reimbursement for assistance, including the authority's lien and subrogation rights, may be delegated to a managed health care system by contract entered into pursuant to RCW 74.09.522. A managed health care system may enforce all rights and remedies delegated to it by the authority to secure and recover assistance provided under a managed health care system consistent with its agreement with the authority. 

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 94](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2094); \]

## 41.05A.080 - Attorney representing recipient—Duties.
1. An attorney representing a person who, as a result of injuries or illness sustained through the negligence or wrong of another, has received, is receiving, or has applied to receive shall:

   a. Notify the authority at the time of filing any claim against a third party, commencing an action at law, negotiating a settlement, or accepting a settlement offer from the tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both; and

   b. Give the authority thirty days' notice before any judgment, award, or settlement may be satisfied in any action or any claim by the applicant or recipient to recover damages for such injuries or illness.

2. The proceeds from any recovery made pursuant to any action or claim described in RCW 41.05A.070 that is necessary to fully satisfy the authority's lien against recovery must be placed in a trust account or in the registry of the court until the authority's lien is satisfied.

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 95](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2095); \]

## 41.05A.090 - Recovery for assistance by authority—Federal law—Foreclosure—Recipient's death.
1. The authority shall file liens, seek adjustment, or otherwise effect recovery for assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396p. The authority shall adopt a rule providing for prior notice and hearing rights to the record title holder or purchaser under a land sale contract.

2. Liens may be adjusted by foreclosure in accordance with chapter 61.12 RCW.

3. In the case of an individual who was fifty-five years of age or older when the individual received assistance, the authority shall seek adjustment or recovery from the individual's estate, and from nonprobate assets of the individual as defined by RCW 11.02.005, but only for assistance consisting of services that the authority determines to be appropriate, and related hospital and prescription drug services. Recovery from the individual's estate, including foreclosure of liens imposed under this section, must be undertaken as soon as practicable, consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396p.

4. The authority shall apply the assistance estate recovery law as it existed on the date that benefits were received when calculating an estate's liability to reimburse the authority for those benefits.

5. [Empty]

   a. The authority shall establish procedures consistent with standards established by the federal department of health and human services and pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396p to waive recovery when such recovery would work an undue hardship. The authority shall recognize an undue hardship for a surviving domestic partner whenever recovery would not have been permitted if he or she had been a surviving spouse. The authority is not authorized to pursue recovery under such circumstances.

   b. Recovery of assistance from a recipient's estate may not include property made exempt from claims by federal law or treaty, including exemption for tribal artifacts that may be held by individual Native Americans.

6. A lien authorized under this section relates back to attach to any real property that the decedent had an ownership interest in immediately before death and is effective as of that date or date of recording, whichever is earlier.

7. The authority may enforce a lien authorized under this section against a decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in real property held by the decedent immediately prior to his or her death. Such a lien enforced under this subsection may not end and must continue as provided in this subsection until the authority's lien has been satisfied.

   a. The value of the life estate subject to the lien is the value of the decedent's interest in the property subject to the life estate immediately prior to the decedent's death.

   b. The value of the joint tenancy interest subject to the lien is the value of the decedent's fractional interest the recipient would have owned in the jointly held interest in the property had the recipient and the surviving joint tenants held title to the property as tenants in common on the date of the recipient's death.

   c. The authority may not enforce the lien provided by this subsection against a bona fide purchaser or encumbrancer that obtains an interest in the property after the death of the recipient and before the authority records either its lien or the request for notice of transfer or encumbrance as provided by RCW 41.05A.280.

   d. The authority may not enforce a lien provided by this subsection against any property right that vested prior to July 1, 2005.

8. [Empty]

   a. Subject to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396p(a) and the conditions of this subsection (8), the authority is authorized to file a lien against the property of an individual prior to his or her death, and to seek adjustment and recovery from the individual's estate or sale of the property subject to the lien, if:

      i. The individual is an inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities, or other medical institution; and

      ii. The authority has determined after notice and opportunity for a hearing that the individual cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged from the medical institution and to return home.

   b. If the individual is discharged from the medical facility and returns home, the authority shall dissolve the lien.

9. The authority is authorized to adopt rules to effect recovery under this section. The authority may adopt by rule later enactments of the federal laws referenced in this section.

10. It is the responsibility of the authority to fully disclose in advance verbally and in writing, in easy to understand language, the terms and conditions of estate recovery to all persons offered care subject to recovery of payments.

11. In disclosing estate recovery costs to potential clients, and to family members at the consent of the client, the authority shall provide a written description of the community service options.

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 96](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2096); \]

## 41.05A.100 - Lien against real and personal property—Lien priority—Recovery by deduction or withholding of payments—Civil action.
1. Overpayments of assistance become a lien against the real and personal property of the recipient from the time of filing by the authority with the county auditor of the county in which the recipient resides or owns property, and the lien claim has preference over the claims of all unsecured creditors.

2. Debts due the state for overpayments of assistance may be recovered by the state by deduction from the subsequent assistance payments to such persons, lien and foreclosure, or order to withhold and deliver, or may be recovered by civil action.

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 97](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2097); \]

## 41.05A.110 - Notice of overpayment of assistance.
1. Any person who owes a debt to the state for an overpayment of assistance must be notified of that debt by either personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested. Personal service, return of the requested receipt, or refusal by the debtor of such notice is proof of notice to the debtor of the debt owed. Service of the notice must be in the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action. The notice must include a statement of the debt owed; a statement that the property of the debtor will be subject to collection action after the debtor terminates from assistance; a statement that the property will be subject to lien and foreclosure, distraint, seizure and sale, or order to withhold and deliver; and a statement that the net proceeds will be applied to the satisfaction of the overpayment debt. Action to collect the debt by lien and foreclosure, distraint, seizure and sale, or order to withhold and deliver, is lawful after ninety days from the debtor's termination from assistance or the receipt of the notice of debt, whichever is later. This does not preclude the authority from recovering overpayments by deduction from subsequent assistance payments, not exceeding deductions as authorized under federal law with regard to financial assistance programs: PROVIDED, That subject to federal legal requirement, deductions may not exceed five percent of the grant payment standard if the overpayment resulted from error on the part of the authority or error on the part of the recipient without willful or knowing intent of the recipient in obtaining or retaining the overpayment.

2. A current or former recipient who is aggrieved by a claim that he or she owes a debt for an overpayment of assistance has the right to an adjudicative proceeding pursuant to RCW 74.09.741. If no application is filed, the debt is subject to collection action as authorized under this chapter. If a timely application is filed, the execution of collection action on the debt is stayed pending the final adjudicative order or termination of the debtor from assistance, whichever occurs later.

\[ [2011 1st sp.s. c 15 § 98](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1738-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%201st%20sp.s.%20c%2015%20§%2098); \]

## 41.05A.120 - Order to withhold and deliver.
1. After service of a notice of debt for an overpayment as provided for in RCW 41.05A.110, stating the debt accrued, the director may issue to any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state an order to withhold and deliver property of any kind including, but not restricted to, earnings which are due, owing, or belonging to the debtor, when the director has reason to believe that there is in the possession of such person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state property which is due, owing, or belonging to the debtor. The order to withhold and deliver must state the amount of the debt, and must state in summary the terms of this section, RCW 6.27.150 and 6.27.160, chapters 6.13 and 6.15 RCW, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1673, and other state or federal exemption laws applicable generally to debtors. The order to withhold and deliver must be served in the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state upon whom service has been made shall answer the order to withhold and deliver within twenty days, exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of therein. The director may require further and additional answers to be completed by the person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state. If any such person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state possesses any property which may be subject to the claim of the authority, such property must be withheld immediately upon receipt of the order to withhold and deliver and must, after the twenty-day period, upon demand, be delivered forthwith to the director. The director shall hold the property in trust for application on the indebtedness involved or for return, without interest, in accordance with final determination of liability or nonliability. In the alternative, there may be furnished to the director a good and sufficient bond, satisfactory to the director, conditioned upon final determination of liability. Where money is due and owing under any contract of employment, express or implied, or is held by any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state subject to withdrawal by the debtor, such money must be delivered by remittance payable to the order of the director. Delivery to the director, subject to the exemptions under RCW 6.27.150 and 6.27.160, chapters 6.13 and 6.15 RCW, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1673, and other state or federal law applicable generally to debtors, of the money or other property held or claimed satisfies the requirement of the order to withhold and deliver. Delivery to the director serves as full acquittance, and the state warrants and represents that it shall defend and hold harmless for such actions persons delivering money or property to the director pursuant to this chapter. The state also warrants and represents that it shall defend and hold harmless for such actions persons withholding money or property pursuant to this chapter.

2. The director shall also, on or before the date of service of the order to withhold and deliver, mail or cause to be mailed by certified mail a copy of the order to withhold and deliver to the debtor at the debtor's last known post office address or, in the alternative, a copy of the order to withhold and deliver must be served on the debtor in the same manner as a summons in a civil action on or before the date of service of the order or within two days thereafter. The copy of the order must be mailed or served together with a concise explanation of the right to petition for a hearing on any issue related to the collection. This requirement is not jurisdictional, but, if the copy is not mailed or served as provided in this section, or if any irregularity appears with respect to the mailing or service, the superior court, on its discretion on motion of the debtor promptly made and supported by affidavit showing that the debtor has suffered substantial injury due to the failure to mail the copy, may set aside the order to withhold and deliver and award to the debtor an amount equal to the damages resulting from the director's failure to serve on or mail to the debtor the copy.
