   d. An equitable share of the administrative costs, all of which costs are to be paid by the cities;

   e. An equitable share of the cost of the death-in-the-line-of-duty benefit, all of which costs are to be paid by the cities.

Any city having in its employ ten or more employees who are members of the system may elect to contribute, in lieu of its contributions set forth in item (a) above, an amount estimated actuarially necessary to match at retirement the accumulated normal contributions of those of its members who will ultimately retire for service or disability; provided that such election shall be made by resolution or ordinance of the legislative body of such city and, in order to become effective for the remainder of the year 1953, shall be made on or before July 1, 1953, and thereafter any election so made shall be made prior to January 1, 1954, to become then effective or prior to January 1st of any succeeding year to become effective on January 1st of such succeeding year.

Any city may, with the approval of the board, further elect to contribute in lieu of its contributions set forth in items (b) and (c) above, an amount estimated actuarially, necessary to amortize over a period of not to exceed thirty years, all liabilities on account of the participation of such a city, which are not covered by the contributions of its employees, its funds on hand and its contributions provided for in item (a) above or the contributions elected to be made in lieu thereof in cases where such city shall have elected to make said contribution in lieu of the contributions required in said item (a); provided that such election shall be made by resolution or ordinance of the legislative body of such city and, in order to become effective for the remainder of the year 1953, shall be made on or before July 1, 1953, and thereafter any election so made shall be made prior to January 1, 1954, to become then effective or prior to January 1st of any succeeding year to become effective on January 1st of such succeeding year.

In the event that any city shall be making either of the lieu contributions as hereinabove set forth, the resulting contributions shall be adjusted to conform with facts and conditions disclosed by each succeeding actuarial valuation.

2. Payment of the obligation set forth in subsection (1) of this section may be made in advance or may be paid currently as contributions are received from employees and pensions are paid to retired members: PROVIDED, That the share of administrative expense and expense of the death-in-the-line-of-duty benefits shall be paid as soon as funds are available to make such payment and the board shall have the right to require any city that has withdrawn from the system, to annually, at the beginning of each calendar year, deposit and pay in cash an amount estimated by the board to be sufficient to meet the obligation of such city for the ensuing year to those of its members receiving a retirement allowance. From time to time each city may apply reserves in payment of the obligations set forth above as contemplated in RCW 41.44.200.

3. The board shall furnish each city with an estimate of the amount necessary to pay the obligations of the city in the ensuing fiscal year and the city shall provide therefor in its budget.

The board shall furnish each city with a monthly statement of the amount of matching contributions, prior service charges and charges for minimum retirement allowances properly accruing by reason of payment of retirement allowances and deposit of contributions of members.

4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the retirement system shall not be liable for the payment of any retirement allowances or other benefits on account of the employees or retired members of any city under this chapter, for which reserves or guarantees have not been properly set up by such city or its employees to pay such retirement allowances or other benefits: PROVIDED, That nothing herein contained shall be so construed to prevent the establishment of a reserve account for annuities and pensions in which shall be placed at the time of retirement of any member the balances of the retiring member's contribution and the city's matching funds for such member and from which account all annuities and current service pensions shall be paid.

5. Any city may, by majority vote of its electors, withdraw from participation in the retirement system two years after giving written notice to the board of such action by the electorate. It is hereby specifically provided, however, that the city's obligation to those members receiving or eligible to a retirement allowance prior to such termination of participation shall continue in full force and effect as provided in this chapter.

2. The board of trustees shall be the custodian of the retirement fund and shall arrange for the safekeeping thereof. Subject to such provisions as may be prescribed by law for the deposit of city funds in banks, cash belonging to the retirement fund may be deposited in any licensed national bank or banks in the state, or in any bank, banks or corporations authorized or licensed to do a banking business and organized under the laws of the state of Washington; and may be withdrawn on order of the board for the purpose of making such payments as are authorized and required by this chapter.

3. The board may invest pension fund moneys in such securities of the United States, states, Dominion of Canada, public housing authorities, municipal corporations and other public bodies, as are designated by the laws of the state as lawful investments for the funds of mutual savings banks, and to invest not to exceed twenty-five percent of the system's total investments in the securities of any corporations or public utility bodies as are designated by the laws of the state as lawful investments for the funds of mutual savings banks: PROVIDED, That not more than five percent of the system's total investments may be made in the securities of any one of such corporations or public utility bodies.

4. Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided, investment of pension funds may also be made in amounts not to exceed twenty-five percent of the system's total investments in the shares of certain open-end investment companies: PROVIDED, That not more than five percent of the system's total investments may be made in the shares of any one such open-end investment company. The total amount invested in any one company shall not exceed five percent of the assets of such company, and shall only be made in the shares of such companies as are registered as "open-end companies" under the federal investment company act of 1940, as amended. Such company must be at least ten years old and have net assets of at least five million dollars. It must have no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness, or any stock having priority over the shares being purchased, either as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.

Investment of pension funds may also be made in the bonds of any municipal corporation or other public body of the state; and in any of the bonds or warrants, including local improvement bonds or warrants within the protection of the local improvement guaranty fund law, issued by any city or town which is a member of the system. Investment of pension funds may also be made in the bonds or other obligations of any other state or territory of the United States or of any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality of any such state, territory, or political subdivision thereof.

Investment of pension funds may also be made in bonds or other obligations insured or guaranteed or which are covered by a repurchase agreement in whole or in part by the federal government or through any corporation, administrator, agency or instrumentality which is or hereafter may be created by the federal government.

6. In order to provide for an equitable apportionment of the cost of the making and handling of the system's investments, the board may charge against the annual earnings from the system's investments, including income from the same and gains realized from the purchase and sale of its securities, a portion of such earnings computed on the book value of the investments held by the system at the end of its fiscal year, for the purpose of paying the cost of purchasing, safekeeping, servicing and handling its securities: PROVIDED, That such portion shall not exceed one-half of one percent of such value and shall not exceed the net gain from the operations for the year: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such charge shall not be considered as an administrative expense payable solely by the cities.

## 41.44.130 - Contributions by employees.
1. The normal rates of contribution of members shall be based on sex and age at time of entry into the system, which age shall be the age at the birthday nearest the date of such entry.

2. The normal rates of contribution for miscellaneous personnel shall be so fixed as to provide an annuity which, together with the pension provided by the city, shall produce as nearly as may be, a retirement allowance at the age of sixty-two years, of one and one-third percent of the final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service of the retiring employee. The normal rate established for age sixty shall be the rate for any member who has attained a greater age before entrance into the retirement system and the normal contribution established for age twenty-four shall be the rate for any member who enters the system at an earlier age.

3. The normal rates of contribution for uniformed personnel shall be so fixed as to provide an annuity which, together with the pension that would be derived from equal contributions by the city, shall produce as nearly as may be for members who enter service at age thirty-seven or below, a retirement allowance, at age fifty-five with twenty-five or more years of service, or at an age greater than fifty-five after twenty-five years of service, equal to fifty percent of final compensation; and for members entering service at ages over thirty-seven, a retirement allowance at age sixty-two which shall be the same proportion of fifty percent of final compensation as the member's actual years credited bear to twenty-five years. The normal rate established for age fifty shall be the rate for any member who has attained a greater age before entrance into the retirement system.

4. Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the board shall adopt rules and regulations governing the making of deductions from the compensation of employees and shall certify to the proper officials in each city the normal rate of contribution for each member provided for in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. The proper officials in each city shall apply such rate of contribution to the full compensation of uniformed personnel and to so much of the compensation of miscellaneous personnel as does not exceed three hundred dollars per month, or four hundred dollars per month, or to any increased amount of such compensation as to members whose member cities have duly elected to increase the limitation provided for in subsection (12) of RCW 41.44.030 and shall certify to the board on each and every payroll the total amount to be contributed and shall furnish immediately to the board a copy of each and every payroll; and each of said amounts shall be forwarded immediately to the board and the board shall credit the deduction shown on such payroll to individual accounts of the members represented on such payrolls.

5. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the contribution made and provided for herein, and shall receipt in full for his or her salary or compensation. Payment less said contributions shall be a full and complete discharge of all claims and demands whatsoever for the service rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except his or her claim to the benefits to which he or she may be entitled under the provisions of this chapter.

6. Any member may elect to contribute in excess of the contributions provided for in this section in accordance with rules to be established by the board for the purpose of providing additional benefits, but the exercise of this privilege shall not place on the member city or cities any additional financial obligation.

## 41.44.180 - Examination of disability beneficiary—Reentry.
1. The board may, at its pleasure, require any disability beneficiary under age sixty-two in the miscellaneous personnel and under age fifty-five in the uniformed personnel to undergo medical examination by medical authority designated by the board. Upon the basis of such examination the board shall determine whether such disability beneficiary is still totally and permanently incapacitated, either physically or mentally, for service in the office or department of the city where he or she was employed or in any other position in that city, the duties of which he or she might reasonably be expected to carry out.

2. If the board shall determine that the beneficiary is not so incapacitated his or her retirement allowance shall be canceled and he or she shall be reinstated forthwith in city service. If the city is unable to find employment for a disability beneficiary found to be no longer totally and permanently disabled, the board shall continue the disability retirement allowance of the beneficiary until such time as employment is available, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this section.

3. Should a disability beneficiary reenter city service and be eligible for membership in the retirement system, his or her retirement allowance shall be canceled and he or she shall immediately become a member of the retirement system, his or her rate of contribution for future years being that established for his or her age at the time of such reentry. His or her individual account shall be credited with his or her accumulated contributions less the annuity payments made to him or her. An amount equal to the accumulated normal contributions so credited to him or her shall again be held for the benefit of said member and shall no longer be included in the amounts available to meet the obligations of the city on account of benefits that have been granted. Such member shall receive credit for prior service in the same manner as if he or she had never been retired for disability.

4. Should any disability beneficiary under age sixty-two in the miscellaneous personnel or under age fifty-five in the uniformed personnel, refuse to submit to medical examination, his or her retirement allowance may be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and should refusal continue for one year, his or her retirement allowance may be canceled. Should said disability beneficiary, prior to attaining age sixty-two or age fifty-five, as the case may be, engage in a gainful occupation the board shall reduce the amount of his or her retirement allowance to an amount, which when added to the compensation earned by him or her in such occupation, shall not exceed the amount of the final compensation on the basis of which his or her retirement allowance was determined. Should the earning capacity of such beneficiary be further altered, the board may further alter his or her retirement allowance as indicated above. When said disability beneficiary reaches age sixty-two, if included in the miscellaneous personnel, or age fifty-five, in the uniformed personnel, his or her retirement allowance shall be made equal to the amount upon which he or she was originally retired, and shall not again be modified for any cause except as provided in RCW 41.44.250.

5. Should the retirement allowance of any disability beneficiary be canceled for any cause other than reentrance into city service, he or she shall be paid his or her accumulated contributions, less annuity payments made to him or her.

2. Should a former member, within five years after discontinuance of service, return to service in the same city in which he or she was employed he or she may restore to the fund in such manner as may be agreed upon by such person and the board, his or her withdrawn normal accumulated contributions as they were at the time of his or her separation from service and upon completion of such redeposit all his or her rights and privileges existing at the time of discontinuance of service shall be restored and his or her obligations as a member shall begin again.

Said allowance shall become payable upon the death of said member or upon the date the surviving spouse becomes ineligible for any benefit payment from the Federal OASI, if later, and shall cease upon death or remarriage, or upon the date the surviving spouse would become entitled, upon application therefor; to any insurance benefit from the Federal OASI system, whichever event shall first occur: PROVIDED, That said benefit shall cease upon the beneficiary becoming employed by any member city of said system: PROVIDED FURTHER, That this allowance shall consist of:

   a. An amount which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal contributions at the time specified for retirement;

   b. An amount provided by the contributions of the city, equal to the annuity purchased by the accumulated normal contributions of the member;

   c. Such additional amount, provided by the contributions of the city, as will make the total allowance equal to one-fourth average final compensation per month;

   d. An annuity purchased by the accumulated additional contributions, if any, in addition to the minimum guaranteed.

5. In lieu of the death benefit otherwise payable under subsection (3) of this section, the surviving spouse of a member who dies after having attained the minimum requirements for his or her service retirement as required by RCW 41.44.140 may elect to receive the allowance which would have been paid to such surviving spouse had the member been retired on the date of his or her death and had he or she elected to receive the lesser retirement allowances provided for in option C of RCW 41.44.220.

6. If a former member shall, within one year from date of discontinuance of service, be employed by another city participating in this retirement system he or she shall have the privilege of redepositing and the matching contributions deposited by the city or cities in which he or she was formerly employed shall again be held for the benefit of such member.

## 41.44.200 - Withdrawal—Procedure as to city's contribution.
Whenever a member withdraws his or her accumulated normal contributions the matching contributions of the city so released shall be transferred to a reserve account created for the purpose of showing the amount of credits due each city through such operation. Such credits may be used by the city to apply on any charges made against the city but only so much thereof as will insure leaving in such account an amount estimated to be sufficient to again match contributions redeposited by employees returning to service as contemplated in RCW 41.44.190. The board may credit such reserve accounts with interest at such rate as the board deems equitable: PROVIDED, That as to any member city which has elected to and is making contributions in lieu of those required in RCW 41.44.090(1)(a), there shall be no release of the city's matching contributions after the date of its commencement to make such lieu contributions: PROVIDED FURTHER, That any released contributions of any such city which have been credited to its reserve account prior to the date of such commencement, shall be available to it for the purposes hereinabove specified, unless the board shall determine that their immediate use for such purposes would result in a harmful effect upon the assets of the system, in which event the board shall have the right to defer their use for a reasonable time in which to permit it to make adjustments in the current assets of the system to prevent the same.
