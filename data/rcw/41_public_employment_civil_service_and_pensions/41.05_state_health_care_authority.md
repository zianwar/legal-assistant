## 41.05.004 - Intent—Use of word "board."
It is the intent of the legislature that the word "board" be read to mean both the school employees' benefits board and the public employees' benefits board throughout this chapter. The use of "board" should be liberally construed to mean both boards, to the extent not in conflict with state or federal law. In no case shall either board be limited from exercising its individual authority as authorized within this chapter.

\[ [2018 c 260 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6241-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20260%20§%205); \]

## 41.05.006 - Purpose.
1. The legislature recognizes that (a) the state is a major purchaser of health care services, (b) the increasing costs of such health care services are posing and will continue to pose a great financial burden on the state, (c) it is the state's policy, consistent with the best interests of the state, to provide comprehensive health care as an employer, to employees and school employees, officials, their dependents, and to those who are dependent on the state for necessary medical care, and (d) it is imperative that the state begin to develop effective and efficient health care delivery systems and strategies for procuring health care services in order for the state to continue to purchase the most comprehensive health care possible.

2. It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish the Washington state health care authority whose purpose shall be to (a) develop health care benefit programs that provide access to at least one comprehensive benefit plan funded to the fullest extent possible by the employer, and a health savings account/high deductible health plan option as defined in section 1201 of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003, as amended, for eligible employees and school employees, officials, and their dependents, and (b) study all state purchased health care, alternative health care delivery systems, and strategies for the procurement of health care services and make recommendations aimed at minimizing the financial burden which health care poses on the state, employees and school employees, and its charges, while at the same time allowing the state to provide the most comprehensive health care options possible.

\[ [2018 c 260 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6241-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20260%20§%202); [2006 c 299 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1383.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20299%20§%201); [1988 c 107 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c107.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20107%20§%202); \]

## 41.05.008 - Duties of employing agencies.

2. Employing agencies shall report all data relating to employees eligible to participate in benefits or plans administered by the authority in a format designed and communicated by the authority.

\[ [2009 c 537 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2245-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20537%20§%201); [2005 c 143 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1286.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20143%20§%204); \]

## 41.05.009 - Determination of employee or school employee eligibility for benefits.
1. The authority, or an employing agency at the authority's direction, shall initially determine and periodically review whether an employee or a school employee is eligible for benefits pursuant to the criteria established under this chapter.

2. An employing agency shall inform an employee or a school employee in writing whether or not he or she is eligible for benefits when initially determined and upon any subsequent change, including notice of the employee's or school employee's right to an appeal.

\[ [2018 c 260 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6241-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20260%20§%203); [2015 c 116 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5466.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20116%20§%201); [2009 c 537 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2245-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20537%20§%202); \]

## 41.05.0091 - Eligibility exists prior to January 1, 2010.
An employee determined eligible for benefits prior to January 1, 2010, shall not have his or her eligibility terminated pursuant to the criteria established under chapter 537, Laws of 2009 unless the termination is the result of: (1) A voluntary reduction in work hours; or (2) the employee's employment with an agency other than the agency by which he or she was determined eligible prior to January 1, 2010.

\[ [2009 c 537 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2245-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20537%20§%2010); \]

   c. Strive to integrate purchasing for all publicly sponsored health services in order to maximize the cost control potential and promote the most efficient methods of financing and coordinating services;

   d. Consult regularly with the governor, the legislature, and state agency directors whose operations are affected by the implementation of this section; and

   e. Ensure the control of benefit costs under managed competition by adopting rules to prevent an employing agency from entering into an agreement with employees or employee organizations when the agreement would result in increased utilization in board plans or reduce the expected savings of managed competition.

      ii. An employee who works an average of at least eighty hours per month over a period of six consecutive months and for at least eight hours in each of those six consecutive months becomes eligible at the first of the month following the six-month averaging period.

   b.

A seasonal employee determined ineligible at the beginning of his or her employment who works an average of at least eighty hours per month over a period of six consecutive months and at least eight hours in each of those six consecutive months becomes eligible at the first of the month following the six-month averaging period. A benefits-eligible seasonal employee who works a season of less than nine months shall not be eligible for the employer contribution during the off season, but may continue enrollment in benefits during the off season by self-paying for the benefits. A benefits-eligible seasonal employee who works a season of nine months or more is eligible for the employer contribution through the off season following each season worked.

   c. Faculty are eligible as follows:

      i. Faculty who the employing agency anticipates will work half–time or more for the entire instructional year or equivalent nine-month period are eligible for benefits from the date of employment. Eligibility shall continue until the beginning of the first full month of the next instructional year, unless the employment relationship is terminated, in which case eligibility shall cease the first month following the notice of termination or the effective date of the termination, whichever is later.

      ii. Faculty who the employing agency anticipates will not work for the entire instructional year or equivalent nine-month period are eligible for benefits at the beginning of the second consecutive quarter or semester of employment in which he or she is anticipated to work, or has actually worked, half-time or more.

The analysis must include any impact on hospitals' operating margins during the years public option health plans have been offered in the state and the estimated impact on operating margins in future years if enrollment in public option plans increases. It must also examine the income levels of public option plan enrollees over time. The analysis may examine a sample of hospitals of various sizes and located in various counties.
