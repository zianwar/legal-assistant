2. If a member has withdrawn contributions from a prior system, the member may restore the contributions, together with interest since the date of withdrawal as determined by the system, and recover the service represented by the contributions. Such restoration must be completed within two years of establishing dual membership or prior to retirement, whichever occurs first.

3. If a member does not meet the time limitation under subsection (2) of this section, the member, prior to retirement, may restore the service credit destroyed by the withdrawn contributions by paying the amount required under RCW 41.50.165(2).

4. Any service accrued in one system by the member shall not accrue in any other system.

## 41.54.030 - Calculation of service retirement allowance.
1. A dual member may combine service in all systems for the purpose of:

3. The service retirement allowances from a system which, but for this section, would not be allowed to be paid at this date based on the dual member's age may be received immediately or deferred to a later date. The allowances shall be actuarially adjusted from the earliest age upon which the combined service would have made such dual member eligible in that system.

4. The service retirement eligibility requirements of RCW 41.40.180 shall apply to any dual member whose prior system is plan 1 of the public employees' retirement system established under chapter 41.40 RCW.

## 41.54.032 - Calculation of disability retirement allowance.
1. If a dual member becomes disabled, the member's service in all systems may be combined for the sole purpose of determining the member's eligibility to receive a disability retirement allowance from the member's current system.

## 41.54.034 - Calculation of surviving spouse's death benefit.
1. If a dual member dies in service in any system, the member's service in all systems may be combined for the sole purpose of determining the surviving spouse's eligibility to receive a death benefit from each of the member's current and prior systems.

2. Each system shall use its own criteria to:

   a. Determine the surviving spouse's eligibility for a death benefit; and

   b. Calculate the death benefit based on service actually established in that system.

When a dual member's combined retirement allowances would exceed the limitation imposed by this subsection, the allowances shall be reduced by the systems on a proportional basis, according to service. The limitation imposed by this subsection shall not apply to a dual member with:

   i. Less than fifteen years of service credit in a plan with a retirement benefit cap as defined by the department; and

      ii. Service credit in a plan with no retirement benefit cap.
