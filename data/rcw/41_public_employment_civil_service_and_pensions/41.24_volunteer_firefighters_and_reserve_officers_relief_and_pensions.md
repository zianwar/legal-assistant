However, if the participant has a wife or husband and/or a child or children unemancipated or under eighteen years of age, he or she is entitled to draw from the fund monthly the additional sums of two hundred fifty-five dollars because of the fact of his wife or her husband, and one hundred ten dollars because of the fact of each child unemancipated or under eighteen years of age, all to a total maximum amount of two thousand five hundred fifty dollars.

   b. Beginning on July 1, 2001, and each July 1st thereafter, the compensation amounts specified in (a)(ii) of this subsection shall be readjusted to reflect the percentage change in the consumer price index, calculated as follows: The index for the calendar year preceding the year in which the July calculation is made, to be known as "calendar year A," is divided by the index for the calendar year preceding calendar year A, and the resulting ratio is multiplied by the compensation amount in effect on June 30th immediately preceding the July 1st on which the respective calculation is made. For the purposes of this subsection, "index" means the same as the definition in RCW 2.12.037(1).

2. The state board may at any time reopen the grant of such disability pension if the pensioner is gainfully employed, and may reduce it in the proportion that the annual income from such gainful employment bears to the annual income received by the pensioner at the time of his or her disability.

3. Where a participant sustains a permanent partial disability the state board may provide that the injured participant receive a lump sum compensation therefor to the same extent as is provided for permanent partial disability under the workers' compensation act under Title 51 RCW in lieu of such monthly disability payments.

1. One of the primary purposes of this section is to enable injured participants to return to their regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit. To this end, the state board shall utilize the services of individuals and organizations, public or private, whose experience, training, and interests in vocational rehabilitation and retraining qualify them to lend expert assistance to the state board in such programs of vocational rehabilitation as may be reasonable to make the participant return to his or her regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit consistent with his or her physical and mental status. After evaluation and recommendation by such individuals or organizations and prior to final evaluation of the participant's permanent disability, if in the sole opinion of the state board, whether or not medical treatment has been concluded, vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured participant to return to his or her regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit, the state board may, in its sole discretion, pay the cost as provided in subsection (3) or (4) of this section.

2. When, in the sole discretion of the state board, vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the participant return to his or her regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit, then the following order of priorities shall be used:

   a. Return to the previous job with the same employer;

   b. Modification of the previous job with the same employer including transitional return to work;

   c. A new job with the same employer in keeping with any limitations or restrictions;

   d. Modification of a new job with the same employer including transitional return to work;

   e. Modification of the previous job with a new employer;

   f. A new job with a new employer or self-employment based upon transferable skills;

   g. Modification of a new job with a new employer;

   h. A new job with a new employer or self-employment involving on-the-job training;

   i. Short-term retraining and job placement.

   a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the state board under subsection (1) of this section may include the cost of books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, transportation, child or dependent care, and other necessary expenses in an amount not to exceed four thousand dollars. This amount must be used within fifty-two weeks of the determination that vocational rehabilitation is permitted under this section.

   b.

   a. Whenever a participant dies as the result of injuries received, or sickness contracted in consequence or as the result of the performance of his or her duties, the board of trustees shall order and direct the payment from the principal fund of (i) the sum of two hundred fourteen thousand dollars to his widow or her widower, or if there is no widow or widower, then to his or her dependent child or children, or if there is no dependent child or children, then to his or her dependent parents or either of them, or if there are no dependent parents or parent, then the death benefit shall be paid to the member's estate, and (ii)(A) the sum of one thousand two hundred seventy-five dollars per month to his widow or her widower, with (B) an additional amount of five hundred dollars per month paid to the legal guardian or surviving parent of each birth or legally adopted child, unemancipated or under eighteen years of age, and dependent upon the member for support at the time of his or her death.

   b. Beginning on July 1, 2001, and each July 1st thereafter, the compensation amounts specified in (a)(ii)(A) and (B) of this subsection shall be readjusted to reflect the percentage change in the consumer price index, calculated as follows: The index for the calendar year preceding the year in which the July calculation is made, to be known as "calendar year A," is divided by the index for the calendar year preceding calendar year A, and the resulting ratio is multiplied by the compensation amount in effect on June 30th immediately preceding the July 1st on which the respective calculation is made. For the purposes of this subsection, "index" means the same as the definition in RCW 2.12.037(1).

2. In the case provided for in this section, the monthly payment provided may be converted in whole or in part into a lump sum payment, not in any case to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, equal or proportionate, as the case may be, to the actuarial equivalent of the monthly payment in which event the monthly payments shall cease in whole or in part accordingly or proportionately. Such conversion may be made either upon written application to the state board and shall rest in the discretion of the state board; or the state board is authorized to make, and authority is given it to make, on its own motion, lump sum payments, equal or proportionate, as the case may be, to the value of the annuity then remaining in full satisfaction of claims due to dependents. Within the rule under this subsection the amount and value of the lump sum payment may be agreed upon between the applicant and the state board.

## 41.24.170 - Retirement pensions. (Contingent expiration date.)
Except as provided in RCW 41.24.410, whenever any participant has been a member and served honorably for a period of ten years or more as an active member in any capacity, of any regularly organized fire department or law enforcement agency of any municipality in this state, and which municipality has adopted appropriate legislation allowing its firefighters or reserve officers to enroll in the retirement pension provisions of this chapter, and the participant has enrolled under the retirement pension provisions and has reached the age of sixty-five years, the board of trustees shall order and direct that he or she be retired and be paid a monthly pension from the principal fund as provided in this section.

Whenever a participant has been a member, and served honorably for a period of twenty-five years or more as an active member in any capacity, of any regularly organized volunteer fire department or law enforcement agency of any municipality in this state, and he or she has reached the age of sixty-five years, and the annual retirement fee has been paid for a period of twenty-five years, the board of trustees shall order and direct that he or she be retired and such participant be paid a monthly pension of three hundred dollars from the fund for the balance of that participant's life.

1. Any participant, who is older than fifty-nine years of age, less than sixty-five years of age, and has completed twenty-five years or more of service may irrevocably elect a reduced monthly pension in lieu of the pension that participant would be entitled to under this section at age sixty-five. The participant who elects this option shall receive the reduced pension for the balance of his or her life. The reduced monthly pension is calculated as a percentage of the pension the participant would be entitled to at age sixty-five. The percentage used in the calculation is based upon the age of the participant at the time of retirement as follows:

Age 60     Sixty percent

Age 61     Sixty-eight percent

Age 62     Seventy-six percent

Age 63     Eighty-four percent

Age 64     Ninety-two percent

   b. Upon completion of fifteen years, but less than twenty years of service, a monthly pension equal to thirty-five percent of such pension as the participant would have been entitled to receive at age sixty-five after twenty-five years of service; and

   c. Upon completion of twenty years, but less than twenty-five years of service, a monthly pension equal to seventy-five percent of such pension as the participant would have been entitled to receive at age sixty-five after twenty-five years of service.

3. If a participant with less than twenty-five years of service elects to retire after turning age sixty but before turning age sixty-five, the participant's retirement allowance is subject:

   a. First to the reduction under subsection (2) of this section based upon the participant's years of service; and

   b. Second to the reduction under subsection (1) of this section based upon the participant's age.
