The annual adjustment is determined by multiplying two million dollars by one plus the percentage by which the most recent October consumer price index exceeds the consumer price index for October 2012, and rounding the result to the nearest one thousand dollars. No adjustment is made for a calendar year if the adjustment would result in the same or a lesser applicable exclusion amount than the applicable exclusion amount for the immediately preceding calendar year. The applicable exclusion amount under this subsection (1)(a)(iii) for the decedent's estate is the applicable exclusion amount in effect as of the date of the decedent's death.

   b. If any property in the decedent's estate is located outside of Washington, the amount of tax is the amount determined in (a) of this subsection multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the value of the property located in Washington. The denominator of the fraction is the value of the decedent's gross estate. Property qualifying for a deduction under RCW 83.100.046 must be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the fraction.

3. The tax imposed under this section is a stand-alone estate tax that incorporates only those provisions of the internal revenue code as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2005, that do not conflict with the provisions of this chapter. The tax imposed under this chapter is independent of any federal estate tax obligation and is not affected by termination of the federal estate tax.

## 83.100.046 - Deduction—Property used for farming—Requirements, conditions.
1. For the purposes of determining the Washington taxable estate, a deduction is allowed from the federal taxable estate for:

   a. The value of qualified real property reduced by any amounts allowable as a deduction in respect of the qualified real property under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2053(a)(4) of the federal internal revenue code, if the decedent was at the time of his or her death a citizen or resident of the United States.

   b. The value of any tangible personal property used by the decedent or a member of the decedent's family for a qualified use on the date of the decedent's death, reduced by any amounts allowable as a deduction in respect of the tangible personal property under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2053(a)(4) of the federal internal revenue code, if all of the requirements of subsection (10)(f)(i)(A) of this section are met and the decedent was at the time of his or her death a citizen or resident of the United States.

   c. The value of real property that is not deductible under (a) of this subsection solely by reason of subsection (10)(f)(i)(B) of this section, reduced by any amounts allowable as a deduction in respect of the real property under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2053(a)(4) of the federal internal revenue code, if the requirements of subsection (10)(f)(i)(C) of this section are met with respect to the property and the decedent was at the time of his or her death a citizen or resident of the United States.

2. Property will be considered to have been acquired from or to have passed from the decedent if:

   a. The property is so considered under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1014(b) of the federal internal revenue code;

   b. The property is acquired by any person from the estate; or

   c. The property is acquired by any person from a trust, to the extent the property is includible in the gross estate of the decedent.

3. If the decedent and the decedent's surviving spouse at any time held qualified real property as community property, the interest of the surviving spouse in the property must be taken into account under this section to the extent necessary to provide a result under this section with respect to the property which is consistent with the result which would have obtained under this section if the property had not been community property.

4. In the case of any qualified woodland, the value of trees growing on the woodland may be deducted if otherwise qualified under this section.

5. If property is qualified real property with respect to a decedent, hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the "first decedent," and the property was acquired from or passed from the first decedent to the surviving spouse of the first decedent, active management of the farm by the surviving spouse must be treated as material participation by the surviving spouse in the operation of the farm.

6. Property owned indirectly by the decedent may qualify for a deduction under this section if owned through an interest in a corporation, partnership, or trust as the terms corporation, partnership, or trust are used in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2032A(g) of the federal internal revenue code. In order to qualify for a deduction under this subsection, the interest, in addition to meeting the other tests for qualification under this section, must qualify under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6166(b)(1) of the federal internal revenue code as an interest in a closely held business on the date of the decedent's death and for sufficient other time, combined with periods of direct ownership, to equal at least five years of the eight-year period preceding the death.

7. [Empty]

   a. If, on the date of the decedent's death, the requirements of subsection (10)(f)(i)(C)(II) of this section with respect to the decedent for any property are not met, and the decedent (i) was receiving old age benefits under Title II of the social security act for a continuous period ending on such date, or (ii) was disabled for a continuous period ending on this date, then subsection (10)(f)(i)(C)(II) of this section must be applied with respect to the property by substituting "the date on which the longer of such continuous periods began" for "the date of the decedent's death" in subsection (10)(f)(i)(C) of this section.

   b. For the purposes of (a) of this subsection, an individual is disabled if the individual has a mental or physical impairment which renders that individual unable to materially participate in the operation of the farm.

8. Property may be deducted under this section whether or not special valuation is elected under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2032A of the federal internal revenue code on the federal return. For the purposes of determining the deduction under this section, the value of property is its value as used to determine the value of the gross estate.

9. [Empty]

   a. In the case of any qualified replacement property, any period during which there was ownership, qualified use, or material participation with respect to the replaced property by the decedent or any member of the decedent's family must be treated as a period during which there was ownership, use, or material participation, as the case may be, with respect to the qualified replacement property.

   b. Subsection (9)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent that the fair market value of the qualified replacement property, as of the date of its acquisition, exceeds the fair market value of the replaced property, as of the date of its disposition.

   a. For the taxpayer that made the election, any amount deducted by reason of section 2056(b)(7) of the internal revenue code is added to, and the value of property for which a Washington election under this section was made is deducted from, the Washington taxable estate.

   b. For the estate of the surviving spouse, the amount included in the estate's gross estate pursuant to section 2044 (a) and (b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code is deducted from, and the value of any property for which an election under this section was previously made is added to, the Washington taxable estate.
