## 87.03.013 - Development of hydroelectric generation capabilities—Legislative finding, intent—Limitation.
The legislature finds that a significant potential exists for the development of the hydroelectric generation capabilities of present and future irrigation systems serving irrigation districts. The legislature also finds that the development of such hydroelectric generation capabilities is beneficial to the present and future electrical needs of the citizens of the state of Washington, furthers a state purpose and policy, and is in the public interest. The legislature further finds that it is necessary to revise and add to the authority of irrigation districts to obtain the most favorable interest rates possible in the financing of irrigation district projects which serve the agricultural community and hydroelectric facilities. It is the intent of the legislature to provide irrigation districts with the authority to develop these hydroelectric generation capabilities in connection with irrigation facilities. Further, it is the intent of the legislature that the development of hydroelectric generation capabilities pursuant to *this 1979 act not become the sole purpose or function of irrigation districts in existence on May 14, 1979, nor become a major function of irrigation districts created after that date. Nothing herein shall authorize an irrigation district to sell electric power or energy to any municipal corporation not engaged in the distribution of electric power or energy.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 185 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c185.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%20185%20§%201); \]

## 87.03.015 - Certain powers of district enumerated.

If an irrigation district enters into a contract or agreement under this subsection to create a legal entity or undertaking with an investor-owned utility or a private commercial or industrial entity, that contract or agreement must provide that the irrigation district be severally liable only for its own acts and not jointly or severally liable for the acts, omissions, or obligations of an investor-owned utility or a private commercial or industrial entity. No money or property supplied by any irrigation district for the planning, financing, acquisition, construction, operation, or maintenance of any common facility may be credited or otherwise applied to the account of any investor-owned utility or private commercial or industrial entity therein, nor may the undivided share of any irrigation district in any common facility be charged, directly or indirectly, with any debt or obligation of any investor-owned utility or private commercial or industrial entity or be subject to any lien as a result thereof. No action in connection with a common facility may be binding upon any irrigation district unless authorized or approved by resolution of its board.

8. To acquire from a water-sewer district wholly within the irrigation district's boundaries, by a conveyance without cost, the water-sewer district's water system and to operate the same to provide water for the domestic use of the irrigation district residents. As a part of its acceptance of the conveyance the irrigation district must agree to relieve the water-sewer district of responsibility for maintenance and repair of the system. Any such water-sewer district is authorized to make such a conveyance if all indebtedness of the water-sewer district, except local improvement district bonds, has been paid and the conveyance has been approved by a majority of the water-sewer district's voters voting at a general or special election.

9. To approve and condition placement of hydroelectric generation facilities by entities other than the district on water conveyance facilities operated or maintained by the district.

This section shall not be construed as in any manner abridging any other powers of an irrigation district conferred by law.

An authority shall not have power to levy taxes or to impose assessments for the payment of obligations of the authority. Every bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued by an authority shall provide (1) that repayment shall be limited solely to the revenues of the authority; and (2) that no member of the authority shall be obligated to repay directly or indirectly any obligation of the authority except to the extent of fair value for services actually received from the authority.

Bonds issued under the provisions of *this act shall be serial bonds payable in legal currency of the United States in such series and amounts as shall be determined and declared by the board of directors in the resolution calling the election: PROVIDED, That the first series shall mature not later than ten years and the last series not later than forty years from the date thereof: PROVIDED FURTHER, That bonds, authorized by a special election held in the district under the provisions of a former statute, which has subsequent to the authorization been amended, but not issued prior to the amendment of the former statute, may be issued in the form provided in the former statute, and any such bonds heretofore or hereafter so issued and sold are hereby confirmed and validated.

Notice of such bond election must be given by publication of such notice in some newspaper published in the county where the office of the board of directors of such district is required to be kept, once a week for at least two weeks (three times). Such notices must specify the time of holding the election, and the amount and maturities of bonds proposed to be issued; and the election must be held and the results thereof determined and declared in all respects as nearly as practicable in conformity with the provisions of law governing the election of the district officers: PROVIDED, That no informality in conducting such election shall invalidate the same, if the election shall have been otherwise fairly conducted.

If a majority of the votes cast are cast "Bonds Yes," the board of directors shall thereupon have authority to cause bonds in such amount and maturities to be issued. If the majority of the votes cast at any bond election are "Bonds No," the result of such election shall be so declared and entered of record; but if contract is made or is to be made with the United States as in RCW 87.03.140 provided, and bonds are not to be deposited with the United States in connection with such contract, the question submitted at such special election shall be whether contract shall be entered into with the United States. The notice of election shall state under the terms of what act or acts of congress contract is proposed to be made, and the maximum amount of money payable to the United States for construction purposes exclusive of penalties and interest. The ballots for such election shall contain the words "Contract with the United States Yes" and "Contract with the United States No," or words equivalent thereto. And whenever thereafter the board, in its judgment, deems it for the best interest of the district that the question of issuance of bonds for such amount, or any amount, or the question of entering into a contract with the United States, shall be submitted to the electors, it shall so declare, by resolution recorded in its minutes, and may thereupon submit such question to the electors in the same manner and with like effect as at such previous election.

The printed, engraved, or lithographed facsimile signatures of the president and secretary of the district's board of directors shall be sufficient signatures on the bonds or any coupons: PROVIDED, That such facsimile signatures on the bonds may be used only after the filing, by the officer whose facsimile signature is to be used, with the secretary of state of his or her manual signature certified by him or her under oath, whereupon that officer's facsimile signature has the same legal effect as his or her manual signature: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That either the president of the board of directors' or the secretary's signature on the bonds shall be manually subscribed: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That whenever such facsimile reproduction of the signature of any officer is used in place of the manual signature of such officer, the district's board of directors shall specify in a written order or requisition to the printer, engraver, or lithographer the number of bonds or any coupons upon which such facsimile signature is to be printed, engraved, or lithographed and the manner of numbering the bonds or any coupons upon which such signature shall be placed. Within ninety days after the completion of the printing, engraving, or lithographing of such bonds or any coupons, the plate or plates used for the purpose of affixing the facsimile signature shall be destroyed, and it shall be the duty of the district's board of directors, within ninety days after receipt of the completed bonds or any coupons, to ascertain that such plate or plates have been destroyed. Every printer, engraver, or lithographer who, with the intent to defraud, prints, engraves, or lithographs a facsimile signature upon any bond or any coupon without written order of the district's board of directors, or fails to destroy such plate or plates containing the facsimile signature upon direction of such issuing authority, is guilty of a class B felony punishable according to chapter 9A.20 RCW.

3. Whenever the electors shall vote to authorize the issuance of bonds of the district such authorization shall nullify and cancel all unsold bonds previously authorized, and if the question is submitted to and carried by the electors at the bond election, any bond issue may be exchanged in whole or in part, at par, for any or all of a valid outstanding bond issue of the district when mutually agreeable to the owner or owners thereof and the district, and the amount of the last bond issue in excess, if any, of that required for exchange purposes, may be sold as in the case of an original issue. The bonds of any issue authorized to be exchanged in whole or in part for outstanding bonds shall state on their face the amount of such issue so exchanged, and shall contain a certificate of the treasurer of the district as to the amount of the bonds exchanged, and that the outstanding bonds have been surrendered and canceled: PROVIDED FURTHER, That where bonds have been authorized and unsold, the board of directors may submit to the qualified voters of the district the question of canceling the previous authorization, which question shall be submitted upon the same notice and under the same regulations as govern the submission of the original question of authorizing a bond issue. At such election the ballots shall contain the words "Cancellation Yes," and "Cancellation No," or words equivalent thereto. If at such election a majority of the votes are "Cancellation Yes," the issue shall be thereby canceled and no bonds may be issued thereunder. If the majority of ballots are "Cancellation No," the original authorization shall continue in force with like effect as though the cancellation election had not been held: PROVIDED, That bonds deposited with the United States in payment or in pledge may call for the payment of such interest at such rate or rates, may be of such denominations, and call for the repayment of the principal at such times as may be agreed upon between the board and the secretary of the interior.

4. Each issue shall be numbered consecutively as issued, and the bonds of each issue shall be numbered consecutively and bear date at the time of their issue. The bonds may be in any form, including bearer bonds or registered bonds as provided in RCW 39.46.030. The bonds shall express upon their face that they were issued by authority of **this act, stating its title and date of approval, and shall also state the number of issue of which such bonds are a part. In case the money received by the sale of all bonds issued be insufficient for the completion of plans of the canals and works adopted, and additional bonds be not voted, or a contract calling for additional payment to the United States be not authorized and made, as the case may be, it shall be the duty of the board of directors to provide for the completion of the plans by levy of assessments therefor. It shall be lawful for any irrigation districts which have heretofore issued and sold bonds under the law then in force, to issue in place thereof an amount of bonds not in excess of such previous issue, and to sell the same, or any part thereof, as hereinafter provided, or exchange the same, or any part thereof, with the owners of such previously issued bonds which may be outstanding, upon such terms as may be agreed upon between the board of directors of the district and the holders of such outstanding bonds: PROVIDED, That the question of such reissue of bonds shall have been previously voted upon favorably by the legally qualified electors of such district, in the same manner as required for the issue of original bonds, and the board shall not exchange any such bonds for a less amount in par value of the bonds received; all of such old issue in place of which new bonds are issued shall be destroyed whenever lawfully in possession of the board. Bonds issued under the provisions of this section may, when so authorized by the electors, include a sum sufficient to pay the interest thereon for a period not exceeding the first four years. Whenever an issue of bonds shall have been authorized pursuant to law, and any of the earlier series shall have been sold, and the later series, or a portion thereof, remain unsold, the directors may sell such later series pursuant to law, or such portion thereof as shall be necessary to pay the earlier series, or the directors may exchange the later series for the earlier series at not less than the par value thereof, the sale or exchange to be made not more than six months before the maturity of the earlier series and upon the exchange being made the maturing bonds shall be disposed of as hereinbefore provided in the case of bonds authorized to be exchanged in whole or in part for outstanding bonds.

5. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (4) of this section, such bonds may be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.

Beginning in the year preceding the maturity of the first series of the bonds of any issue, the board must from year to year increase said assessment for the ensuing years in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the outstanding bonds as they mature. Similar levy and assessment shall be made for the expense fund which shall include operation and maintenance costs for the ensuing year. The board shall also at the time of making the annual levy, estimate the amount of all probable delinquencies on said levy and shall thereupon levy a sufficient amount to cover the same and a further amount sufficient to cover any deficit that may have resulted from delinquent assessments for any preceding year. The board shall also, at the time of making the annual levy, estimate the amount of the assessments to be made against lands owned by the district, including local improvement assessments, and shall levy a sufficient amount to pay said assessments. All lands owned by the district shall be exempt from general state and county taxes: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That in the event any lands, and any improvements located thereon, acquired by the district by reason of the foreclosure of irrigation district assessments, shall be by said district resold on contract, then and in that event, said land, and any such improvements, shall be by the county assessor immediately placed upon the tax rolls for taxation as real property and shall become subject to general property taxes from and after the date of said contract, and the secretary of the said irrigation district shall be required to immediately report such sale within ten days from the date of said contract to the county assessor who shall cause the property to be entered on the tax rolls as of the first day of January following.

The board may also at the time of making the said annual levy, levy an amount not to exceed twenty-five percent of the whole levy for the said year for the purpose of creating a surplus fund. This fund may be used for any of the district purposes authorized by law. The assessments, when collected by the county treasurer, shall constitute a special fund, or funds, as the case may be, to be called respectively, the "Bond Fund of . . . . . . Irrigation District," the "Contract Fund of . . . . . . Irrigation District," the "Expense Fund of . . . . . . Irrigation District," the " Warrant Fund of . . . . . .

The treasurer of each county in which lands of the district are located shall collect and receipt for all assessments levied on lands within his or her county. There shall be deposited with the district treasurer all funds of the district. The district treasurer shall pay out such funds upon warrants issued by the county auditor against the proper funds of the district, except the sums to be paid out of the bond fund for interest and principal payments on bonds: PROVIDED, That in those districts which designate their own treasurer, the treasurer may issue the warrants or any checks when the district is authorized to issue checks.

Such preliminary notice, so far as claimant is able, shall advise the district; that the claimant has filed a claim or intends to file a claim against the district for alleged crop damage; shall give the name and present residence of the claimant; shall state the cause of the damage to the crop alleged to be damaged and the estimated amount of damage; and shall accurately locate and describe where the crop alleged to be damaged is located. Such preliminary notice may be given by claimant or by anyone acting in his or her behalf and need not be verified.

## 87.03.445 - Acquisition, construction, and operating funds—Tolls and assessments, alternative methods of—Liens, foreclosure of—Delinquencies by tenants.
1. The cost and expense of purchasing and acquiring property, and construction, reconstruction, extension, and betterment of the works and improvements herein provided for, and the expenses incidental thereto, and indebtedness to the United States for district lands assumed by the district, and for the carrying out of the purposes of this chapter, may be paid for by the board of directors out of the funds received from bond sales as well as other district funds.

2. For the purpose of defraying the costs and expenses of the organization of the district, and of the care, operation, management, maintenance, repair, and improvement of the district and its irrigation water, domestic water, electric power, drainage, or sewer facilities or of any portion thereof, or for the payment of any indebtedness due the United States or the state of Washington, or for the payment of district bonds, the board may either fix reasonable rates or tolls and charges, and collect the same from all persons for whom district service is made available for irrigation water, domestic water, electric power, drainage or sewerage, and other purposes, or it may provide for the payment of said costs and expenses by a levy of assessment therefor, or by both said rates or tolls and charges and assessment.

3. If the assessment method is utilized, the levy of assessments shall be made on the completion and equalization of the assessment roll each year, and the board shall have the same powers and functions for the purpose of said levy as possessed by it in case of levy to pay bonds of the district. The procedure for the collection of assessments by such levy shall in all respects conform with the provisions of this chapter, relating to the collection of assessments for the payment of principal and interest of bonds herein provided for, and shall be made at the same time.

4. If the rates or tolls and charges method is adopted in whole or in part, the secretary shall deliver to the board of directors, within the time for filing the assessment roll, a schedule containing the names of the owners or reputed owners, as shown on the rolls of the county treasurer as of the first Tuesday in November of each year such a schedule is filed of the various parcels of land against which rates or tolls and charges are to be levied, the description of each such parcel of land and the amount to be charged against each parcel for irrigation water, domestic water, electric power, drainage, sewerage, and other district costs and expenses. Said schedule of rates or tolls and charges shall be equalized pursuant to the same notice, in the same manner, at the same time and with the same legal effect as in the case of assessments. Such schedule of rates or tolls and charges for a given year shall be filed with the proper county treasurer within the same time as that provided by law for the filing of the annual assessment roll, and the county treasurer shall collect and receipt for the payment of said rates or tolls and charges and credit them to the proper funds of the district. The board may designate the time and manner of making such collections and shall require the same to be paid in advance of delivery of water and other service. For the purposes of collection and enforcement, all tolls and charges levied shall also at once become and constitute an assessment upon and against the lands for which they are levied, with the same force and effect, and the same manner of enforcement, and with the same rate of interest from date of delinquency, in case of nonpayment, as other district assessments. Any tolls and charges constituting an assessment for collection and enforcement purposes under this section are not subject to the provisions of RCW 87.03.240(1).

5. As an alternative method of imposing, collecting, and enforcing such rates or tolls and charges, the board may also base such rates or tolls and charges upon the quantity of irrigation water, domestic water, or electric power delivered, or drainage or sewage disposed of, and may fix a minimum rate or toll and charge to be paid by each parcel of land or use within the district for the delivery or disposal of a stated quantity of each such service with a graduated charge for additional quantities of such services delivered or disposed of. If the board elects to utilize this alternative method of imposing, collecting, and enforcing such rates or tolls and charges, there shall be no requirement that the schedule referred to in the preceding paragraph be prepared, be filed with the board of directors by the secretary, be equalized, or be filed with a county treasurer. The board shall enforce collection of such rates or tolls and charges against property to which and its owners to whom the service is available, such rates or tolls and charges being deemed charges and a lien against the property to which the service is available, until paid in full. Prior to furnishing services, a board may require a deposit to guarantee payment for services. However, failure to require a deposit does not affect the validity of any lien authorized by this section.

6. The board may provide by resolution that where such rates or tolls and charges are delinquent for any specified period of time, the district shall certify the delinquencies to the treasurer of the county in which the real property is located, and the charges and any penalties added thereto and interest thereon at the rate not to exceed twelve percent per annum fixed by resolution shall be a lien against the property to which the service was available, subject only to the lien for general taxes. The district may, at any time after such rates or tolls and charges and penalties provided for herein are delinquent for a period of one year, bring suit in foreclosure by civil action in the superior court of the county in which the real property is situated.

7. A board may determine how to apply partial payments on past due accounts.

8. A board may provide a real property owner or the owner's designee with duplicate bills for service to tenants, or may notify an owner or the owner's designee that a tenant's service account is delinquent. However, if an owner or the owner's designee notifies the board in writing that a property served by the board is a rental property, asks to be notified of a tenant's delinquency, and has provided, in writing, a complete and accurate mailing address, the board shall notify the owner or the owner's designee of a tenant's delinquency at the same time and in the same manner the board notifies the tenant of the tenant's delinquency or by mail. When a district provides a real property owner or the owner's designee with duplicates of tenant utility service bills or notice that a tenant's utility account is delinquent, the district shall notify the tenant that it is providing the duplicate bills or delinquency notice to the owner or the owner's designee. After January 1, 1999, if a board fails to notify the owner of a tenant's delinquency after receiving a written request to do so and after receiving the other information required by this subsection (8), the board shall have no lien against the premises for the tenant's delinquent and unpaid charges.

9. The court may allow, in addition to the costs and disbursements provided by statute, such attorneys' fees as it may adjudge reasonable. The action shall be in rem against the property, and in addition may be brought in the name of the district against an individual, or against all of those who are delinquent, in one action, and the rules of the court shall control as in other civil actions. The board may in the same year use the assessment method for part of the lands in the district and the rates or tolls and charges method for the remaining lands in the district in such proportion as it may deem advisable for the best interest of the district.

## 87.03.810 - Lump sum payment to district for irrigable lands acquired for highway purposes.
Whenever lands situated in an irrigation district are acquired by the department of transportation, and the lands, at the time of their acquisition by the department of transportation, were irrigable and were being served or were capable of being served by facilities of the district to the same extent and in the same manner as lands of like character held under private ownership were served, the department of transportation, as part of the cost and expense of the acquisition of rights-of-way and with funds available for the acquisition and at the time of the acquisition, shall make a lump sum payment to the irrigation district in an amount that is:

1. Sufficient to pay the pro rata share of the district's bonded indebtedness, if any, and the pro rata share of the district's contract indebtedness to the United States or to the state of Washington, if any, allocable to the lands, plus interest on the pro rata share if the indebtedness is not callable in advance of maturity; and

2. Further, sufficient to pay any deferred installments of local improvement district assessments against the lands, if any; and

3. Further, sufficient to produce, if invested at an annual rate of interest equivalent to that set forth in current tables issued by the state insurance commissioner, a sum of money equal to the annual increase in operation and maintenance costs against remaining lands in the district resulting from the severance from the district of the lands thus acquired by the department of transportation. For the purposes of determining the amount of the lump sum payment, the annual maintenance and operation assessment of the district shall be considered to be the average for the ten years, or so many years as the district has assessment experience if less than ten years, preceding the date of acquisition.

## 87.03.820 - Disposal of real property—Right of adjacent owners.
Whenever as the result of abandonment of an irrigation district right-of-way real property held by an irrigation district is to be sold or otherwise disposed of, notice shall be given to the owners of lands adjoining that real property and such owners shall have a right of first refusal to purchase at the appraised price all or any part of the real property to be sold or otherwise disposed of which adjoins or is adjacent to their land.

Real property to be sold or otherwise disposed of under this section shall have been first appraised by the county assessor or by a person designated by him or her.

Notice under this section shall be sufficient if sent by registered mail to the owner, and at the address, as shown in the tax records of the county in which the land is situated. Notice under this section shall be in addition to any other notice required by law.

After sixty days from the date of sending of notice, if no applications for purchase have been received by the irrigation district or other person or entity sending notice, the rights of first refusal of owners of adjoining lands shall be deemed to have been waived, and the real property may be sold or otherwise disposed of. When no applications for purchase have been received, if the irrigation district board of directors determines that due to the configuration of the abandoned right-of-way, or other facts, it appears unlikely that the property, or a portion of the property, can be sold for the appraised price, and the property is considered a burden to the irrigation district, the real property may be sold at a negotiated price, including a transfer for no payment, without further publication or notice to all adjoining owners.

If two or more owners of adjoining lands apply to purchase the same real property, or apply to purchase overlapping parts of the real property, the respective rights of the applicants may be determined in the superior court of the county in which the real property is situated; and the court may divide the real property in question between some or all of the applicants or award the whole to one applicant, as justice may require.

Any sale or other disposal of real property pursuant to chapters 87.52, 87.53, and 87.56 RCW shall be made in accordance with the requirements of this section.

Any authority so created shall have the same powers and only those powers granted to irrigation districts by chapter 185, Laws of 1979 ex. sess. and has such additional powers relating to its organization, right to contract in its own name, and general ability to exist and function as a separate legal authority as deemed appropriate by the entities creating it. The authority shall be created and organized by contract in the manner described in chapter 39.34 RCW and shall be a separate legal entity capable of exercising in its own name the powers granted it. No provision of chapter 39.34 RCW or any other provision of law may be interpreted to require the entities creating the authority to submit the contract creating the authority to any state, county, or municipal officer, entity, agency, or board for approval or disapproval.

An authority shall not have power to levy taxes or to impose assessments for the payment of obligations of the authority. Every bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued by an authority shall provide (1) that repayment shall be limited solely to the revenues of the authority, and (2) that no member of the authority shall be obligated to repay directly or indirectly any obligation of the authority except to the extent of fair value for services actually received from the authority. No member may pledge its revenues to support the issuance of revenue bonds or other indebtedness of an authority.

## 87.03.840 - Chapter supplementary—When.
This chapter supplements and neither restricts nor limits any powers which a city, town, public utility district, or irrigation district might otherwise have under any laws of this state, except that no such authority created by RCW 87.03.828 and no city, town, or public utility district member of an authority may condemn for the benefit of the authority any plant, works, dam, facility, right, or property owned by any city, town, irrigation district, public utility district, or electrical company subject to the jurisdiction of the utilities and transportation commission.

This section and RCW 87.03.847 through 87.03.855 provide the procedures by which a minor irrigation district may be merged into a major irrigation district as authorized by RCW 87.03.530(2).

To institute proceedings for such a merger, the board of directors of the minor district shall adopt a resolution requesting the board of directors of the major district to consider the merger, or proceedings for such a merger may be instituted by a petition requesting the board of directors of the major district to consider the merger, signed by ten owners of land within the minor district or five percent of the total number of landowners within the minor district, whichever is greater. However, if there are fewer than twenty owners of land within the minor irrigation district, the petition shall be signed by a majority of the landowners and filed with the board of directors of the major irrigation district.

For the purpose of determining the number of landowners required to initiate merger proceedings under this section, a husband and wife owning property as community property shall be considered a single landowner; two or more persons or entities holding title to property as tenants in common, joint tenants, tenants in partnership, or other form of joint ownership shall be considered a single landowner; and the petition requesting the merger shall be considered by the board of directors of the major irrigation district may be [if the petition is] signed by either the husband or wife and by any one of the co-owners of jointly owned property.

The board of directors of the major irrigation district shall consider the request at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors of the major district following its receipt of the minor district's request or at a special meeting called for the purpose of considering the request. If the board of the major district denies the request of the minor district, no further action on the request shall be taken.

## 87.03.847 - Merger of minor irrigation district into major irrigation district—Denial or adoption of request for merger—Notice—Elections—Notification of merger.
1. If, following the public hearing conducted under RCW 87.03.845, the board of directors of the major irrigation district denies the request for a merger, no further action shall be taken on the request. If, following the public hearing, the board adopts a resolution approving the merger, the merger is approved by the major irrigation district and no election shall be held in the major district to approve the merger. However, if the holders of title or evidence of title to at least twenty percent of the assessed lands within the major district file a protest opposing the merger with the board of the major district at or before the public hearing, the board shall call a special election and submit to the voters of the major district the question of whether the merger should or should not be approved. Votes shall be cast as "Merger - Yes" or "Merger - No." If such a special election must be conducted and a majority of all votes cast in the district approve the merger, the merger is approved by the major district. Such an approval is effective on the date the returns of the election are canvassed under RCW 87.03.105.

2. The board of directors of the minor irrigation district shall, within thirty days of the date the merger is approved by the major district or of the date the board of the major district issues its call for a special election on the merger, call a special election within the minor district and submit to the voters of the minor district the question of whether the merger should or should not be approved. If special elections must be conducted in both districts, both elections shall be conducted on the date set by the board of the major district. If only the minor district must conduct such a special election, the election shall be held not later than sixty days after the date the merger has been approved by the board of the major district. Votes on the question shall be cast as "Merger - Yes" or "Merger - No." If a majority of all votes cast in the district are cast for "Merger - Yes," the merger is approved by the minor irrigation district. Such an approval is effective on the date the returns of the election are canvassed under RCW 87.03.105.

3. Notice of election in each district on the merger question shall conform to the requirements of notices for elections in the major district. Elections and voting in each district shall be consistent with RCW 87.03.045, 87.03.051, and 87.03.071. If the majority of all votes cast in a special election in either the major or a minor district are cast for "Merger - No," the merger is not approved.

4. If the merger is approved by the major irrigation district and by the minor irrigation district as provided by this section, the minor irrigation district is merged into the major irrigation district. If two or more minor districts are merging with a major district in one process as authorized by RCW 87.03.855 and if the merger is approved by the major irrigation district and by at least one of the minor irrigation districts as provided by this section, each minor irrigation district so approving is merged into the major irrigation district. The effective date of the merger is the date by which approval of the merger has been secured in both districts or, under RCW 87.03.855, in the major and minor district or districts. The board or boards of county commissioners of the county or counties containing territory of the merged districts and the director of the department of ecology shall be notified that the districts have merged.

If the major district is considering a merger with more than one minor district, the board shall submit plans for the various possible mergers. The proposal or proposals shall be filed with the county legislative authority before the merger is approved in the major district or the minor district or districts. Following the merger, the county legislative authority shall approve the plan submitted for the districts that actually merged.

On the effective date of the merger, the directors of the minor district shall transfer the property and other assets of the district as required in RCW 87.03.853. Following the transfer of the property and other assets, the minor irrigation district and the office of director of the minor district shall cease to exist.

However, the board of directors of the merged district may, when authorized under RCW 87.03.200 and with the consent of the bondholders, exchange the bonds of the district created by the merger for the bonds of the districts that merged. If the major or minor district entered, prior to the merger, into a contract with the United States under this chapter and the board of directors of the district created by the merger proposes that the merged district enter into a contract with the United States, the board may do so when authorized under RCW 87.03.200 and may, with the consent of the United States, cancel any contract previously entered into between the major or minor district and the United States.

2. The district created by the merger shall be entitled to all remedies for the enforcement of the irrigation district assessments and other obligations of lands to the districts that merged as if the districts had not merged. All obligations incurred for irrigation district or local improvement district purposes by the lands within the major or minor district prior to its merger shall be a prior lien to any obligation that may be incurred against those lands after the merger.

3. Until premerger assessments have been collected and all of the premerger indebtedness of the major and minor districts that merged have been paid, separate funds shall be maintained for each district as were maintained in each prior to the merger. The board of directors of the irrigation district created by the merger may establish a local improvement district for each district included in the merger to carry out the obligations of each such district. This board shall have all the powers possessed by the boards of directors of the districts included in the merger to carry out all contracts of the included districts and to levy, assess, and cause to be collected any and all assessments or charges against the lands of each of the included districts. A petition shall not be required for the formation of a local improvement district created for this purpose.
