If the board deems it against the best interests of the district to divide the district into director divisions or to redivide existing divisions, it shall order the petition rejected, but if it deems it for the best interests of the district that the petition be granted, and if no elector of the district files cause in writing at said hearing why the petition should not be granted, or if having filed said cause in writing withdraws the same, the board shall enter an order dividing or redividing the district into the same number of director divisions as there are directors of the district, and designating the divisions and describing the boundaries thereof.
