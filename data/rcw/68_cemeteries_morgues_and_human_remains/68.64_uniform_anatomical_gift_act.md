2. A donor's revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RCW 68.64.050 is not a refusal and does not bar another person specified in RCW 68.64.030 or 68.64.080 from making an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under RCW 68.64.040 or 68.64.090.

5. In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under RCW 68.64.030, an anatomical gift of a part is neither a refusal to give another part nor a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of another part at a later time by the donor or another person.

6. In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under RCW 68.64.030, an anatomical gift of a part for one or more of the permitted purposes is not a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of the part for any of the other purposes by the donor or any other person under RCW 68.64.040 or 68.64.090.

7. If a donor who is an unemancipated minor dies, a parent of the donor who is reasonably available may revoke or amend an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part.

\[ [2008 c 139 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1637-S.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20139%20§%208); \]

If an objection is known, the gift may be made only by a majority of the members of the class who are reasonably available.

3. A person may not make an anatomical gift if, at the time of the decedent's death, a person in a prior class under subsection (1) of this section is reasonably available to make or to object to the making of an anatomical gift.
