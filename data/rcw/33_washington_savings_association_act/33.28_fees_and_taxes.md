## 33.28.040 - Taxation of associations.
The fees provided for in this title shall be in lieu of all other corporation fees, licenses, or excises for the privilege of doing business, except for business and occupation taxes imposed pursuant to chapter 82.04 RCW, and except for license fees or taxes imposed by a city or town under RCW 82.14A.010, notwithstanding any other provisions of this section.

Neither an association nor its members shall be taxed upon its deposit accounts as property, nor shall a domestic association be taxed upon its real and tangible personal property at a rate greater than any federal association doing business in this state.

For all purposes of taxation, the assets represented by the contingent fund, guaranty fund, and other reserves (other than reserves for expenses and specific losses) of an association shall be deemed its only permanent capital and, in computing any tax, whether property, income, or excise, appropriate adjustments shall be made to give effect to the nature of such association.
