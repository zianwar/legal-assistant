Any savings account in the "Dormant Accounts" fund shall not participate in the earnings of the association except by permissive action of the directors of the association. The member, or his or her or its executor, administrator, successors or assigns, may claim the amount so transferred from his or her account to the dormant accounts fund at any time after such transfer. Should the association be placed in liquidation while any savings account shall remain credited in the dormant accounts fund and before any valid claim shall have been made thereto, as hereinabove provided, such savings account so credited, upon order of the director and without any other escheat proceedings, shall escheat to the state of Washington.

## 33.20.150 - Deposits with interest to be repaid on request—Postponement of withdrawals—Procedure.
The deposits paid into an association, together with any interest credited thereon, shall be repaid to the depositors thereof respectively, or to their legal representatives, upon request.

If, in the judgment of the board, circumstances warrant deferment of the payment of withdrawals from savings accounts to a later date, thereafter withdrawals shall be paid proportionately, on a percentage basis, to all depositors requesting withdrawal until full withdrawal requests are paid to all depositors. A board resolution of deferment shall not affect the payments of withdrawals from federal tax and loan accounts.

The board shall, however, have the right in its discretion, where need is shown, to pay not exceeding one hundred dollars to any account holder in one month.

If, upon examination, the director finds that further postponement of withdrawals is unwarranted, the director may order the association to resume full payment of withdrawals and cancel all written withdrawal requests. Such order shall be in writing.

The association's failure, during a period of postponement, to pay withdrawal requests shall not authorize the director to take charge of or liquidate the association.

## 33.20.170 - Withdrawals may be limited—Conditions.
The director further is empowered, if in his or her judgment the circumstances warrant it, to issue in writing a declaration that an acute business depression, state of panic, or economic emergency exists, in which event the directors of any association, state or federal, within the state may limit withdrawals by resolution, subject to the following conditions; that incoming funds shall be applied:

First, to the payment of operating expenses, indebtedness, taxes, insurance, and to the necessary charges for the protection of the association and its investments;

Second, to the payment to members of emergency withdrawals not exceeding twenty-five dollars per month to any member. The board of directors of any association, with the prior written approval of the director, by resolution may authorize the payment of emergency withdrawals not exceeding one hundred dollars per month to any member;

Third, to the payment of dividends on the savings of its members;

Fourth, three-fourths of all remaining receipts of the association, except interest payments, shall be applied to the payment of withdrawals, until all withdrawal requests have been paid.
