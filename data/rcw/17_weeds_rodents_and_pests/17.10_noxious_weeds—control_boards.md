## 17.10.030 - State noxious weed control board—Members—Terms—Elections—Meetings—Reimbursement for travel expenses.
There is created a state noxious weed control board comprised of nine voting members and four nonvoting members. Four of the voting members shall be elected by the members of the various activated county noxious weed control boards, and shall be residents of a county in which a county noxious weed control board has been activated and a member of said board, and those qualifications shall continue through their term of office. Two of these members shall be elected from the west side of the state, the crest of the Cascades being the dividing line, and two from the east side of the state. The director of agriculture is a voting member of the board. One voting member shall be elected by the directors of the various active weed districts formed under chapter 17.04 or 17.06 RCW. The Washington state association of counties appoints one voting member who shall be a member of a county legislative authority. A statewide association representing county noxious weed coordinators appoints a nonvoting technical advisor. The director shall appoint two voting members to represent the public interest, one from the west side and one from the east side of the state. The director shall also appoint three nonvoting members representing scientific disciplines relating to weed control. The term of office for all members of the board is four years from the date of election or appointment.

The board, by rule, shall establish a position number for each elected position of the board and shall designate which county noxious weed control board members are eligible to vote for each elected position. The elected members serve staggered terms. Elections for the elected members of the board shall be held thirty days prior to the expiration date of their respective terms. Nominations and elections shall be by mail and conducted by the board.

The board shall conduct its first meeting within thirty days after all its members have been elected. The board shall elect from its members a chair and other officers as may be necessary.

## 17.10.040 - Activation of inactive county noxious weed control board.
An inactive county noxious weed control board may be activated by any one of the following methods:

1. Either within sixty days after a petition is filed by one hundred registered voters within the county or, on its own motion, the county legislative authority shall hold a hearing to determine whether there is a need, due to a damaging infestation of noxious weeds, to activate the county noxious weed control board. If such a need is found to exist, then the county legislative authority shall, in the manner provided by RCW 17.10.050, appoint five persons to the county's noxious weed control board.

2. If the county's noxious weed control board is not activated within one year following a hearing by the county legislative authority to determine the need for activation, then upon the filing with the state noxious weed control board of a petition comprised either of the signatures of at least two hundred registered voters within the county, or of the signatures of a majority of an adjacent county's noxious weed control board, the state board shall, within six months of the date of the filing, hold a hearing in the county to determine the need for activation. If a need for activation is found to exist, then the state board shall order the county legislative authority to activate the county's noxious weed control board and to appoint members to the board in the manner provided by RCW 17.10.050.

3. The director, upon request of the state noxious weed control board, shall order a county legislative authority to activate the noxious weed control board immediately if an infestation of a class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed designated for control on the state noxious weed list is confirmed in that county. The county legislative authority may, as an alternative to activating the noxious weed board, combat the class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed with county resources and personnel operating with the authorities and responsibilities imposed by this chapter on a county noxious weed control board. No county may continue without a noxious weed control board for a second consecutive year if the class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed has not been eradicated.

In appointing the voting members, the county legislative authority shall divide the county into five geographical areas that best represent the county's interests, and appoint a voting member from each geographical area. At least three of the voting members shall be engaged in the primary production of agricultural products. There is one nonvoting member on the board who is the director of the county extension office or an extension agent appointed by the director of the county extension office. Each voting member of the board serves a term of four years, except that the county legislative authority shall, when a board is first activated under this chapter, designate two voting members to serve terms of two years. The board members shall not receive a salary but shall be compensated for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.

   a. The voting members of the board serve until their replacements are appointed. New members of the board shall be appointed at least thirty days prior to the expiration of any board member's term of office.

   b. Notice of expiration of a term of office shall be published at least twice in a weekly or daily newspaper of general circulation in the geographical area with last publication occurring at least ten days prior to the nomination. All persons interested in appointment to the board and residing in the geographical area with a pending nomination shall make a written application that includes the signatures of at least ten registered voters residing in the geographical area supporting the nomination to the county noxious weed control board. After nominations close, the county noxious weed control board shall, after a hearing, send the applications to the county legislative authority recommending the names of the most qualified candidates, and post the names of those nominees in the county courthouse or county website and publish in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county. The county legislative authority, within 60 days of receiving the list of nominees, shall appoint one of those nominees to the county noxious weed control board to represent that geographical area during that term of office. If the county legislative authority fails to appoint a nominee within the 60-day period and a quorum of the board is not seated, the county noxious weed control board shall appoint a nominee only to meet a quorum, who shall serve in that capacity until the county legislative authority appoints a nominee to fill the vacant position in the manner prescribed in this section. Not more than three board members may be appointed in this manner.

3. Within thirty days after all the members have been appointed, the board shall conduct its first meeting.

## 17.10.154 - Owners' agreements with county noxious weed control boards—Terms—Enforcement.
It is recognized that the prevention, control, and eradication of noxious weeds presents a problem for immediate as well as for future action. It is further recognized that immediate prevention, control, and eradication is practicable on some lands and that prevention, control, and eradication on other lands should be extended over a period of time. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter that county noxious weed control boards may use their discretion and, by agreement with the owners of land, may propose and accept plans for prevention, control, and eradication that may be extended over a period of years. The county noxious weed control board may make an agreement with the owner of any parcel of land by contract between the landowner and the respective county noxious weed control board, and the board shall enforce the terms of any agreement. The county noxious weed control board may make any terms that will best serve the interests of the owners of the parcel of land and the common welfare that comply with this chapter. Agreements made under this section must include at least a one thousand foot buffer for all adjacent agricultural land uses. Noxious weed control in this buffer must comply with RCW 17.10.140(1).

## 17.10.160 - Right of entry—Warrant for noxious weed search—Civil liability—Penalty for preventing entry.
Any authorized agent or employee of the county noxious weed control board or of the state noxious weed control board or of the department of agriculture where not otherwise proscribed by law may enter upon any property for the purpose of administering this chapter and any power exercisable pursuant thereto, including the taking of specimens of weeds, general inspection, and the performance of eradication or control work. Prior to carrying out the purpose for which the entry is made, the official making such entry or someone in his or her behalf, shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner of the property as to the purpose and need for the entry.

1. When there is probable cause to believe that there is property within this state not otherwise exempt from process or execution upon which noxious weeds are standing or growing and the owner refuses permission to inspect the property, a judge of the superior court or district court in the county in which the property is located may, upon the request of the county noxious weed control board or its agent, issue a warrant directed to the board or agent authorizing the taking of specimens of weeds or other materials, general inspection, and the performance of eradication or control work.

2. Application for issuance and execution and return of the warrant authorized by this section shall be in accordance with the applicable rules of the superior court or the district courts.

3. Nothing in this section requires the application for and issuance of any warrant not otherwise required by law: PROVIDED, That civil liability for negligence shall lie in any case in which entry and any of the activities connected therewith are not undertaken with reasonable care.

4. Any person who improperly prevents or threatens to prevent entry upon land as authorized in this section or any person who interferes with the carrying out of this chapter shall be upon conviction guilty of a misdemeanor.

## 17.10.170 - Finding presence of noxious weeds—Notice for failure of owner to control—Control by county board—Liability of owner—Lien—Alternative.
1. Whenever the county noxious weed control board finds that noxious weeds are present on any parcel of land, and that the owner is not taking prompt and sufficient action to control the noxious weeds, pursuant to the provisions of RCW 17.10.140, it shall notify the owner that a violation of this chapter exists. The notice shall be in writing and sent by certified mail, and shall identify the noxious weeds found to be present, order prompt control action, and specify the time, of at least ten days from issuance of the notice, within which the prescribed action must be taken. Upon deposit of the certified letter of notice, the noxious weed control authority shall make an affidavit of mailing that is prima facie evidence that proper notice was given. If seed or other propagule dispersion is imminent, immediate control action may be taken forty-eight hours following the time that notification is reasonably expected to have been received by the owner or agent by certified mail or personal service, instead of ten days. If a landowner received a notice of violation from the county noxious weed control board in a prior growing season, removal or destruction of all above ground plant parts may be required at the most effective point in the growing season, as determined by the county weed board, which may be before or after propagule dispersion.

2. The county noxious weed control board or its authorized agents may issue a notice of civil infraction as provided for in RCW 17.10.230, 17.10.310, and 17.10.350 to owners who do not take action to control noxious weeds in accordance with the notice.

3. If the owner does not take action to control the noxious weeds in accordance with the notice, the county board may control them, or cause their being controlled, at the expense of the owner. The amount of the expense constitutes a lien against the property and may be enforced by proceedings on the lien except as provided for by RCW 79.44.060. The owner is liable for payment of the expense, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collection of any judgment on account thereof by any means available pursuant to law, in substitution for enforcement of the lien. Necessary costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the county noxious weed control board in carrying out this section may be recovered at the same time as a part of the action filed under this section. Funds received in payment for the expense of controlling noxious weeds shall be transferred to the county noxious weed control board to be expended as required to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

## 17.10.240 - Budget for county noxious weed control board—Report to the legislature—Special assessments, appropriations for noxious weed control—Assessment rates.
1. [Empty]

   a. The activated county noxious weed control board of each county shall annually submit a budget to the county legislative authority for the operating cost of the county's weed program for the ensuing fiscal year: PROVIDED, That if the board finds the budget approved by the legislative authority is insufficient for an effective county noxious weed control program, the board may submit a budget amendment to the county legislative authority after which the county legislative authority must hold a hearing as provided in chapter 36.40 RCW. Activities and programs to limit economic loss and adverse effects due to the presence and spread of noxious weeds on all terrestrial and aquatic areas in the state are declared to be of special benefit, including to lands owned or held by the state, and may be used as the basis upon which special assessments are imposed by the county legislative authority.

   b. Representatives from the department of transportation government relations, real estate services, and maintenance operations offices, the Washington state association of county treasurers, the Washington state association of county assessors, and the state noxious weed control board shall meet to develop a system by which parcels owned or held by the department of transportation that have been declared to receive special benefit from the county noxious weed control board must be identified and all assessments may be effectively billed for payment according to the process in chapter 79.44 RCW. The state noxious weed control board shall update the appropriate legislative committees regarding progress towards implementation of a system before January 1, 2022. By January 1, 2023, the state noxious weed control board shall report to the appropriate legislative committees in compliance with RCW 43.01.036 regarding the system developed, what steps are being taken to implement the system, and what, if any, further legislative action is needed.

   c. Funding for the budget is derived from any or all of the following:

      i. The county legislative authority may, in lieu of a tax, levy an assessment against the land for this purpose. Whenever there is included within the jurisdiction of any county noxious weed control board lands owned or held by the state, the county legislative authority shall determine the amount of the assessment for which the land would be liable if the land were in private ownership. Prior to the levying of an assessment the county noxious weed control board shall hold a public hearing at which it will gather information to serve as a basis for classification and then classify the lands into suitable classifications, including but not limited to dry lands, range lands, irrigated lands, nonuse lands, forestlands, or federal lands. The board shall develop and forward to the county legislative authority, as a proposed level of assessment for each class, an amount as seems just. The assessment rate shall be either uniform per acre in its respective class or a flat rate per parcel rate plus a uniform rate per acre or, for rights-of-way, a rate based on centerline miles: PROVIDED, That if no benefits are found to accrue to a class of land, a zero assessment may be levied. The assessment shall not be levied on lands owned or held by the state, unless the assessment is levied on other parcels or classes of parcels. The county legislative authority, upon receipt of the proposed levels of assessment from the board, after a hearing, shall accept or modify by resolution, or refer back to the board for its reconsideration all or any portion of the proposed levels of assessment. The amount of the assessment constitutes a lien against the property. The county legislative authority may by resolution or ordinance require that notice of the lien be sent to each owner of property for which the assessment has not been paid by the date it was due and that each lien created be collected by the treasurer in the same manner as delinquent real property tax, if within thirty days from the date the owner is sent notice of the lien, including the amount thereof, the lien remains unpaid and an appeal has not been made pursuant to RCW 17.10.180. Liens treated as delinquent taxes bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum and the interest accrues as of the date notice of the lien is sent to the owner: PROVIDED FURTHER, That any collections for the lien shall not be considered as tax; or

      ii. The county legislative authority may appropriate money from the county general fund necessary for the administration of the county noxious weed control program. In addition the county legislative authority may make emergency appropriations as it deems necessary for the implementation of this chapter.

2. Forestlands used solely for the planting, growing, or harvesting of trees and which are typified, except during a single period of five years following clear-cut logging, by canopies so dense as to prohibit growth of an understory may be subject to an annual noxious weed assessment levied by a county legislative authority that does not exceed one-tenth of the weighted average per acre noxious weed assessment levied on all other lands in unincorporated areas within the county that are subject to the weed assessment. This assessment shall be computed in accordance with the formula in subsection (3) of this section.

3. The calculation of the "weighted average per acre noxious weed assessment" is a ratio expressed as follows:

   a. The numerator is the total amount of funds estimated to be collected from the per acre assessment on all lands except (i) forestlands as identified in subsection (2) of this section, (ii) lands exempt from the noxious weed assessment, and (iii) lands located in an incorporated area.

   b. The denominator is the total acreage from which funds in (a) of this subsection are collected. For lands of less than one acre in size, the denominator calculation may be based on the following assumptions: (i) Unimproved lands are calculated as being one-half acre in size on the average, and (ii) improved lands are calculated as being one-third acre in size on the average. The county legislative authority may choose to calculate the denominator for lands of less than one acre in size using other assumptions about average parcel size based on local information.

4. For those counties that levy a per parcel assessment to help fund noxious weed control programs, the per parcel assessment on forestlands as defined in subsection (2) of this section shall not exceed one-tenth of the per parcel assessment on nonforestlands.
