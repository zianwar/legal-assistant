## 78.56.010 - Intent.
It is in the best interests of the citizens of the state of Washington to insure the highest degree of environmental protection while allowing the proper development and use of its natural resources, including its mineral resources. Metals mining can have significant positive and adverse impacts on the state and on local communities. The purpose of this chapter is to assure that metals mineral mining or milling operations are designed, constructed, and operated in a manner that promotes both economic opportunities and environmental and public health safeguards for the citizens of the state. It is the intent of the legislature to create a regulatory framework which yields, to the greatest extent possible, a metals mining industry that is compatible with these policies.

## 78.56.130 - Legislative finding—Impact analysis required for large-scale operations—Impact fees by county legislative authority—Application of this section—Application of chapter  82.02 RCW.
1. The legislature finds that the construction and operation of large-scale metals mining and milling facilities may create new job opportunities and enhance local tax revenues. However, the legislature also finds that such operations may also result in new demands on public facilities owned and operated by local government entities, such as public streets and roads; publicly owned parks, open space, and recreation facilities; school facilities; and fire protection facilities in jurisdictions that are not part of a fire district. It is important for these economic impacts to be identified as part of any proposal for a large-scale metals mining and milling operation. It is then appropriate for the county legislative authority to balance expected revenues, including revenues derived from taxes paid by the owner of such an operation, and costs associated with the operation to determine to what degree any new costs require mitigation by the metals mining applicant.

2. An applicant for a large-scale metals mining and milling operation regulated under this chapter must submit to the relevant county legislative authority an impact analysis describing the economic impact of the proposed mining operation on local governmental units. For the purposes of this section, a metals mining operation is large-scale if, in the construction or operation of the mine and the associated milling facility, the applicant and contractors at the site employ more than thirty-five persons during any consecutive six-month period. The relevant county is the county in which the mine and mill are to be sited, unless the economic impacts to local governmental units are projected to substantially affect more than one county. In that case, the impact plan must be submitted to the legislative authority of all affected counties. Local governmental units include counties, cities, towns, school districts, and special purpose districts.

3. The economic impact analysis shall include at least the following information:

   a. A timetable for development of the mining operation, including the opening date of the operation and the estimated closing date;

   b. The estimated number of persons coming into the impacted area as a result of the development of the mining operation;

   c. An estimate of the increased capital and operating costs to local governmental units for providing services necessary as a result of the development of the mining operation; and

   d. An estimate of the increased tax or other revenues accruing to local governmental units as a result of development of the mining and milling operation.

4. The county legislative authority of a county planning under chapter 36.70A RCW may assess impact fees under chapter 82.02 RCW to address economic impacts associated with development of the mining operation. The county legislative authority shall hold at least one public hearing on the economic impact analysis and any proposed mitigation measures.

5. The county legislative authority of a county which is not planning under chapter 36.70A RCW may negotiate with the applicant on a strategy to address economic impacts associated with development of the mining operation. The county legislative authority shall hold at least one public hearing on the economic impact analysis and any proposed mitigation measures.

6. The county legislative authority must approve or disapprove the impact analysis and any associated proposals from the applicant to address economic impacts to local governmental units resulting from development of the mining operation. If the applicant does not submit an adequate impact analysis to the relevant county legislative authority or if the county legislative authority does not find the applicant's proposals to be acceptable because of their failure to adequately mitigate adverse economic impacts, the county legislative authority shall refuse to issue any permits under its jurisdiction necessary for the construction or operation of the mine and associated mill.

7. The requirements established in this section apply to metals mining operations under construction or constructed after April 1, 1994.

8. The provisions of chapter 82.02 RCW shall apply to new mining and milling operations.

## 78.56.140 - Citizen action suits.
1. Except as provided in subsections (2) and (5) of this section, any aggrieved person may commence a civil action on his or her own behalf:

   a. Against any person, including any state agency or local government agency, who is alleged to be in violation of a law, rule, order, or permit pertaining to metals mining and milling operations regulated under chapter 232, Laws of 1994;

   b. Against a state agency if there is alleged a failure of the agency to perform any nondiscretionary act or duty under state laws pertaining to metals mining and milling operations; or

   c. Against any person who constructs a metals mining and milling operation without the permits and authorizations required by state law.

The superior courts shall have jurisdiction to enforce metals mining laws, rules, orders, and permit conditions, or to order the state to perform such act or duty, as the case may be. In addition to injunctive relief, a superior court may award a civil penalty when deemed appropriate in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars per violation per day, payable to the state of Washington.

2. No action may be commenced:

   a. Under subsection (1)(a) of this section:

      i. Prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged violation to the state, and to any alleged violator of a metals mining and milling law, rule, order, or permit condition; or

      ii. If the state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a court of the state or of the United States or is diligently pursuing authorized administrative enforcement action to require compliance with the law, rule, order, or permit. To preclude a civil action, the enforcement action must contain specific, aggressive, and enforceable timelines for compliance and must provide for public notice of and reasonable opportunity for public comment on the enforcement action. In any such court action, any aggrieved person may intervene as a matter of right; or

   b. Under subsection (1)(b) of this section prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of such action to the state.

3. [Empty]

   a. Any action respecting a violation of a law, rule, order, or permit condition pertaining to metals mining and milling operations may be brought in the judicial district in which such operation is located or proposed.

   b. In such action under this section, the state, if not a party, may intervene as a matter of right.

4. The court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, may award costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, to any prevailing party, wherever the court determines such award is appropriate. The court may, if a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is sought, require the filing of a bond or equivalent security in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.

5. A civil action to enforce compliance with a law, rule, order, or permit may not be brought under this section if any other statute, or the common law, provides authority for the plaintiff to bring a civil action and, in such action, obtain the same relief, as authorized under this section, for enforcement of such law, rule, order, or permit. Nothing in this section restricts any right which any person, or class of persons, may have under any statute or common law to seek any relief, including relief against the state or a state agency.
