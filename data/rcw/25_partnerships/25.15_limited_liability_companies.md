In this regard, the court may consider the factors and policies set forth in established case law with regard to piercing the corporate veil, except that the failure to hold meetings of members or managers or the failure to observe formalities pertaining to the calling or conduct of meetings is not a factor tending to establish that the members have personal liability for any act, debt, obligation, or liability of the limited liability company if the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement do not expressly require the holding of meetings of members or managers.

If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, the member is obligated at the option of the limited liability company to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value of the contribution that has not been made. This option is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the limited liability company may have against such member under the limited liability company agreement or applicable law.

2. The obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this chapter may be compromised only by consent of all the members. Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit, after either the certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement or an amendment thereto, or records of the limited liability company reflect the obligation, and before the amendment of any thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reasonably relied on the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property to the limited liability company. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property to a limited liability company may not be enforced unless the conditions of the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such member. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited liability company prior to the time the call occurs.

3. A limited liability company agreement may provide that the interest of any member who fails to make any contribution that the member is obligated to make is subject to specified penalties for, or specified consequences of, such failure. Such penalty or consequence may take the form of reducing or eliminating the defaulting member's proportionate interest in a limited liability company, subordinating the member's limited liability company interest to that of nondefaulting members, a forced sale of the member's limited liability company interest, forfeiture of the member's limited liability company interest, the lending by other members of the amount necessary to meet the member's commitment, a fixing of the value of the member's limited liability company interest by appraisal or by formula and redemption or sale of the member's limited liability company interest at such value, or other penalty or consequence.

## 25.15.221 - Distribution in-kind.
A member, regardless of the nature of the member's contribution, has no right to receive any distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than money. A limited liability company may distribute an asset in kind to the extent that each member receives a percentage of the asset equal to the member's percentage share of distributions.

\[ [2015 c 188 § 44](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5030-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20188%20§%2044); \]

A limited liability company agreement may provide for the establishment of a record date with respect to allocations and distributions by a limited liability company. The limited liability company's obligation to make a distribution is subject to offset for any amount due and payable to the limited liability company by the person on whose account the distribution is made.

\[ [2015 c 188 § 45](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5030-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20188%20§%2045); \]

## 25.15.231 - Limitations on distribution.

2. A limited liability company must not make a distribution to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution (a) the limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they became due in the usual course of its activities, or (b) all liabilities of the limited liability company, other than liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of the limited liability company, exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited liability company, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited is included in the assets of the limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability.

3. A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (2) of this section on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.

4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7) of this section, the effect of a distribution under subsection (2) of this section is measured:

   a. In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a transferable interest in the limited liability company, as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the limited liability company; and

   b. In all other cases, as of the date:

      i. The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after that date; or

      ii. The payment is made, if payment occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the distribution is authorized.

5. A limited liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the limited liability company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors.

6. A limited liability company's indebtedness, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if the terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest are made only to the extent that a distribution could then be made to members under this section.

7. The effect of a distribution of indebtedness under subsection (2) of this section is measured:

   a. In the case of a distribution of indebtedness described in subsection (6) of this section, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made; and

   b. In the case of a distribution of any other indebtedness, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the date the indebtedness is distributed.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, a member of a member-managed limited liability company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability company that consents to a distribution made in violation of RCW 25.15.231 is personally liable to the limited liability company for the amount of the distribution that exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without the violation of RCW 25.15.231 if it is established that in consenting to the distribution the members or managers failed to comply with the duty of care.

2. To the extent the limited liability company agreement of a member-managed limited liability company expressly relieves a member of the authority and responsibility to consent to distributions and imposes that authority and responsibility on one or more other members, the liability provided in subsection (1) of this section applies to the other members and not the member that the limited liability company agreement relieves of authority and responsibility.

3. A member or transferee that received a distribution knowing that the distribution to that member or transferee was made in violation of RCW 25.15.231 is personally liable to the limited liability company but only to the extent that the distribution received by the member or transferee exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under RCW 25.15.231.

4. A member or manager against which an action is commenced under subsection (1) of this section may:

   a. Implead in the action any other person that is liable under subsection (1) of this section and compel contribution from the person; and

   b. Implead in the action any person that received a distribution in violation of subsection (3) of this section and compel contribution from the person in the amount the person received in violation of subsection (3) of this section.

5. An action under this section is barred if it is not commenced within two years after the distribution.

## 25.15.246 - Nature of limited liability company interest—Certificate of interest.
1. The only interest of a member that is transferable is the member's transferable interest. A transferable interest is personal property. A member has no interest in specific limited liability company property.

2. A limited liability company agreement may provide that a transferable interest may be evidenced by a certificate of limited liability company interest issued by the limited liability company and may also provide for the transfer of any transferable interest represented by such a certificate and make other provisions with respect to such certificate.

\[ [2015 c 188 § 48](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5030-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20188%20§%2048); \]

## 25.15.251 - Transfer of transferable interest.
1. A transfer, in whole or in part, of a transferable interest:

   a. Is permissible; and

   b. Does not, as against the members or the limited liability company, entitle the transferee to participate in the management of the limited liability company's activities, to require access to information concerning the limited liability company's transactions except as provided in subsection (5) of this section or in RCW 25.15.136(11), or to obtain access to information to which a member is otherwise entitled pursuant to RCW 25.15.136 or the limited liability company's other records.

2. A transfer of a transferable interest entitles the transferee to receive distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled, to the extent transferred.

3. Upon transfer of less than the transferor's entire transferable interest in the limited liability company, the transferor retains the rights, duties, and obligations of the transferor immediately prior to the transfer other than the transferable interest transferred.

4. Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection, a transferee that becomes a member with respect to a transferable interest is liable for the transferor's obligations with respect to the transferable interest. Except to the extent such liabilities are assumed by agreement:

   a. Until a transferee of a transferable interest becomes a member with respect to the transferable interest, the transferee has no liability as a member solely as a result of the transfer; and

   b. A transferee is not obligated for liabilities associated with a transferable interest that are unknown to the transferee at the time the transferee becomes a member.

5. In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee is entitled to an account of the limited liability company's transactions only from the date of dissolution.

6. For the purposes of this chapter:

   a. The pledge of, or granting of a security interest, lien, or other encumbrance in or against, any or all of a transferable interest is not a transfer of the transferable interest, but a foreclosure or execution sale or exercise of similar rights with respect to any or all of transferable interest is a transfer of the transferable interest to the transferee pursuant to such foreclosure or execution sale or exercise of similar rights.

   b. Where a transferable interest is held in a trust or estate, or is held by a trustee, personal representative, or other fiduciary, the transfer of the transferable interest, whether to a beneficiary of the trust or estate or otherwise, is a transfer of such transferable interest, but the mere substitution or replacement of the trustee, personal representative, or other fiduciary does not constitute a transfer of such transferable interest.

\[ [2015 c 188 § 49](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5030-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20188%20§%2049); \]

## 25.15.256 - Rights of judgment creditor.
1. On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member or transferee, the court may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of a transferee. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment creditor in respect of the limited liability company and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or that the circumstances of the case may require to give effect to the charging order.

2. A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's transferable interest. The court may order a foreclosure upon the transferable interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.

3. At any time before foreclosure, a transferable interest charged may be redeemed:

   a. By the judgment debtor;

   b. With property other than limited liability company property, by one or more of the other members; or

   c. With limited liability company property, by the limited liability company with the consent of all members whose interests are not so charged.

4. This chapter does not deprive any member or transferee of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member's or transferee's transferable interest.

5. This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's transferable interest.

\[ [2015 c 188 § 50](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5030-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20188%20§%2050); \]

## 25.15.265 - Dissolution.
A limited liability company is dissolved and its affairs must be wound up upon the first to occur of the following:

1. The dissolution date, if any, specified in the certificate of formation. If a dissolution date is specified in the certificate of formation, the certificate of formation may be amended and the date of dissolution of the limited liability company may be extended by vote of all the members;

2. The happening of events specified in a limited liability company agreement;

3. The written consent of all members;

4. Ninety days following an event of dissociation of the last remaining member, unless those having the rights of transferees in the limited liability company under RCW 25.15.131(1) have, by the ninetieth day, voted to admit one or more members, voting as though they were members, and in the manner set forth in RCW 25.15.121(1);

5. The entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under RCW 25.15.274; or

## 25.15.274 - Judicial dissolution.
On application by a member or manager the superior courts may order dissolution of a limited liability company whenever: (1) It is not reasonably practicable to carry on the limited liability company's activities in conformity with the certificate of formation and the limited liability company agreement; or (2) other circumstances render dissolution equitable.

\[ [2015 c 188 § 53](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5030-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20188%20§%2053); \]

## 25.15.294 - Voluntary dissolution—Revocation of dissolution—When effective—Effect.

2. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, revocation of dissolution must be approved in the same manner as the dissolution was approved unless that approval permitted revocation in some other manner, in which event the dissolution may be revoked in the manner permitted.

   b. If dissolution occurred upon the happening of events specified in the limited liability company agreement, revocation of dissolution must be approved in the manner necessary to amend the provisions of the limited liability company agreement specifying the events of dissolution.

   a. The name of the limited liability company and a statement that the name satisfies the requirements of Article 3 of chapter 23.95 RCW; if the name is not available, the limited liability company must deliver to the secretary of state for filing a certificate of amendment changing its name with the certificate of revocation of dissolution;

   b. As to which the dissolved limited liability company has knowledge of the identity and the mailing address of the holder of the claim or liability and, in the case of a matured and legally assertable claim or liability, actual knowledge of existing facts that either (i) could be asserted to give rise to, or (ii) indicate an intention by the holder to assert, such a matured claim or liability.

If there are sufficient assets, such claims and obligations must be paid in full and any such provision for payment made must be made in full. If there are insufficient assets, such claims and obligations must be paid or provided for according to their priority and, among claims and obligations of equal priority, ratably to the extent of assets available therefor.
