## 25.10.016 - Knowledge and notice.
1. A person knows a fact if the person has actual knowledge of it.

2. A person has notice of a fact if the person:

   a. Knows of it;

   b. Has received a notification of it;

   c. Has reason to know it exists from all of the facts known to the person at the time in question; or

   d. Has notice of it under subsection (3) or (4) of this section.

3. A certificate of limited partnership on file in the office of the secretary of state is notice that the partnership is a limited partnership and the persons designated in the certificate as general partners are general partners. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, the certificate is not notice of any other fact.

4. A person has notice of:

   a. Another person's dissociation as a general partner, ninety days after the effective date of an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership that states that the other person has dissociated or ninety days after the effective date of a statement of dissociation pertaining to the other person, whichever occurs first;

   b. A limited partnership's dissolution, ninety days after the effective date of an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership stating that the limited partnership is dissolved;

A person other than an individual exercises reasonable diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the individual conducting the transaction for the person and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Reasonable diligence does not require an individual acting for the person to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.

8. A general partner's knowledge, notice, or receipt of a notification of a fact relating to the limited partnership is effective immediately as knowledge of, notice to, or receipt of a notification by the limited partnership, except in the case of a fraud on the limited partnership committed by or with the consent of the general partner. A limited partner's knowledge, notice, or receipt of a notification of a fact relating to the limited partnership is not effective as knowledge of, notice to, or receipt of a notification by the limited partnership.

   b. The limited partner makes a demand in a record received by the limited partnership, describing with reasonable particularity the information sought and the purpose for seeking the information; and

   c. The information sought is directly connected to the limited partner's purpose.

   c. The person meets the requirements of subsection (2) of this section.

5. The limited partnership shall respond to a demand made pursuant to subsection (4) of this section in the same manner as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

6. If a limited partner dies, RCW 25.10.561 applies.

9. A limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner may exercise the rights under this section through an attorney or other agent. Any restriction imposed under subsection (7) of this section or by the partnership agreement applies both to the attorney or other agent and to the limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner.

\[ [2009 c 188 § 304](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20304); \]

## 25.10.341 - Limited duties of limited partners.

\[ [2009 c 188 § 305](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20305); \]

## 25.10.351 - Person erroneously believing self to be limited partner.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, a person that makes an investment in a business enterprise, and erroneously but in good faith believes that the person has become a limited partner in the enterprise, is not a general partner and is not liable for the enterprise's obligations by reason of making the investment, receiving distributions from the enterprise, or exercising any rights of or appropriate to a limited partner, if, on ascertaining the mistake, the person:

   a. Causes an appropriate certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or statement of correction to be signed and delivered to the secretary of state for filing; or

   b. Withdraws from future participation as an owner in the enterprise by signing and delivering to the secretary of state for filing a statement of withdrawal under this section.

2. A person that makes an investment described in subsection (1) of this section is liable to the same extent as a general partner to any third party that enters into a transaction with the enterprise, believing in good faith that the person is a general partner, before the secretary of state files a statement of withdrawal, certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or statement of correction to show that the person is not a general partner.

3. If a person makes a diligent effort in good faith to comply with subsection (1)(a) of this section and is unable to cause the appropriate certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or statement of correction to be signed and delivered to the secretary of state for filing, the person has the right to withdraw from the enterprise pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section even if the withdrawal would otherwise breach an agreement with others that are or have agreed to become co-owners of the enterprise.

A person becomes a general partner:

1. As provided in the partnership agreement;

\[ [2009 c 188 § 401](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20401); \]

## 25.10.381 - General partner agent of limited partnership.
1. Each general partner is an agent of the limited partnership for the purposes of its activities. An act of a general partner, including the signing of a record in the partnership's name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course of the limited partnership's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership, unless the general partner did not have authority to act for the limited partnership in the particular matter and the person with which the general partner was dealing knew, had received a notification, or had notice under RCW 25.10.016(4) that the general partner lacked authority.

2. An act of a general partner that is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course of the limited partnership's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners.

\[ [2009 c 188 § 402](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20402); \]

## 25.10.391 - Limited partnership liable for general partner's actionable conduct.
1. A limited partnership is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, or for a penalty incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a general partner acting in the ordinary course of activities of the limited partnership or with authority of the limited partnership.

2. If, in the course of the limited partnership's activities or while acting with authority of the limited partnership, a general partner receives or causes the limited partnership to receive money or property of a person not a partner, and the money or property is misapplied by a general partner, the limited partnership is liable for the loss.

\[ [2009 c 188 § 403](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20403); \]

1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, all general partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the limited partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.

3. An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. This subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership under RCW 25.10.421(2)(b).

\[ [2009 c 188 § 404](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20404); \]

## 25.10.411 - Actions by and against partnership and partners.
1. To the extent not inconsistent with RCW 25.10.401, a general partner may be joined in an action against the limited partnership or named in a separate action.

2. A judgment against a limited partnership is not by itself a judgment against a general partner. A judgment against a limited partnership may not be satisfied from a general partner's assets unless there is also a judgment against the general partner.

3. A judgment creditor of a general partner may not levy execution against the assets of the general partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the limited partnership, unless the partner is personally liable for the claim under RCW 25.10.401 and:

   a. A judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the limited partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part;

   b. The limited partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;

   c. The general partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust limited partnership assets;

   d. A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy execution against the assets of a general partner based on a finding that limited partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of limited partnership assets is excessively burdensome, or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court's equitable powers; or

   e. Liability is imposed on the general partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the limited partnership.

\[ [2009 c 188 § 405](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20405); \]

## 25.10.421 - Management rights of general partner.
1. Each general partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the limited partnership's activities. Except as expressly provided in this chapter, any matter relating to the activities of the limited partnership may be exclusively decided by the general partner or, if there is more than one general partner, by a majority of the general partners.

2. The consent of each partner is necessary to:

   a. Amend the partnership agreement;

   b. Amend the certificate of limited partnership to add or, subject to RCW 25.10.796, delete a statement that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership; and

   c. Sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of the limited partnership's property, with or without the good will, other than in the usual and regular course of the limited partnership's activities.

3. A limited partnership shall reimburse a general partner for payments made and indemnify a general partner for liabilities incurred by the general partner in the ordinary course of the activities of the partnership or for the preservation of its activities or property.

4. A limited partnership shall reimburse a general partner for an advance to the limited partnership beyond the amount of capital the general partner agreed to contribute.

5. A payment or advance made by a general partner that gives rise to an obligation of the limited partnership under subsection (3) or (4) of this section constitutes a loan to the limited partnership that accrues interest from the date of the payment or advance.

6. A general partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for the partnership.

\[ [2009 c 188 § 406](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20406); \]

   b. At a reasonable location specified by the limited partnership, any other records maintained by the limited partnership regarding the limited partnership's activities and financial condition.

2. Each general partner and the limited partnership shall furnish to a general partner:

   a. Without demand, any information concerning the limited partnership's activities and activities reasonably required for the proper exercise of the general partner's rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this chapter; and

   b. On demand, any other information concerning the limited partnership's activities, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.

3. Subject to subsection (5) of this section, on ten days' demand made in a record received by the limited partnership, a person dissociated as a general partner may have access to the information and records described in subsection (1) of this section at the location specified in subsection (1) of this section if:

   a. The information or record pertains to the period during which the person was a general partner;

   b. The person seeks the information or record in good faith; and

   c. The person satisfies the requirements imposed on a limited partner by RCW 25.10.331(2).

4. The limited partnership shall respond to a demand made pursuant to subsection (3) of this section in the same manner as provided in RCW 25.10.331(3).

5. If a general partner dies, RCW 25.10.561 applies.

6. The limited partnership may impose reasonable restrictions on the use of information under this section. In any dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the limited partnership has the burden of proving reasonableness.

7. A limited partnership may charge a person dissociated as a general partner that makes a demand under this section reasonable costs of copying, limited to the costs of labor and material.

8. A general partner or person dissociated as a general partner may exercise the rights under this section through an attorney or other agent. Any restriction imposed under subsection (6) of this section or by the partnership agreement applies both to the attorney or other agent and to the general partner or person dissociated as a general partner.

9. The rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee, but the rights under subsection (3) of this section of a person dissociated as a general partner may be exercised by the legal representative of an individual who dissociated as a general partner under RCW 25.10.521(7) (b) or (c).

\[ [2009 c 188 § 407](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1067-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20188%20§%20407); \]

   a. To account to the limited partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the general partner in the conduct and winding up of the limited partnership's activities or derived from a use by the general partner of limited partnership property, including the appropriation of a limited partnership opportunity;

   b. To refrain from dealing with the limited partnership in the conduct or winding up of the limited partnership's activities as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the limited partnership; and

   b. The limited partnership's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of the limited partnership, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability.

3. A limited partnership may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (2) of this section on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.

4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7) of this section, the effect of a distribution under subsection (2) of this section is measured:

      i. The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after that date; or

      ii. The payment is made, if payment occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the distribution is authorized.

5. A limited partnership's indebtedness to a partner incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the limited partnership's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors.

6. A limited partnership's indebtedness, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if the terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest are made only to the extent that a distribution could then be made to partners under this section.

7. The effect of a distribution of indebtedness under subsection (2) of this section is measured:

   a. In the case of a distribution of indebtedness described in subsection (6) of this section, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made; and

2. A partner or transferee that received a distribution knowing that the distribution to that partner or transferee was made in violation of RCW 25.10.496 is personally liable to the limited partnership but only to the extent that the distribution received by the partner or transferee exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under RCW 25.10.496.

   a. Implead in the action any other person that is liable under subsection (1) of this section and compel contribution from the person; and

Does not, as against the other partners or the limited partnership, entitle the transferee to participate in the management or conduct of the limited partnership's activities, to require access to information concerning the limited partnership's transactions except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, or to inspect or copy the required information or the limited partnership's other records.

2. A transferee has a right to receive, in accordance with the transfer:

   a. Distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; and

   b. Upon the dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership's activities the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor.

3. In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee is entitled to an account of the limited partnership's transactions only from the date of dissolution.

1. On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, the court may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of a transferee. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the partnership and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or that the circumstances of the case may require to give effect to the charging order.

2. A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's transferable interest. The court may order a foreclosure upon the interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.

3. At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be redeemed:

   a. By the judgment debtor;

   b. With property other than limited partnership property, by one or more of the other partners; or

   c. With limited partnership property, by the limited partnership with the consent of all partners whose interests are not so charged.

4. This chapter does not deprive any partner or transferee of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the partner's or transferee's transferable interest.

5. This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's transferable interest.

2. The consent of all general partners and of limited partners owning a majority of the rights to receive distributions as limited partners at the time the consent is to be effective;
