## 25.05.010 - Knowledge and notice.

Either filing has the effect provided in this chapter with respect to partnership property located in or transactions that occur in this state.

2. A statement delivered by a partnership to the secretary of state for filing must be executed by at least two partners.

4. A person who delivers a statement to the secretary of state for filing shall promptly send a copy of the statement to every nonfiling partner and to any other person named as a partner in the statement. Failure to send a copy of a statement to a partner or other person does not limit the effectiveness of the statement as to a person not a partner.

## 25.05.055 - Formation of partnership.

3. In determining whether a partnership is formed, the following rules apply:

An act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument in the partnership name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner had no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner was dealing knew or had received a notification that the partner lacked authority.

2. An act of a partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership only if the act was authorized by the other partners.

   b. Partnership property held in the name of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held; or

   c. Partnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

2. A partnership may recover partnership property from a transferee only if it proves that execution of the instrument of initial transfer did not bind the partnership under RCW 25.05.100, and:

   a. As to a subsequent transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section, proves that the subsequent transferee knew or had received a notification that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership; or

   b. As to a transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection (1)(c) of this section, proves that the transferee knew or had received a notification that the property was partnership property and that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.

3. A partnership may not recover partnership property from a subsequent transferee if the partnership would not have been entitled to recover the property, under subsection (2) of this section, from any earlier transferee of the property.

4. If a person holds all of the partners' interests in the partnership, all of the partnership property vests in that person. The person may execute a document in the name of the partnership to evidence vesting of the property in that person and may file or record the document.

## 25.05.110 - Statement of partnership authority.
1. A partnership may deliver to the secretary of state for filing a statement of partnership authority, which:

   a. Must include:

      i. The name of the partnership; and

      ii. The street address of its chief executive office and of one office in this state, if there is one; and

2. A grant of authority contained in a filed statement of partnership authority is conclusive in favor of a person not a partner who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not then contained in a subsequently filed statement. A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.

3. A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if the limitation is contained in a filed statement of partnership authority.

4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section and RCW 25.05.265 and 25.05.320, a person not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed statement.

5. Unless earlier canceled, a filed statement of partnership authority is canceled by operation of law five years after the date on which the statement, or the most recent amendment, was filed by the secretary of state.

## 25.05.115 - Statement of denial.
A partner, or other person named as a partner in a filed statement of partnership authority, may deliver to the secretary of state for filing a statement of denial stating the name of the partnership and the fact that is being denied, which may include denial of a person's authority or status as a partner. A statement of denial is a limitation on authority as provided in RCW 25.05.110 (2) and (3).

\[ [2015 c 176 § 5104](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5387.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20176%20§%205104); [1998 c 103 § 304](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20304); \]

\[ [1998 c 103 § 305](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20305); \]

## 25.05.125 - Partner's liability.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section, all partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.

2. A person admitted as a partner into an existing partnership is not personally liable for any partnership obligation incurred before the person's admission as a partner.

3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, an obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner. This subsection applies notwithstanding anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed, in the case of a limited liability partnership in existence on June 11, 1998, and, in the case of a partnership becoming a limited liability partnership after June 11, 1998, immediately before the vote required to become a limited liability partnership under RCW 25.05.500(1).

4. If the partners of a limited liability partnership or a foreign limited liability partnership are required to be licensed to provide professional services as defined in RCW 18.100.030, and the partnership fails to maintain for itself and for its members practicing in this state a policy of professional liability insurance, bond, deposit in trust, bank escrow of cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States treasury obligations, bank letter of credit, insurance company bond, or other evidence of financial responsibility of a kind designated by rule by the state insurance commissioner and in the amount of at least one million dollars or such greater amount, not to exceed three million dollars, as the state insurance commissioner may establish by rule for a licensed profession or for any specialty within a profession, taking into account the nature and size of the businesses within the profession or specialty, then the partners shall be personally liable to the extent that, had such insurance, bond, deposit in trust, bank escrow of cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States treasury obligations, bank letter of credit, insurance company bond, or other evidence of responsibility been maintained, it would have covered the liability in question.

\[ [1998 c 103 § 306](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20306); \]

## 25.05.130 - Actions by and against partnership and partners.
1. A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership.

2. An action may be brought against the partnership and, to the extent not inconsistent with RCW 25.05.125, any or all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions.

3. A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied from a partner's assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.

4. A judgment creditor of a partner may not levy execution against the assets of the partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the partnership unless the partner is personally liable for the claim under RCW 25.05.125, and:

   a. A judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part;

   b. The partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;

   c. The partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust partnership assets;

   d. A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy execution against the assets of a partner based on a finding that partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of partnership assets is excessively burdensome, or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court's equitable powers; or

   e. Liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the partnership.

5. This section applies to any partnership liability or obligation resulting from a representation by a partner or purported partner under RCW 25.05.135.

## 25.05.135 - Liability of purported partner.
1. If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner's consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.

2. If a person is thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.

3. A person is not liable as a partner merely because the person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority.

4. A person does not continue to be liable as a partner merely because of a failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of partnership authority to indicate the partner's dissociation from the partnership.

5. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, persons who are not partners as to each other are not liable as partners to other persons.

\[ [1998 c 103 § 308](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20308); \]

## 25.05.150 - Partner's rights and duties.

   b. Charged with an amount equal to the money plus the value of any other property, net of the amount of any liabilities, distributed by the partnership to the partner and the partner's share of the partnership losses.

2. Each partner is entitled to an equal share of the partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the partner's share of the profits.

10. A difference arising as to a matter in the ordinary course of business of a partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners. An act outside the ordinary course of business of a partnership and an amendment to the partnership agreement may be undertaken only with the consent of all of the partners.

11. This section does not affect the obligations of a partnership to other persons under RCW 25.05.100.

\[ [1998 c 103 § 401](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20401); \]

## 25.05.165 - General standards of partner's conduct.

\[ [1998 c 103 § 404](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20404); \]

\[ [1998 c 103 § 602](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20602); \]

## 25.05.250 - Purchase of dissociated partner's interest.
1. If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under RCW 25.05.300, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner's interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.

2. The buyout price of a dissociated partner's interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under RCW 25.05.330(2) if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership were wound up as of that date. Interest must be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.

3. Damages for wrongful dissociation under RCW 25.05.230(2), and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, must be offset against the buyout price. Interest must be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.

4. A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under RCW 25.05.255.

5. If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner's interest is reached within one hundred twenty days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection (3) of this section.

6. If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8) of this section, the partnership may tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection (3) of this section, stating the time of payment, the amount and type of security for payment, and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.

7. The payment or tender required by subsection (5) or (6) of this section must be accompanied by the following:

   a. A statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation;

   b. The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any;

   c. An explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated; and

   d. Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within one hundred twenty days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection (3) of this section, or other terms of the obligation to purchase.

8. A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment must be adequately secured and bear interest.

9. A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to RCW 25.05.170(2)(b)(ii), to determine the buyout price of that partner's interest, any offsets under subsection (3) of this section, or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within one hundred twenty days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner's interest, any offset due under subsection (3) of this section, and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8) of this section, the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection (7) of this section.

## 25.05.255 - Dissociated partner's power to bind and liability to partnership.
1. For two years after a partner dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, the partnership, including a surviving partnership under article 9 of this chapter, is bound by an act of the dissociated partner which would have bound the partnership under RCW 25.05.100 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

   a. Reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner;

   b. Did not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and

   c. Is not deemed to have had knowledge under RCW 25.05.110(3) or notice under RCW 25.05.265(3).

## 25.05.260 - Dissociated partner's liability to other persons.
1. A partner's dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner's liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section.

2. A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership, or a surviving partnership under article 9 of this chapter, within two years after the partner's dissociation, only if the partner is liable for the obligation under RCW 25.05.125 and at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

   a. Reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner;

   b. Did not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and

   c. Is not deemed to have had knowledge under RCW 25.05.110(3) or notice under RCW 25.05.265(3).

3. By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.

4. A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.

3. For the purposes of RCW 25.05.255(1)(c) and 25.05.260(2)(c), a person not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety days after the statement of dissociation is filed.

\[ [1998 c 103 § 704](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20704); \]

## 25.05.270 - Continued use of partnership name.
Continued use of a partnership name, or a dissociated partner's name as part thereof, by partners continuing the business does not of itself make the dissociated partner liable for an obligation of the partners or the partnership continuing the business.

\[ [1998 c 103 § 705](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2386-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20103%20§%20705); \]

2. In a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking:

   a. Within ninety days after a partner's dissociation by death or otherwise under RCW 25.05.225 (6) through (10) or wrongful dissociation under RCW 25.05.230(2) if a majority of the remaining partners decide to wind up the partnership business, and for purposes of this subsection a partner's rightful dissociation pursuant to RCW 25.05.230(2)(b)(i) constitutes the expression of that partner's will to wind up the partnership business;

   b. The express will of all of the partners to wind up the partnership business; or

   c. The expiration of the term or the completion of the undertaking;

3. An event agreed to in the partnership agreement resulting in the winding up of the partnership business;

   c. It is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the partnership business in conformity with the partnership agreement; or

6. On application by a transferee of a partner's transferable interest, a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business:

In that event:

   a. The partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never occurred; and

   b. The rights of a third party accruing under RCW 25.05.315(1) or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver may not be adversely affected.
