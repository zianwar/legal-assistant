## 9.94B.010 - Application of chapter.
1. This chapter codifies sentencing provisions that may be applicable to sentences for crimes committed prior to July 1, 2000.

2. This chapter supplements chapter 9.94A RCW and should be read in conjunction with that chapter.

\[ [2008 c 231 § 51](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2719.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20231%20§%2051); \]

## 9.94B.020 - Definitions.
In addition to the definitions set out in RCW 9.94A.030, the following definitions apply for purposes of this chapter:

1. "Community placement" means that period during which the offender is subject to the conditions of community custody and/or postrelease supervision, which begins either upon completion of the term of confinement (postrelease supervision) or at such time as the offender is transferred to community custody in lieu of earned release. Community placement may consist of entirely community custody, entirely postrelease supervision, or a combination of the two.

2. "Community supervision" means a period of time during which a convicted offender is subject to crime-related prohibitions and other sentence conditions imposed by a court pursuant to this chapter or RCW * 16.52.200(6) or 46.61.524. Where the court finds that any offender has a chemical dependency that has contributed to his or her offense, the conditions of supervision may, subject to available resources, include treatment. For purposes of the interstate compact for out-of-state supervision of parolees and probationers, RCW 9.95.270, community supervision is the functional equivalent of probation and should be considered the same as probation by other states.

3. "Postrelease supervision" is that portion of an offender's community placement that is not community custody.

\[ [2008 c 231 § 52](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2719.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20231%20§%2052); \]

## 9.94B.030 - Postrelease supervision—Violations—Expenses.
If the offender violates any condition of postrelease supervision, a hearing may be conducted in the same manner as provided in RCW 9.94B.040. Jurisdiction shall be with the court of the county in which the offender was sentenced. However, the court may order a change of venue to the offender's county of residence or where the violation occurred, for the purpose of holding a violation hearing.

After the hearing, the court may order the offender to be confined for up to sixty days per violation in the county jail. Reimbursement to a city or county for the care of offenders who are detained solely for violating a condition of postrelease supervision shall be under RCW 70.48.440. A county shall be reimbursed for indigent defense costs for offenders who are detained solely for violating a condition of postrelease supervision in accordance with regulations to be promulgated by the office of financial management. An offender may be held in jail at state expense pending the hearing, and any time served while awaiting the hearing shall be credited against confinement imposed for a violation. The court shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of holding the violation hearing and imposing a sanction.

\[ [2009 c 28 § 18](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5190-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%2028%20§%2018); [1988 c 153 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c153.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20153%20§%208); \]

## 9.94B.040 - Noncompliance with condition or requirement of sentence—Procedure—Penalty. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. If an offender violates any condition or requirement of a sentence, the court may modify its order of judgment and sentence and impose further punishment in accordance with this section.

2. In cases where conditions from a second or later sentence of community supervision begin prior to the term of the second or later sentence, the court shall treat a violation of such conditions as a violation of the sentence of community supervision currently being served.

3. If an offender fails to comply with any of the nonfinancial requirements or conditions of a sentence the following provisions apply:

   a. [Empty]

      i. Following the violation, if the offender and the department make a stipulated agreement, the department may impose sanctions such as work release, home detention with electronic monitoring, work crew, community restitution, inpatient treatment, daily reporting, curfew, educational or counseling sessions, supervision enhanced through electronic monitoring, jail time, or other sanctions available in the community.

      ii. Within seventy-two hours of signing the stipulated agreement, the department shall submit a report to the court and the prosecuting attorney outlining the violation or violations, and sanctions imposed. Within fifteen days of receipt of the report, if the court is not satisfied with the sanctions, the court may schedule a hearing and may modify the department's sanctions. If this occurs, the offender may withdraw from the stipulated agreement.

      iii. If the offender fails to comply with the sanction administratively imposed by the department, the court may take action regarding the original noncompliance. Offender failure to comply with the sanction administratively imposed by the department may be considered an additional violation;

   b. In the absence of a stipulated agreement, or where the court is not satisfied with the department's sanctions as provided in (a) of this subsection, the court, upon the motion of the state, or upon its own motion, shall require the offender to show cause why the offender should not be punished for the noncompliance. The court may issue a summons or a warrant of arrest for the offender's appearance;

   c. The state has the burden of showing noncompliance by a preponderance of the evidence. If the court finds that the violation has occurred, it may order the offender to be confined for a period not to exceed sixty days for each violation, and may (i) convert a term of partial confinement to total confinement, (ii) convert community restitution obligation to total or partial confinement, or (iii) order one or more of the penalties authorized in (a)(i) of this subsection. Any time served in confinement awaiting a hearing on noncompliance shall be credited against any confinement order by the court;

   d. If the court finds that the violation was not willful, the court may modify its previous order regarding community restitution obligations; and

   e. If the violation involves a failure to undergo or comply with mental status evaluation and/or outpatient mental health treatment, the community corrections officer shall consult with the treatment provider or proposed treatment provider. Enforcement of orders concerning outpatient mental health treatment must reflect the availability of treatment and must pursue the least restrictive means of promoting participation in treatment. If the offender's failure to receive care essential for health and safety presents a risk of serious physical harm or probable harmful consequences, the civil detention and commitment procedures of chapter 71.05 RCW shall be considered in preference to incarceration in a local or state correctional facility.

4. If the violation involves failure to pay legal financial obligations, the following provisions apply:

   a. The department and the offender may enter into a stipulated agreement that the failure to pay was willful noncompliance, according to the provisions and requirements of subsection (3)(a) of this section;

   b. In the absence of a stipulated agreement, or where the court is not satisfied with the department's sanctions as provided in a stipulated agreement under (a) of this subsection, the court, upon the motion of the state, or upon its own motion, shall require the offender to show cause why the offender should not be punished for the noncompliance. The court may issue a summons or a warrant of arrest for the offender's appearance;

   c. The state has the burden of showing noncompliance by a preponderance of the evidence. The court may not sanction the offender for failure to pay legal financial obligations unless the court finds, after a hearing and on the record, that the failure to pay is willful. A failure to pay is willful if the offender has the current ability to pay but refuses to do so. In determining whether the offender has the current ability to pay, the court shall inquire into and consider: (i) The offender's income and assets; (ii) the offender's basic living costs as defined by RCW 10.101.010 and other liabilities including child support and other legal financial obligations; and (iii) the offender's bona fide efforts to acquire additional resources. An offender who is indigent as defined by RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c) is presumed to lack the current ability to pay;

   d. If the court determines that the offender is homeless or a person who is mentally ill, as defined in RCW 71.24.025, failure to pay a legal financial obligation is not willful noncompliance and shall not subject the offender to penalties;

   e. If the court finds that the failure to pay is willful noncompliance, the court may order the offender to be confined for a period not to exceed sixty days for each violation or order one or more of the penalties authorized in subsection (3)(a)(i) of this section; and

   f. If the court finds that the violation was not willful, the court may, and if the court finds that the defendant is indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c), the court shall modify the terms of payment of the legal financial obligations, reduce or waive nonrestitution legal financial obligations, or convert nonrestitution legal financial obligations to community restitution hours, if the jurisdiction operates a community restitution program, at the rate of no less than the state minimum wage established in RCW 49.46.020 for each hour of community restitution. The crime victim penalty assessment under RCW 7.68.035 may not be reduced, waived, or converted to community restitution hours.

5. The community corrections officer may obtain information from the offender's mental health treatment provider on the offender's status with respect to evaluation, application for services, registration for services, and compliance with the supervision plan, without the offender's consent, as described under *RCW 71.05.630.

6. An offender under community placement or community supervision who is civilly detained under chapter 71.05 RCW, and subsequently discharged or conditionally released to the community, shall be under the supervision of the department of corrections for the duration of his or her period of community placement or community supervision. During any period of inpatient mental health treatment that falls within the period of community placement or community supervision, the inpatient treatment provider and the supervising community corrections officer shall notify each other about the offender's discharge, release, and legal status, and shall share other relevant information.

7. Nothing in this section prohibits the filing of escape charges if appropriate.

## 9.94B.050 - Community placement.

   a. A sex offense or a serious violent offense committed after July 1, 1988, but before July 1, 1990; or

      i. Assault in the second degree;

      ii. Assault of a child in the second degree;

      iii. A crime against persons where it is determined in accordance with RCW 9.94A.825 that the offender or an accomplice was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of commission; or

3.

Any period of community custody actually served shall be credited against the community placement portion of the sentence. The community placement shall run concurrently to any period of probation, parole, community supervision, community placement, or community custody previously imposed by any court in any jurisdiction, unless the court pronouncing the current sentence expressly orders that they be served consecutively to each other.

4. Unless a condition is waived by the court, the terms of any community placement imposed under this section shall include the following conditions:

   a. The offender shall report to and be available for contact with the assigned community corrections officer as directed;

   b. The offender shall work at department-approved education, employment, or community restitution, or any combination thereof;

7. Prior to or during community placement, upon recommendation of the department, the sentencing court may remove or modify any conditions of community placement so as not to be more restrictive.

## 9.94B.060 - Community placement for specified offenders.
Except for persons sentenced under RCW 9.94B.050(2) or 9.94B.070, when a court sentences a person to a term of total confinement to the custody of the department for a violent offense, any crime against persons under RCW 9.94A.411(2), or any felony offense under chapter 69.50 or 69.52 RCW not sentenced under RCW 9.94A.660, committed on or after July 25, 1999, but before July 1, 2000, the court shall in addition to the other terms of the sentence, sentence the offender to a one-year term of community placement beginning either upon completion of the term of confinement or at such time as the offender is transferred to community custody in lieu of earned release in accordance with *RCW 9.94A.728 (1) and (2). When the court sentences the offender under this section to the statutory maximum period of confinement, then the community placement portion of the sentence shall consist entirely of such community custody to which the offender may become eligible, in accordance with *RCW 9.94A.728 (1) and (2).

## 9.94B.070 - Community custody for sex offenders.
1. When a court sentences a person to the custody of the department for an offense categorized as a sex offense, including those sex offenses also included in other offense categories, committed on or after June 6, 1996, and before July 1, 2000, the court shall, in addition to other terms of the sentence, sentence the offender to community custody for three years or up to the period of earned release awarded pursuant to RCW 9.94A.728, whichever is longer. The community custody shall begin either upon completion of the term of confinement or at such time as the offender is transferred to community custody in lieu of earned release.

2. Unless a condition is waived by the court, the terms of community custody imposed under this section shall be the same as those provided for in RCW 9.94B.050(4) and may include those provided for in RCW 9.94B.050(5). As part of any sentence that includes a term of community custody imposed under this section, the court shall also require the offender to comply with any conditions imposed by the department under RCW 9.94A.704.

3. At any time prior to the completion of a sex offender's term of community custody, if the court finds that public safety would be enhanced, the court may impose and enforce an order extending any or all of the conditions imposed pursuant to this section for a period up to the maximum allowable sentence for the crime as it is classified in chapter 9A.20 RCW, regardless of the expiration of the offender's term of community custody. If a violation of a condition extended under this subsection occurs after the expiration of the offender's term of community custody, it shall be deemed a violation of the sentence for the purposes of RCW 9.94A.631 and may be punishable as contempt of court as provided for in RCW 7.21.040.

\[ [2009 c 28 § 20](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5190-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%2028%20§%2020); [2000 c 28 § 24](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6223.SL.pdf?cite=2000%20c%2028%20§%2024); \]

## 9.94B.080 - Mental status evaluations.
The court may order an offender whose sentence includes community placement or community supervision to undergo a mental status evaluation and to participate in available outpatient mental health treatment, if the court finds that reasonable grounds exist to believe that the offender is a mentally ill person as defined in RCW 71.24.025, and that this condition is likely to have influenced the offense. An order requiring mental status evaluation or treatment may be based on a presentence report and, if applicable, mental status evaluations that have been filed with the court to determine the offender's competency or eligibility for a defense of insanity. The court may order additional evaluations at a later date if deemed appropriate.

For those individuals who, as a condition and term of their sentence imposed on or before July 1, 1989, have had financial obligations imposed, and who are not in compliance with the court order requiring payment of that legal financial obligation, no action shall be brought before the court from July 1, 1989, through and including December 31, 1989, to impose a penalty for their failure to pay.
