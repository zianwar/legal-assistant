To meet the statutory obligations of the indeterminate sentence review board, the number of board members shall not be reduced to fewer than three members, although the office of financial management may designate some or all members as part-time members and specify the extent to which they shall be less than full-time members. Any reduction shall take place by the expiration, on that date, of the term or terms having the least time left to serve.

2. After July 1, 1984, the board shall continue its functions with respect to persons convicted of crimes committed prior to July 1, 1984, and committed to the department of corrections. When making decisions on duration of confinement, including those relating to persons committed under a mandatory life sentence, and parole release under RCW 9.95.100 and 9.95.110, the board shall consider the purposes, standards, and sentencing ranges under chapter 9.94A RCW of the sentencing reform act and the minimum term recommendations of the sentencing judge and prosecuting attorney, and shall attempt to make decisions reasonably consistent with those ranges, standards, purposes, and recommendations: PROVIDED, That the board and its successors shall give adequate written reasons whenever a minimum term or parole release decision is made which is outside the sentencing ranges under chapter 9.94A RCW of the sentencing reform act. In making such decisions, the board and its successors shall consider the different charging and disposition practices under the indeterminate sentencing system.

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, the indeterminate sentence review board shall give public safety considerations the highest priority when making all discretionary decisions on the remaining indeterminate population regarding the ability for parole, parole release, and conditions of parole.

When a person, whose crime was committed before July 1, 1984, is convicted of any felony, except treason, murder in the first degree, or carnal knowledge of a child under ten years, and a new trial is not granted, the court shall sentence such person to the penitentiary, or, if the law allows and the court sees fit to exercise such discretion, to the reformatory, and shall fix the maximum term of such person's sentence only.

The maximum term to be fixed by the court shall be the maximum provided by law for the crime of which such person was convicted, if the law provides for a maximum term. If the law does not provide a maximum term for the crime of which such person was convicted the court shall fix such maximum term, which may be for any number of years up to and including life imprisonment but in any case where the maximum term is fixed by the court it shall be fixed at not less than twenty years.

1. When the court commits a convicted person to the department of corrections on or after July 1, 1986, for an offense committed before July 1, 1984, the court shall, at the time of sentencing or revocation of probation, fix the minimum term. The term so fixed shall not exceed the maximum sentence provided by law for the offense of which the person is convicted.

The court shall attempt to set the minimum term reasonably consistent with the purposes, standards, and sentencing ranges under chapter 9.94A RCW of the sentencing reform act, but the court is subject to the same limitations as those placed on the board under RCW 9.92.090, 9.95.040 (1) through (4), 9.95.115, 9A.32.040, 9A.44.045, and chapter 69.50 RCW. The court's minimum term decision is subject to review to the same extent as a minimum term decision by the parole board before July 1, 1986.

Thereafter, the expiration of the minimum term set by the court minus any time credits earned under RCW 9.95.070 and 9.95.110 constitutes the parole eligibility review date, at which time the board may consider the convicted person for parole under RCW 9.95.100 and 9.95.110 and chapter 72.04A RCW. Nothing in this section affects the board's authority to reduce or increase the minimum term, once set by the court, under RCW 9.95.040, 9.95.052, 9.95.055, 9.95.070, 9.95.080, 9.95.100, 9.95.115, 9.95.125, or 9.95.047.

If the board does not release the person, it shall set a new minimum term not to exceed an additional five years. The board shall review the person again not less than ninety days prior to the expiration of the new minimum term.

   b. If at the time a person sentenced under RCW 9.94A.507 for a sex offense committed on or after September 1, 2001, arrives at a department of corrections facility, the offender's minimum term has expired or will expire within one hundred twenty days of the offender's arrival, then no later than one hundred twenty days after the offender's arrival at a department of corrections facility, but after the board receives the results from the end of sentence review process and the recommendations for additional or modified conditions of community custody from the department, the board shall review the person for conditional release to community custody as provided in RCW 9.95.420. If the board does not release the person, it shall set a new minimum term not to exceed an additional five years. The board shall review the person again not less than ninety days prior to the expiration of the new minimum term.

   c. In setting a new minimum term, the board may consider the length of time necessary for the offender to complete treatment and programming as well as other factors that relate to the offender's release under RCW 9.95.420. The board's rules shall permit an offender to petition for an earlier review if circumstances change or the board receives new information that would warrant an earlier review.

RCW 9.94A.535(1)(h) provides that the sentencing court may consider as a mitigating factor evidence that the defendant or the defendant's children suffered a continuing pattern of physical or sexual abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense was a response to that abuse;

   b. RCW 9.94A.535(1)(h), if effective when the defendant committed the crime, would have provided a basis for the defendant to seek a mitigated sentence; and

   c. The sentencing court when determining what sentence to impose, did not consider evidence that the victim subjected the defendant or the defendant's children to a continuing pattern of sexual or physical abuse and the murder was in response to that abuse.

2. An inmate who seeks to have his or her sentence reviewed under this section must petition the board for review no later than October 1, 1993. The petition may be by letter requesting review.

If the inmate was sentenced pursuant to chapter 9.94A RCW for a murder committed after June 30, 1984, but before July 23, 1989, the board shall conduct the review and may make appropriate recommendations to the sentencing court as provided in RCW 9.94A.890. The board shall complete its review of the petitions and submit recommendations to the sentencing courts or their successors by October 1, 1994.

## 9.95.047 - Abused victim—Considerations of board in reviewing petition.
1. If an inmate under the board's jurisdiction files a petition for review under RCW 9.95.045, the board shall review the duration of the inmate's confinement, including review of the minimum term and parole eligibility review dates. The board shall consider whether:

   a. The petitioner was convicted for a murder committed prior to the effective date of RCW 9.94A.535(1)(h);

   b. RCW 9.94A.535(1)(h), if effective when the petitioner committed the crime, would have provided a basis for the petitioner to seek a mitigated sentence; and

## 9.95.120 - Suspension, revision of parole—Community corrections officers—Hearing—Retaking violators—Reinstatement.
Whenever the board or a community corrections officer of this state has reason to believe a person convicted of a crime committed before July 1, 1984, has breached a condition of his or her parole or violated the law of any state where he or she may then be or the rules and regulations of the board, any community corrections officer of this state may arrest or cause the arrest and detention and suspension of parole of such convicted person pending a determination by the board whether the parole of such convicted person shall be revoked. All facts and circumstances surrounding the violation by such convicted person shall be reported to the board by the community corrections officer, with recommendations. The board, after consultation with the secretary of corrections, shall make all rules and regulations concerning procedural matters, which shall include the time when state community corrections officers shall file with the board reports required by this section, procedures pertaining thereto and the filing of such information as may be necessary to enable the board to perform its functions under this section. On the basis of the report by the community corrections officer, or at any time upon its own discretion, the board may revise or modify the conditions of parole or order the suspension of parole by the issuance of a written order bearing its seal, which order shall be sufficient warrant for all peace officers to take into custody any convicted person who may be on parole and retain such person in their custody until arrangements can be made by the board for his or her return to a state correctional institution for convicted felons. Any such revision or modification of the conditions of parole or the order suspending parole shall be personally served upon the parolee.

Any parolee arrested and detained in physical custody by the authority of a state community corrections officer, or upon the written order of the board, shall not be released from custody on bail or personal recognizance, except upon approval of the board and the issuance by the board of an order of reinstatement on parole on the same or modified conditions of parole.

All chiefs of police, marshals of cities and towns, sheriffs of counties, and all police, prison, and peace officers and constables shall execute any such order in the same manner as any ordinary criminal process.

Whenever a paroled prisoner is accused of a violation of his or her parole, other than the commission of, and conviction for, a felony or misdemeanor under the laws of this state or the laws of any state where he or she may then be, he or she shall be entitled to a fair and impartial hearing of such charges within thirty days from the time that he or she is served with charges of the violation of conditions of parole after his or her arrest and detention. The hearing shall be held before one or more members of the board at a place or places, within this state, reasonably near the site of the alleged violation or violations of parole.

In the event that the board suspends a parole by reason of an alleged parole violation or in the event that a parole is suspended pending the disposition of a new criminal charge, the board shall have the power to nullify the order of suspension and reinstate the individual to parole under previous conditions or any new conditions that the board may determine advisable. Before the board shall nullify an order of suspension and reinstate a parole they shall have determined that the best interests of society and the individual shall best be served by such reinstatement rather than a return to a correctional institution.

2. A county legislative authority may assume responsibility for the supervision of defendants within its jurisdiction who have been convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor and sentenced to probation by a superior court.

## 9.95.210 - Conditions of probation. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection in granting probation, the superior court may suspend the imposition or the execution of the sentence and may direct that the suspension may continue upon such conditions and for such time as it shall designate, not exceeding the maximum term of sentence or two years, whichever is longer.

   b. For a defendant sentenced for a domestic violence offense, or under RCW 46.61.5055, the superior court may suspend the imposition or the execution of the sentence and may direct that the suspension continue upon such conditions and for such time as the court shall designate, not to exceed five years. The court shall have continuing jurisdiction and authority to suspend the execution of all or any part of the sentence upon stated terms, including installment payment of fines. A defendant who has been sentenced, and who then fails to appear for any hearing to address the defendant's compliance with the terms of probation when ordered to do so by the court shall have the term of probation tolled until such time as the defendant makes his or her presence known to the court on the record. Any time before entering an order terminating probation, the court may modify or revoke its order suspending the imposition or execution of the sentence if the defendant violates or fails to carry out any of the conditions of the suspended sentence.

2. In the order granting probation and as a condition thereof, the superior court may in its discretion imprison the defendant in the county jail for a period not exceeding one year and may fine the defendant any sum not exceeding the statutory limit for the offense committed, and court costs. As a condition of probation, the superior court shall require the payment of the penalty assessment required by RCW 7.68.035. The superior court may also require the defendant to make such monetary payments, on such terms as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, as are necessary: (a) To comply with any order of the court for the payment of family support; (b) to make restitution to any person or persons who may have suffered loss or damage by reason of the commission of the crime in question or when the offender pleads guilty to a lesser offense or fewer offenses and agrees with the prosecutor's recommendation that the offender be required to pay restitution to a victim of an offense or offenses which are not prosecuted pursuant to a plea agreement; (c) to pay such fine as may be imposed and court costs, including reimbursement of the state for costs of extradition if return to this state by extradition was required; (d) following consideration of the financial condition of the person subject to possible electronic monitoring, to pay for the costs of electronic monitoring if that monitoring was required by the court as a condition of release from custody or as a condition of probation; (e) to contribute to a county or interlocal drug fund; and (f) to make restitution to a public agency for the costs of an emergency response under RCW 38.52.430, and may require bonds for the faithful observance of any and all conditions imposed in the probation.

3. The superior court shall order restitution in all cases where the victim is entitled to benefits under the crime victims' compensation act, chapter 7.68 RCW. If the superior court does not order restitution and the victim of the crime has been determined to be entitled to benefits under the crime victims' compensation act, the department of labor and industries, as administrator of the crime victims' compensation program, may petition the superior court within one year of imposition of the sentence for entry of a restitution order. Upon receipt of a petition from the department of labor and industries, the superior court shall hold a restitution hearing and shall enter a restitution order.

4. In granting probation, the superior court may order the probationer to report to the secretary of corrections or such officer as the secretary may designate and as a condition of the probation to follow the instructions of the secretary for up to twelve months. If the county legislative authority has elected to assume responsibility for the supervision of superior court misdemeanant probationers within its jurisdiction, the superior court misdemeanant probationer shall report to a probation officer employed or contracted for by the county. In cases where a superior court misdemeanant probationer is sentenced in one county, but resides within another county, there must be provisions for the probationer to report to the agency having supervision responsibility for the probationer's county of residence.

5. If the probationer has been ordered to make restitution and the superior court has ordered supervision, the officer supervising the probationer shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain whether restitution has been made. If the superior court has ordered supervision and restitution has not been made as ordered, the officer shall inform the prosecutor of that violation of the terms of probation not less than three months prior to the termination of the probation period. The secretary of corrections will promulgate rules and regulations for the conduct of the person during the term of probation. For defendants found guilty in district court, like functions as the secretary performs in regard to probation may be performed by probation officers employed for that purpose by the county legislative authority of the county wherein the court is located.

6. The provisions of RCW 9.94A.501 and * 9.94A.5011 apply to sentences imposed under this section.

7. For purposes of this section, "domestic violence" means the same as in RCW 10.99.020.

## 9.95.270 - Compacts for out-of-state supervision of parolees or probationers—Uniform act.
The governor of this state is hereby authorized to execute a compact on behalf of the state of Washington with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

A compact entered into by and among the contracting states, signatories hereto, with the consent of the congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled "An Act granting the consent of congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes."

The contracting states solemnly agree:

1. That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state, party to this compact, (herein called "sending state"), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact, (herein called "receiving state"), while on probation or parole, if

   a. Such person is in fact a resident of or has his or her family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;

   b. Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his or her family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.

Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.

A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his or her coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he or she has been convicted.

2. That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.

3. That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him or her within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he or she should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he or she shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.

4. That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.

5. That the governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.

6. That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.

7. That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six months' notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states, party hereto.

The board may request the prosecuting attorney to assist in contacting the crime victim or surviving family member. If requested in writing by the sentencing court, the prosecuting attorney, or the crime victim or surviving family member, the indeterminate sentence review board must also provide any assessment, psychological evaluation, institutional behavior record, or other examination of the offender. Notice of the early release hearing date or parole eligibility date, and any evaluations or information relevant to the release decision, must be provided at least ninety days before the early release hearing or parole eligibility review hearing. The records described in this section, and other records reviewed by the board in response to the petition or parole eligibility review[,] must be disclosed in full and without redaction. Copies of records to be provided to the sentencing court and prosecuting attorney under this section must be provided as required without regard to whether the board has received a request for copies.

2. For the purpose of review by the board of a petition for early release or parole eligibility, it is presumed that none of the records reviewed are exempt from disclosure to the sentencing court, prosecuting attorney, and crime victim or surviving family member, in whole or in part. The board may not claim any exemption from disclosure for the records reviewed for an early release petition or parole eligibility review hearing.

3. The board and its subcommittees must provide comprehensive minutes of all related meetings and hearings on a petition for early release or parole eligibility review hearing. The comprehensive minutes should include, but not be limited to, the board members present, the name of the petitioner seeking review, the purpose and date of the meeting or hearing, a listing of documents reviewed, the names of members of the public who testify, a summary of discussion, the motions or other actions taken, and the votes of board members by name.

2. Following the hearing specified in subsection (3) of this section, the board may impose sanctions such as work release, home detention with electronic monitoring, work crew, community restitution, inpatient treatment, daily reporting, curfew, educational or counseling sessions, supervision enhanced through electronic monitoring, or any other sanctions available in the community, or may suspend the release and sanction up to sixty days' confinement in a local correctional facility for each violation, or revoke the release to community custody whenever an offender released by the board under RCW 9.95.420, 10.95.030(3), or 9.94A.730 violates any condition or requirement of community custody.

3. If an offender released by the board under RCW 9.95.420, 10.95.030(3), or 9.94A.730 is accused of violating any condition or requirement of community custody, he or she is entitled to a hearing before the board or a designee of the board prior to the imposition of sanctions. The hearing shall be considered as offender disciplinary proceedings and shall not be subject to chapter 34.05 RCW. The board shall develop hearing procedures and a structure of graduated sanctions consistent with the hearing procedures and graduated sanctions developed pursuant to RCW 9.94A.737. The board may suspend the offender's release to community custody and confine the offender in a correctional institution owned, operated by, or operated under contract with the state prior to the hearing unless the offender has been arrested and confined for a new criminal offense.

4. The hearing procedures required under subsection (3) of this section shall be developed by rule and include the following:

   a. Hearings shall be conducted by members or designees of the board unless the board enters into an agreement with the department to use the hearing officers established under RCW 9.94A.737;

   b. The board shall provide the offender with findings and conclusions which include the evidence relied upon, and the reasons the particular sanction was imposed. The board shall notify the offender of the right to appeal the sanction and the right to file a personal restraint petition under court rules after the final decision of the board;

   c. The hearing shall be held unless waived by the offender, and shall be electronically recorded. For offenders not in total confinement, the hearing shall be held within thirty days of service of notice of the violation, but not less than twenty-four hours after notice of the violation. For offenders in total confinement, the hearing shall be held within thirty days of service of notice of the violation, but not less than twenty-four hours after notice of the violation. The board or its designee shall make a determination whether probable cause exists to believe the violation or violations occurred. The determination shall be made within forty-eight hours of receipt of the allegation;

   d. The offender shall have the right to: (i) Be present at the hearing; (ii) have the assistance of a person qualified to assist the offender in the hearing, appointed by the presiding hearing officer if the offender has a language or communications barrier; (iii) testify or remain silent; (iv) call witnesses and present documentary evidence; (v) question witnesses who appear and testify; and (vi) be represented by counsel if revocation of the release to community custody upon a finding of violation is a probable sanction for the violation. The board may not revoke the release to community custody of any offender who was not represented by counsel at the hearing, unless the offender has waived the right to counsel; and

   e. The sanction shall take effect if affirmed by the presiding hearing officer.

5. Within seven days after the presiding hearing officer's decision, the offender may appeal the decision to the full board or to a panel of three reviewing examiners designated by the chair of the board or by the chair's designee. The sanction shall be reversed or modified if a majority of the panel finds that the sanction was not reasonably related to any of the following: (a) The crime of conviction; (b) the violation committed; (c) the offender's risk of reoffending; or (d) the safety of the community.

6. For purposes of this section, no finding of a violation of conditions may be based on unconfirmed or unconfirmable allegations.
