## 28A.340.080 - Innovation academy cooperatives—Formation—Student enrollment.

However, a high school student residing in a school district that is not a participating member of the cooperative may not enroll exclusively in alternative learning experience courses or programs as defined by *RCW 28A.150.325. Nothing in this section is intended to affect or otherwise modify the superintendent of public instruction's duty to approve and monitor online providers pursuant to RCW 28A.250.020.
