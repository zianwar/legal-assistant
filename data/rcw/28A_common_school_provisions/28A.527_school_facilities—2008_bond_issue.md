## 28A.527.005 - Findings—Intent—2008 c 179.
The legislature finds that the state's public schools and skill centers are a vital component of the future economic prosperity of our state and provide students with access to high quality academic and technical skills instruction. Skill centers challenge, motivate, and provide opportunities for students to achieve in basic skills, critical thinking, leadership, and work skills through hands-on education, applied academics, and technology training using a cost-effective delivery model. The legislature further finds that barriers to access exist for students in rural and high-density areas, but the development of satellite and branch campus programs will provide the needed access. The legislature further finds that existing and proposed new skill centers will require facilities and equipment that simulate business and industry. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide a new source of funding for the critical capital needs of the state's skill centers to enhance access to career and technical education opportunities and to improve the condition of existing facilities. Enhanced capital funding will provide skill centers the ability to fulfill their critical role in maintaining and stimulating the state's economy and expanding quality academic and career and technical education opportunities to more students, especially students who lack access to these programs to date.

In the interest of funding equity and ensuring a commitment to the new development, major renovation, or expansion of skill centers, all school district partners must contribute to the acquisition or major capital costs of skill center projects supported by this act to the greatest extent feasible.

## 28A.527.010 - School construction assistance grants—Capital improvements—Bond issue.
For the purpose of providing school construction assistance grants and needed capital improvements consisting of the predesign, design, acquisition, construction, modification, renovation, expansion, equipping, and other improvements of skill centers facilities, including capital improvements to support satellite or branch campus programs for underserved rural areas or high-density areas, the state finance committee is authorized to issue general obligation bonds of the state of Washington in the sum of one hundred million dollars, or as much thereof as may be required, to finance all or a part of these projects and all costs incidental thereto. Bonds authorized in this section may be sold at such price as the state finance committee shall determine. No bonds authorized in this section may be offered for sale without prior legislative appropriation of the net proceeds of the sale of the bonds. If the state finance committee deems it necessary to issue taxable bonds in order to comply with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds, the proceeds of such taxable bonds shall be transferred to the state taxable building construction account in lieu of any deposits otherwise provided by this section. The state treasurer shall submit written notice to the director of financial management if it is determined that any such transfer to the state taxable building construction account is necessary.
