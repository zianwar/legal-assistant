2. It is the state's policy that decisions on proposed changes in school district organization should be made, whenever possible, by negotiated agreement between the affected school districts. If the districts cannot agree, the decision shall be made by the regional committees on school district organization, based on the committees' best judgment, taking into consideration the following factors and factors under RCW 28A.315.205:

   a. A balance of local petition requests and the needs of the statewide community at large in a manner that advances the best interest of public education in the affected school districts and communities, the educational service district, and the state;

   b. Responsibly serving all of the affected citizens and students by contributing to logical service boundaries and recognizing a changing economic pattern within the educational service districts of the state;

   c. Enhancing the educational opportunities of pupils in the territory by reducing existing disparities among the affected school districts' ability to provide operating and capital funds through an equitable adjustment of the assets and liabilities of the affected districts;

   d. Promoting a wiser use of public funds through improvement in the school district system of the educational service districts and the state; and

   e. Other criteria or considerations as may be established in rule by the superintendent of public instruction.

1. As of the effective date of dissolution of a financially insolvent district, all existing employment contracts and collective bargaining agreements of the financially insolvent district shall be extinguished.

2. School districts that annex or receive territory from a financially insolvent district have full authority to constitute their workforces, and have no duty to bargain with, or observe the former wages and working conditions of, any former employees of a financially insolvent district who may be hired; rather, any employees hired from a financially insolvent district become part of the appropriate bargaining units, if any, of the annexing or receiving district, and their wages and working conditions are defined by the terms of the annexing or receiving district's bargaining agreements or other policies or conditions of employment.

3. Certificated employees of a district that is dissolved due to financial insolvency have no continuing contract or appeal rights under RCW 28A.405.210 through 28A.405.380 or other law, nor do certificated or classified employees of a district dissolved due to financial insolvency have any resort to grievance or arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement, and any inconsistent provision of any individual contract or collective bargaining agreement is null and void. Sufficient cause for nonrenewal or discharge of such certificated and classified personnel is deemed to exist by sole virtue of the employer district's dissolution for financial insolvency. Notice of nonrenewal or discharge under such circumstances may be given by the educational service district superintendent without regard to date. Any appeal must be addressed to the educational service district board on an expedited basis according to rules established by the superintendent of public instruction, and must be confined to the issue of whether the employer district is dissolved for reasons of financial insolvency. There is no judicial review for the educational service district board's decisions in these matters.

## 28A.315.235 - Consolidation—Petition.
1. A proposed change in school district organization by consolidation of territory from two or more school districts to form a new school district may be initiated by:

   a. A written petition presented to the educational service district superintendent signed by ten or more registered voters residing:

      i. In each whole district and in each part of a district proposed to be included in any single new district; or

      ii. In the territory of a proposed new district that comprises a part of only one or more districts and approved by the boards of directors of the affected school districts;

   b. A written petition presented to the educational service district superintendent signed by ten percent or more of the registered voters residing in such affected areas or area without the approval of the boards of directors of the affected school districts.

2. The petition shall state the name and number of each district involved in or affected by the proposal to form the new district and shall describe the boundaries of the proposed new district. No more than one petition for consolidation of the same two school districts or parts thereof shall be considered during a school fiscal year.

3. The educational service district superintendent may not complete any consolidation of territory under this section unless he or she has first called and held a special election of the voters of the affected districts to afford those voters an opportunity to approve or reject the proposed consolidation. A simple majority shall determine approval or rejection.

4. If a proposed change in school district organization by consolidation of territory has been approved under this section, the educational service district superintendent shall make an order establishing all approved changes involving the alteration of the boundaries of the affected districts. The order shall also establish all approved terms of the equitable adjustment of assets and liabilities involving the affected districts. The superintendent shall certify his or her action to each county auditor, each county treasurer, each county assessor, and the superintendents of all school districts affected by the action.

## 28A.315.245 - Adjustment of assets and liabilities.
In determining an equitable adjustment of assets and liabilities, the negotiating school districts and the regional committee shall consider the following factors:

1. The number of school-age children residing in each school district and in each part of a district involved or affected by the proposed change in school district organization;

2. The assessed valuation of the property located in each school district and in each part of a district involved or affected by the proposed change in school district organization;

3. The purpose for which the bonded indebtedness of any school district involved or affected by the proposed change in school district organization was incurred;

4. The history and relationship of the property affected to the students and communities affected by the proposed change in school district organization;

5. Additional burdens to the districts affected by the proposed change in school district organization as a result of the proposed organization;

6. The value, location, and disposition of all improvements located in the school districts involved or affected by the proposed change in school district organization;

## 28A.315.255 - Adjustment of indebtedness.
1. The fact of the issuance of bonds by a school district, heretofore or hereafter, does not prevent changes in the organization and extent of school districts, regardless of whether or not such bonds or any part thereof are outstanding at the time of change.

2. In case of any change:

   a. The bonded indebtedness outstanding against any school district involved in or affected by such change shall be adjusted equitably among the old school districts and the new district or districts, if any, involved or affected; and

   b. The property and other assets and the liabilities other than bonded indebtedness of any school district involved in or affected by any such change shall also be adjusted in the manner and to the effect provided for in this section, except if all the territory of an old school district is included in a single new district or is annexed to a single existing district, in which event the title to the property and other assets and the liabilities other than bonded indebtedness of the old district vests in and becomes the assets and liabilities of the new district or of the existing district, as applicable.

## 28A.315.265 - Adjustment of bonded indebtedness—Order—Special elections.
If adjustments of bonded indebtedness are made between or among school districts in connection with the alteration of the boundaries of the school districts under this chapter, the order of the educational service district superintendent establishing the terms of adjustment of bonded indebtedness shall provide and specify:

1. In every case where bonded indebtedness is transferred from one school district to another school district:

   a. That such bonded indebtedness is assumed by the school district to which it is transferred;

   b. That thereafter such bonded indebtedness shall be the obligation of the school district to which it is transferred;

   c. That, if the terms of adjustment so provide, any bonded indebtedness thereafter incurred by such transferee school district through the sale of bonds authorized before the date its boundaries were altered shall be the obligation of such school district including the territory added thereto; and

   d. That taxes shall be levied thereafter against the taxable property located within such school district as it is constituted after its boundaries were altered, the taxes to be levied at the times and in the amounts required to pay the principal of and the interest on the bonded indebtedness assumed or incurred, as the same become due and payable.

2. In computing the debt limitation of any school district from which or to which bonded indebtedness has been transferred, the amount of transferred bonded indebtedness at any time outstanding:

   a. Shall be an offset against and deducted from the total bonded indebtedness, if any, of the school district from which the bonded indebtedness was transferred; and

   b. Shall be deemed to be bonded indebtedness solely of the transferee school district that assumed the indebtedness.

3. In every case where adjustments of bonded indebtedness do not provide for transfer of bonded indebtedness from one school district to another school district:

   a. That the existing bonded indebtedness of each school district, the boundaries of which are altered and any bonded indebtedness incurred by each such school district through the sale of bonds authorized before the date its boundaries were altered is the obligation of the school district in its reduced or enlarged form, as the case may be; and

   b. That taxes shall be levied thereafter against the taxable property located within each such school district in its reduced or enlarged form, as the case may be, at the times and in the amounts required to pay the principal of and interest on such bonded indebtedness as the same become due and payable.

4. If a change in school district organization approved by the regional committee concerns a proposal to form a new school district or if a change in school district organization includes a proposal for adjustment of voted general obligation bonded indebtedness, a special election of the voters residing within the territory of the proposed new district, or of the school district involved in a proposal for adjustment of bonded indebtedness as the case may be, shall be held for the purpose of affording those voters an opportunity to approve or reject such proposals as concern or affect them.

5. In a case involving both the question of the formation of a new school district and the question of adjustment of bonded indebtedness, the questions may be submitted to the voters either in the form of a single proposition or as separate propositions, whichever seems expedient to the educational service district superintendent. When the regional committee has passed appropriate resolutions for the questions to be submitted and the educational service district superintendent has given notice thereof to the county auditor, the special election shall be called and conducted, and the returns canvassed as in regular school district elections.

If a special election is held to vote on a proposal or alternate proposals to form a new school district, the votes cast by the registered voters in each component district shall be tabulated separately. Any such proposition shall be considered approved only if it receives a majority of the votes cast in each separate district voting thereon.

2. If a special election is held to vote on a proposal for adjustment of bonded indebtedness, the entire vote cast by the registered voters of the proposed new district or of the established district as the case may be shall be tabulated.

This section may not be construed to prevent, after the effective date of the change, such adjustments of bonded indebtedness as are provided for in this chapter.

2. The county legislative authority shall provide, by appropriate levies on the taxable property of each school district, for the payment of the bonded indebtedness outstanding against it after any of the changes or adjustments under this chapter have been effected.

   c. For outstanding voted bonded indebtedness of the financially insolvent school district, the board of directors of the receiving or annexing school district may determine that all or any portion of the voted bonded indebtedness be refunded pursuant to chapter 39.53 RCW, in which case the board of directors of the annexing or receiving district shall act as the governing body of the financially insolvent school district and is expressly empowered to take all action it deems necessary to accomplish such refunding; and

   d. Any balance in the debt service fund of the financially insolvent school district remaining after all such voted bonded indebtedness is paid must be transferred to the general fund of the receiving or annexing school district.
