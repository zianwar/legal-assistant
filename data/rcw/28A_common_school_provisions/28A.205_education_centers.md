   b. The cost-effectiveness of the proposal; and

In the event that an additional center or centers become certified and apply to the superintendent for funds to be allocated from a legislative appropriation which does not increase from the immediately preceding biennium, or does not increase sufficiently to allow such additional center or centers to operate at minimally acceptable levels of service without reducing the funds available to previously funded centers, the superintendent shall not provide funding for such additional center or centers from such appropriation.
