## 28A.235.140 - School breakfast programs.
1. For the purposes of this section:

   a. "Free or reduced-price lunches" means lunches served by a school district that qualify for federal reimbursement as free or reduced-price lunches under the national school lunch program.

   b. "School breakfast program" means a program meeting federal requirements defined in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1773.

   c. "Severe-need school" means a school that qualifies for a severe-need school reimbursement rate from federal funds for school breakfasts served to children from low-income families.

2. School districts shall be required to develop and implement plans for a school breakfast program in severe-need schools, pursuant to the schedule in this section. For the second year prior to the implementation of the district's school breakfast program, and for each subsequent school year, each school district shall submit data enabling the superintendent of public instruction to determine which schools within the district will qualify as severe-need schools. In developing its plan, each school district shall consult with an advisory committee including school staff and community members appointed by the board of directors of the district.

3. Using district-wide data on school lunch participation during the 1988-89 school year, the superintendent of public instruction shall adopt a schedule for implementation of school breakfast programs in severe-need schools as follows:

   a. School districts where at least forty percent of lunches served to students are free or reduced-price lunches shall submit a plan for implementation of a school breakfast program in severe-need schools to the superintendent of public instruction no later than July 1, 1990. Each such district shall implement a school breakfast program in all severe-need schools no later than the second day of school in the 1990-91 school year and in each school year thereafter.

   b. School districts where at least twenty-five but less than forty percent of lunches served to students are free or reduced-price lunches shall submit a plan for implementation of a school breakfast program in severe-need schools to the superintendent of public instruction no later than July 1, 1991. Each such district shall implement a school breakfast program in all severe-need schools no later than the second day of school in the 1991-92 school year and in each school year thereafter.

   c. School districts where less than twenty-five percent of lunches served to students are free or reduced-price lunches shall submit a plan for implementation of a school breakfast program in severe-need schools to the superintendent of public instruction no later than July 1, 1992. Each such district shall implement a school breakfast program in all severe-need schools no later than the second day of school in the 1992-93 school year and in each school year thereafter.

   d. School districts that did not offer a school lunch program in the 1988-89 school year are encouraged to implement such a program and to provide a school breakfast program in all severe-need schools when eligible.

4. The requirements in this section shall lapse if the federal reimbursement rate for breakfasts served in severe-need schools is eliminated.

5. Students who do not meet family-income criteria for free breakfasts shall be eligible to participate in the school breakfast programs established under this section, and school districts may charge for the breakfasts served to these students. Requirements that school districts have school breakfast programs under this section shall not create or imply any state funding obligation for these costs. The legislature does not intend to include these programs within the state's obligation for basic education funding under Article IX of the Constitution.

   a. Applications to determine free or reduced-price lunch eligibility shall be distributed and collected for all households of children in schools containing any of the grades kindergarten through four and in which there are no United States department of agriculture child nutrition programs. The applications that are collected must be reviewed to determine eligibility for free or reduced-price lunches. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require completion or submission of the application by a parent or guardian.

   b.

      i. Schools not offering a school lunch program and in which twenty-five percent or more of the enrolled students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch shall implement a school lunch program not later than the second day of school in the 2005-06 school year and in each school year thereafter.

      ii. The superintendent shall establish minimum standards defining the lunch meals to be served, and such standards must be sufficient to qualify the meals for any available federal reimbursement.

3. To the extent funds are appropriated for this purpose, each school district shall implement a school breakfast program in each school where more than forty percent of students eligible to participate in the school lunch program qualify for free or reduced-price meal reimbursement by the school year 2005-06.

4. Each school district shall implement a summer food service program in each public school in the district in which a summer program of academic, enrichment, or remedial services is provided and in which 50 percent or more of the children enrolled in the school qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.

6. Requirements that school districts have a school lunch, breakfast, or summer nutrition program under this section shall not create or imply any state funding obligation for these costs. The legislature does not intend to include these programs within the state's obligation for basic education funding under Article IX of the state Constitution.

7. Beginning in the 2021-22 school year, school districts with school lunch programs must eliminate lunch copays for students in prekindergarten through 12th grade who qualify for reduced-price lunches, and the superintendent of public instruction must allocate funding for this purpose.

8. The requirements in this section shall lapse if the federal reimbursement for any school breakfasts, lunches, or summer food service programs is eliminated.

9. School districts may be exempted from the requirements of this section by showing good cause why they cannot comply with the office of the superintendent of public instruction to the extent that such exemption is not in conflict with federal or state law. The process and criteria by which school districts are exempted shall be developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with representatives of school directors, school food service, community-based organizations and the Washington state PTA.
