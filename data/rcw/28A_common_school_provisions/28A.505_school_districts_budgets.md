Revenue for accrual basis expenditure funds is limited to amounts received in cash or noncash donations plus or minus adjustments for revenue accruals.

2. "Accrual basis expenditures" mean expenditures incurred during a given fiscal period, whether paid or unpaid.

3. "Cash basis expenditures" mean actual disbursements during a given fiscal period except for debt service, regardless of when liabilities are incurred, or the period of incurrence of expenditures.

4. "Cash basis revenue" means actual receipt of revenue not adjusted for revenue accruals.

5. "Revenue accruals" means those revenues anticipated to be received in cash after the close of the fiscal period that represent reimbursement for expenditures incurred by the end of the fiscal period.

6. "Appropriation" means the maximum authorization during a given fiscal period to incur expenditures.

7. "Disbursements" mean payments in cash, including but not limited to issuance of warrants.

## 28A.505.180 - Second-class school districts—Additional appropriation resolutions—Procedure.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a second-class school district needs to increase the amount of the appropriation from any fund for any reason, the school district board of directors, before incurring expenditures in excess of appropriation, shall adopt a resolution stating the facts and estimating the amount of additional appropriation needed.

Such resolution shall be voted on at a public meeting, notice to be given in the manner provided by RCW 28A.505.050. Its introduction and passage shall require the vote of a majority of all members of the school district board of directors.

Any person may appear at the meeting at which the appropriation resolution is to be voted on and be heard for or against the adoption thereof.

Upon passage of the appropriation resolution the school district shall petition the superintendent of public instruction for approval to increase the amount of its appropriations in the manner prescribed in rules and regulations for such approval by the superintendent.

Copies of all appropriation resolutions approved by the superintendent of public instruction shall be filed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction with the educational service district.

## 28A.505.200 - Repayment of federal moneys—Federal disallowance determination.
Each school district that receives federal moneys from or through the superintendent of public instruction shall comply with applicable federal requirements and shall repay expenditures subsequently disallowed by the federal government together with such interest as may be assessed by the federal government. Once a federal disallowance determination, decision, or order becomes final respecting federal moneys expended by a school district, the superintendent of public instruction may withhold all or a portion of the annual basic education allocation amounts otherwise due and apportionable to the school district as necessary to facilitate payment of the principal and interest to the federal government. The superintendent of public instruction may pay withheld basic education allocation moneys:

1. To the school district before the close of the biennium and following the school district's repayment of moneys due the federal government, or the school district's commitment to an acceptable repayment plan, or both; or

2. To the federal government, subject to the reappropriation of the withheld basic education allocation, moneys for the purpose of payment to the federal government.

No withholding of basic education allocation moneys may occur under this subsection until the superintendent of public instruction has first determined that the withholding should not substantially impair the school district's financial ability to provide the basic education program offerings required by statute.

## 28A.505.230 - Condensed compliance reports—Second-class districts.
Any compliance reporting requirements as a result of laws in this chapter that apply to second-class districts may be submitted in accordance with RCW 28A.330.250.

## 28A.505.240 - Enrichment levy spending plans—Preballot approval—Revised spending plan for voter-approved levies.
1. As required by RCW 84.52.053(4), before a school district may submit an enrichment levy under RCW 84.52.053 to the voters, it must have received approval from the office of the superintendent of public instruction of an expenditure plan for the district's enrichment levy and other local revenues as defined in RCW 28A.150.276. Within thirty days after receiving the plan the office of the superintendent of public instruction must notify the school district whether the spending plan is approved. If the office of the superintendent of public instruction rejects a district's proposed spending plan, then the district may submit a revised spending plan, and the superintendent must approve or reject the revised submission within thirty days. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may approve a spending plan only if it determines that the enrichment levy and other local revenues as defined in RCW 28A.150.276(1) will be used solely for permitted enrichment activities as provided in RCW 28A.150.276(2).

2. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, after a school district has received voter approval for a levy for an enrichment levy under RCW 84.52.053, a school district may change its spending plan for the voter-approved levy by submitting a revised spending plan to the office of the superintendent of public instruction for review and approval. To revise a previously approved spending plan, the district must provide notice and an opportunity for review and comment at an open meeting of the school board, and the board must adopt the revised spending plan by resolution. The board must then submit the plan to the office of the superintendent of public instruction. Within thirty days after receiving the revised spending plan the office must notify the school district whether the revised spending plan is approved. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may approve a revised spending plan only if it determines that the enrichment levy and other local revenues as defined in RCW 28A.150.276(1) will be used solely for permitted enrichment activities as provided in RCW 28A.150.276(2).

   b. If the superintendent has approved expenditures for specific purposes under (a) of this subsection, a district may change the relative amounts to be spent for those respective purposes for the same levy in subsequent years without having to first receive approval for the change from the office of the superintendent of public instruction if the district adopts the change as part of its annual budget proposal after a public hearing under RCW 28A.505.060.

3. This section applies to taxes levied for collection beginning in calendar year 2020 and thereafter.
