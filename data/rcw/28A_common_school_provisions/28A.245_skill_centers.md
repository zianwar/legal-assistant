## 28A.245.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that student access to programs offered at skill centers can help prepare them for careers, apprenticeships, and postsecondary education. The legislature further finds that current limits on how school districts and skill centers report full-time equivalent students and the time students are served provide a disincentive for school districts to send their students to skill centers. The legislature further finds that there are barriers to providing access to students in rural and remote areas but that there are opportunities to do so with satellite and branch campus programs, distance and online learning programs, and collaboration with higher education, business, and labor. The legislature further finds that skill centers provide opportunities for dropout prevention and retrieval programs by offering programs that accommodate students' work schedules and provide credit retrieval opportunities. The legislature further finds that implementing the recommendations from the study by the workforce training and education coordinating board will enhance skill center programs and student access to those programs.

## 28A.245.010 - Skill centers—Purpose—Operation.
A skill center is a regional career and technical education partnership established to provide access to comprehensive industry-defined career and technical programs of study that prepare students for careers, employment, apprenticeships, and postsecondary education. A skill center is operated by a host school district and governed by an administrative council in accordance with a cooperative agreement.

## 28A.245.030 - Revised guidelines for skill centers—Satellite and branch campus programs—Capital plan—Studies—Master plan—Rules.
1. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall review and revise the guidelines for skill centers to encourage skill center programs. The superintendent, in cooperation with the workforce training and education coordinating board, skill center directors, and the Washington association for career and technical education, shall review and revise the existing skill centers' policy guidelines and create and adopt rules governing skill centers as follows:

   a. The threshold enrollment at a skill center shall be revised so that a skill center program need not have a minimum of seventy percent of its students enrolled on the skill center core campus in order to facilitate serving rural students through expansion of skill center programs by means of satellite programs or branch campuses;

   b. The developmental planning for branch campuses shall be encouraged. Underserved rural areas or high-density areas may partner with an existing skill center to create satellite programs or a branch campus. Once a branch campus reaches sufficient enrollment to become self-sustaining, it may become a separate skill center or remain an extension of the founding skill center; and

   c. Satellite and branch campus programs shall be encouraged to address high-demand fields.

2. Rules adopted under this section shall allow for innovative models of satellite and branch campus programs, and such programs shall not be limited to those housed in physical buildings.

3. The superintendent of public instruction shall develop and deliver a ten-year capital plan for legislative review before implementation. The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt rules that set as a goal a ten percent minimum local project contribution threshold for major skill center projects, unless there is a compelling rationale not to do so, including but not limited to local economic conditions, as determined by the superintendent of public instruction. This applies to the acquisition or major capital costs of skill center projects as outlined in the ten-year capital plan.

4. Subject to available funding, the superintendent shall:

   a. Conduct approved feasibility studies for serving noncooperative rural and high-density area students in their geographic areas; and

   b. Develop a statewide master plan that identifies standards and resources needed to create a technology infrastructure for connecting all skill centers to the K-20 network.

## 28A.245.040 - Expanded access—Targeted populations—Evaluation.
Subject to available funding, skill centers shall provide access to late afternoon and evening sessions and summer school programs, to rural and high-density area students aligned with regionally identified high-demand occupations. When possible, the programs shall be specifically targeted for credit retrieval, dropout prevention and intervention for at-risk students, and retrieval of dropouts. Skill centers that receive funding for these activities must participate in an evaluation that is designed to quantify results and identify best practices, collaborate with local community partners in providing a comprehensive program, and provide matching funds.

\[ [2007 c 463 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5790-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2007%20c%20463%20§%205); \]

## 28A.245.050 - Skill centers of excellence—Running start for career and technical education grant program—Career and technical programs of study.
