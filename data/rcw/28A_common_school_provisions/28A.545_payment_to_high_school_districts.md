The purposes of RCW 28A.545.030 through 28A.545.110 and 84.52.0531 are to:

1. Simplify the annual process of determining and paying the amounts due by nonhigh school districts to high school districts for educating students residing in a nonhigh school district;

2. Provide for a payment schedule that coincides to the extent practicable with the ability of nonhigh school districts to pay and the need of high school districts for payment;

3. Establish that the maximum amount due per annual average full-time equivalent student by a nonhigh school district for each school year is the lesser of:

   a. The enrichment levy rate per annual average full-time equivalent student levied upon the taxpayers of the high school district; or

   b. The enrichment levy rate per annual average full-time equivalent student levied upon the taxpayers of the nonhigh school district;

4. If the nonhigh school district has not levied an enrichment levy during the current school year, then the amount due per annual average full-time equivalent student by the nonhigh school district is the enrichment levy rate per annual average full-time equivalent student levied upon the taxpayers of the high school district; and

5. Designate the revenue provided to secondary school buildings to ensure dollars are being spent to support secondary school students.

The result of the calculation provided for in subsection (1)(b) of this section [(b) of this subsection] shall be adjusted upward to the extent the estimated amount due by a nonhigh school district for the prior school year was less than the actual amount due based upon actual annual average full-time equivalent student enrollments during the previous school year and the actual per annual average full-time equivalent student enrichment levy rate for the current tax collection year, or adjusted downward to the extent the estimated amount due was greater than such actual amount due or greater than such lesser amount as a high school district may have elected to assess pursuant to RCW 28A.545.090.
