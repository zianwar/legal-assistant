## 67.38.010 - Purpose.
The legislature finds that expansion of a cultural tourism would attract new visitors to our state and aid the development of a nonpolluting industry. The creation or renovation, and operation of cultural arts, stadium and convention facilities benefiting all the citizens of this state would enhance the recreational industry's ability to attract such new visitors. The additional income and employment resulting therefrom would strengthen the economic base of the state.

It is declared that the construction, modification, renovation, and operation of facilities for cultural arts, stadium and convention uses will enhance the progress and economic growth of this state. The continued growth and development of this recreational industry provides for the general welfare and is an appropriate matter of concern to the people of the state of Washington.

2. Within sixty days of the adoption of such resolutions, or presentation of such a petition, the county legislative authority shall hold a public hearing on the proposed creation of such a district.

4. The proposition to create a cultural arts, stadium and convention district shall be submitted to the voters of the proposed district at the next general election held sixty or more days after the adoption of the resolution.
