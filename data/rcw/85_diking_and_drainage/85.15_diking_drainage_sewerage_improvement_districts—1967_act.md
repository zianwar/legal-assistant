## 85.15.010 - Declaration of purpose.
The maintenance, enlargement and extension of diking, drainage and sewerage improvement districts formed under chapter 85.08 RCW is essential to the public welfare and economy of the state. The influx of population and changes in land use since many such districts were formed, has made obsolete, expensive and unjust the method used under existing law to provide funds for the operation of such districts and for the maintenance and expansion of their systems of improvement.

\[ [1967 c 184 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%202); \]

## 85.15.020 - Definitions.
As used in this chapter:

"District" means a diking, drainage or sewerage improvement district organized under chapter 85.08 RCW.

"Maintenance" means and includes not merely operating expenses and such upkeep and other work commonly classed as maintenance as shall be necessary to restore and preserve the district's systems of improvement and the machinery and equipment operated in connection therewith in the same or as good condition as when originally constructed and installed, but also the making of such changes in and betterments to the original works, improvements and installations as shall, subject to approval of the board of county commissioners, be by the board deemed necessary to put the systems of improvements into such condition as will provide protection and services as contemplated and intended by the original construction and any enlargement and extensions thereof thereafter made.

\[ [1967 c 184 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%203); \]

## 85.15.030 - Property roll—Basis and requisites—Separate levies for prior indebtedness.
To operate under this chapter, the board of commissioners of the improvement district shall cause to be prepared and filed with the board of county commissioners a property roll. The roll shall contain: (1) A description of all properties benefited and improvements thereon which receive protection and service from the systems of the district with the name of the owner or the reputed owner thereof and his or her address as shown on the tax rolls of the assessor or treasurer of the county wherein the property is located and (2) the determined value of such land and improvements thereon as last assessed and equalized by the assessor of such county or counties. Such assessed and equalized values shall be deemed prima facie to be just, fair, and correct valuations against which annual taxes shall be levied for the operation of the district and the maintenance and expansion of its facilities.

If property outside of the limits of the original district are upon the roll as adopted ultimately, and the original district has outstanding bonds or long-term warrants, the board of county commissioners shall set up separate dollar rate levies for the full retirement thereof.

\[ [2013 c 23 § 419](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5077-S.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%2023%20§%20419); [1973 1st ex.s. c 195 § 111](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c195.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20195%20§%20111); [1967 c 184 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%204); \]

## 85.15.040 - Public hearing—Notice, publication.
When a property roll is filed with the county legislative authority, the county legislative authority shall hold a public hearing to determine whether the facts and conditions heretofore recited in this chapter as a prerequisite to its application do or do not exist, and shall give notice of hearing as follows:

The notice shall be published at least once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the area involved. The last publication shall be more than fifteen days prior to date of hearing.

\[ [1985 c 469 § 75](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c469.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20469%20§%2075); [1967 c 184 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%205); \]

## 85.15.050 - Written objections—Filing—Grounds—Waiver.
Any person, owner or reputed owner having any interest in any property against which the board of county commissioners seeks to make a protection and service charge under this chapter, may object thereto. All such objections must be in writing and filed with the board of county commissioners before the hearing is commenced upon the roll containing such properties and must state clearly the grounds of such objection. Objections not made within this time and in this manner shall be deemed conclusively to have been waived.

\[ [1967 c 184 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%206); \]

## 85.15.060 - Reexamination of properties on roll—Adjustment, periodic revision, of valuations.
The board of county commissioners may at any time reexamine the properties on any roll, and upon receipt of a petition from the board of supervisors of the district or the written request of a property owner shall do so. If it is found that the condition of such property or properties has changed so that such property should be eliminated from any rolls on file, or the valuation against which dollar rate is levied should be lowered, it shall so determine and enter an order adjusting the valuation as to such properties and shall certify and file a copy thereof with the treasurer of the county wherein the property is situated, and the treasurer shall alter and change the existing rolls accordingly. Valuations may be revised periodically to reflect changes in real property valuations by the county assessor.

\[ [1973 1st ex.s. c 195 § 112](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c195.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20195%20§%20112); [1967 c 184 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%207); \]

## 85.15.070 - Roll constitutes valuations against which levy made and collected—Hearing on adjustments.
The roll approved and certified to the county officers by the board of county commissioners as in this chapter provided shall constitute the valuations of land, buildings and improvements furnished protection and services by the systems of the district against which valuation taxes shall be levied and collected annually in the same manner as general taxes for the continuing operations of the district and its systems. The valuations on said roll shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in the manner provided in RCW 85.15.060.

The board of county commissioners shall hold a hearing on such adjustments at the county seat at the time of equalization of real property assessments for the purpose of considering written objections to any revision of valuations filed at least ten days prior to the hearing and shall give published notice only of such hearing as provided in RCW 85.15.040.

\[ [1973 1st ex.s. c 195 § 113](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c195.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20195%20§%20113); [1967 c 184 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%208); \]

## 85.15.080 - Roll and proceedings conclusive—Remedies.
Wherever any roll shall have been adopted by the board of county commissioners, the regularity, validity and correctness of the proceedings relating thereto shall be conclusive upon all parties, and it cannot in any manner be contested or questioned in any proceeding whatsoever by any person not filing written objections to the roll as provided in RCW 85.15.050 and appealing from the action of said board in confirming the roll in the manner and within the time in this chapter provided. No proceeding of any kind, except proceedings had throughout the process of appeal as in this chapter provided, shall be commenced or prosecuted or may be maintained, for the purpose of defeating or contesting any assessment or charge made through levies under this chapter, or the sale of any property to pay such charges: PROVIDED, That suit in injunction may be brought to prevent collection of charges of assessments or sale of property thereunder upon the following grounds and no other:

1. That the property charged or about to be sold does not appear upon the district roll, or

2. The charge has been paid.

\[ [1967 c 184 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c184.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20184%20§%209); \]

## 85.15.090 - Review by superior court—How taken.
The decision of the board of county commissioners upon any objection made within the time and in the manner prescribed may be reviewed by the superior court of the county wherein the property in question is located, upon appeal thereto taken in the following manner: Any person aggrieved must file his or her petition for writ of review with the clerk of the superior court wherein the property is located within ten days after the roll affecting such aggrieved party was adopted by resolution, and serve a copy thereof upon the county treasurer.
