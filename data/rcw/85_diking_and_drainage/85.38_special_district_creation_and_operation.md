## 85.38.020 - Establishment of special districts—Petition or resolution—Contents.
The establishment of a special district may be initiated by either petition of the owners of property located within the proposed special district, or by resolution of the county legislative authority or authorities within which the proposed special district is located.

A petition calling for the creation of a special district, which is signed by at least ten owners of land located within the proposed district, shall be filed with the county legislative authority within which a proposed special district, or the largest portion of a special district, is located. If the proposed special district is proposed to be located within more than one county, the county legislative authority receiving the petitions shall notify the other county legislative authorities of the proposal.

The engineer shall report to the county legislative authority within ninety days of such direction on the proposed boundaries of the special district within the county and feasibility of that portion of the proposed project. If the proposed special district is located in more than one county, the county legislative authority of each county shall direct its county engineer to investigate and report on the proposal within its boundaries.

\[ [1985 c 396 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c396.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20396%20§%204); \]

## 85.38.040 - Proposed special districts—Public hearing—Notice.
The county legislative authority shall schedule a public hearing on the proposed special district if the county engineer's report indicates that the proposed projects are feasible. If the engineers of each of the counties within which a proposed special district is located indicate that the proposed projects are feasible, the county legislative authorities shall schedule a joint public hearing on the proposed special district. The county legislative authority may, on its own initiative, schedule a public hearing on the proposed special district if the county engineer's report indicates that the proposed projects are not feasible. The county legislative authorities of counties within which a proposed special district is located may, on their own initiative, schedule a joint public hearing on the proposed special district if one or more of the county engineers' reports indicate that the proposed projects are not feasible.

Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the proposed special district, which notice shall be purchased in the manner of a general advertisement, not to be included with legal advertisements or with classified advertisements. This notice shall be published at least twice, not more than twenty nor less than three days before public hearing. Additional notice shall be made as required in RCW 79.44.040.

## 85.38.050 - Public hearing—Elections.
The county legislative authority or authorities shall conduct the public hearing at the date, time, and place indicated in the notice. Public hearings may be continued to other dates, times, and places specified by the county legislative authority or authorities before the adjournment of the public hearing.

After receiving the public testimony, the county legislative authority may cause an election to be held to authorize the creation of a special district if it finds:

1. That creation of the special district will be conducive to the public health, convenience and welfare;

2. That the creation of the special district will be of special benefit to a majority of the lands included within the special district; and

3. That the proposed improvements are feasible and economical, and that the benefits of these improvements exceed costs for the improvements.

If the proposed special district is located within two or more counties, the county legislative authorities may cause an election to be held to authorize the creation of the special district upon making the findings set forth in subsections (1) through (3) of this section.

The county legislative authority or authorities may also choose not to allow such an election to be held by either failing to act or finding that one or more of these factors are not met.

\[ [1991 c 349 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1194-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20349%20§%209); [1985 c 396 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c396.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20396%20§%206); \]

## 85.38.060 - Elections—Notice—Costs.
The county legislative authority or authorities shall cause an election on the question of creating the special district to be held if findings as provided in RCW 85.38.050 are made. The county legislative authority or authorities shall designate a time and date for such election, which shall be one of the special election dates provided for in RCW 29A.04.330, together with the site or sites at which votes may be cast.

The county auditor or auditors of the counties within which the proposed special district is located shall conduct the election and prepare a list of presumed eligible voters.

Notices for the election shall be published as provided in RCW 85.38.040. The special district shall be created if the proposition to create the special district is approved by a simple majority vote of the voters voting on the proposition and the special district may assume operations whenever the initial members of the governing body are appointed as provided in RCW 85.38.070.

Any special district created after July 28, 1985, may only have special assessments measured and imposed, and budgets adopted, as provided in RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170.

If the special district is created, the county or counties may charge the special district for the costs incurred by the county engineer or engineers pursuant to RCW 85.38.030 and the costs of the auditor or auditors related to the election to authorize the creation of the special district pursuant to this section. Such county actions shall be deemed to be special benefits of the property located within the special district that are paid through the imposition of special assessments.

One member of the governing body shall be elected at the time of special district general elections in each even-numbered year for a term of six years beginning as soon as the election returns have been certified for assumption of office by elected officials of cities.

2. The terms of office of members of the governing bodies of special districts, who are holding office on July 28, 1985, shall be altered to provide staggered six-year terms as provided in this subsection. The member who on July 28, 1985, has the longest term remaining shall have his or her term altered so that the position will be filled at the February 1992, special district general election; the member with the second longest term remaining shall have his or her term altered so that the position will be filled at the December, 1989, special district general election; and the member with the third longest term of office shall have his or her term altered so that the position will be filled at the December, 1987, special district general election.

3. The initial members of the governing body of a newly created special district shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the county within which the special district, or the largest portion of the special district, is located. These initial governing body members shall serve until their successors are elected and qualified at the next special district general election held at least ninety days after the special district is established. At that election the first elected members of the governing body shall be elected. No primary elections may be held. Any voter of a special district may become a candidate for such a position by filing written notice of this intention with the county auditor at least thirty, but not more than sixty, days before a special district general election. The county auditor in consultation with the special district shall establish the filing period. The names of all candidates for such positions shall be listed alphabetically. At this first election, the candidate receiving the greatest number of votes shall have a six-year term, the candidate receiving the second greatest number of votes shall have a four-year term, and the candidate receiving the third greatest number of votes shall have a two-year term of office. The initially elected members of a governing body shall take office immediately when qualified as defined in RCW 29A.04.133. Thereafter the candidate receiving the greatest number of votes shall be elected for a six-year term of office.

4. The requirements for the filing period and method for filing declarations of candidacy for the governing body of the district and the arrangement of candidate names on the ballot for all special district elections conducted after the initial election in the district shall be the same as the requirements for the initial election in the district. No primary elections may be held for the governing body of a special district.

5. Whenever a vacancy occurs in the governing body of a special district, the legislative authority of the county within which the special district, or the largest portion of the special district, is located, shall appoint a district voter to serve until a person is elected, at the next special district general election occurring sixty or more days after the vacancy has occurred, to serve the remainder of the unexpired term. The person so elected shall take office immediately when qualified as defined in RCW 29A.04.133.

If an election for the position which became vacant would otherwise have been held at this special district election, only one election shall be held and the person elected to fill the succeeding term for that position shall take office immediately when qualified as defined in RCW 29A.04.133 and shall serve both the remainder of the unexpired term and the succeeding term. A vacancy occurs upon the death, resignation, or incapacity of a governing body member or whenever the governing body member ceases being a qualified voter of the special district.

6. An elected or appointed member of a special district governing body, or a candidate for a special district governing body, must be a qualified voter of the special district: PROVIDED, That the state, its agencies and political subdivisions, or their designees under RCW 85.38.010(3) shall not be eligible for election or appointment.

## 85.38.075 - Governing body—Compensation and expenses.
The members of the governing body may each receive up to ninety dollars per day or portion thereof spent in actual attendance at official meetings of the governing body or in performance of other official services or duties on behalf of the district. The governing body shall fix the compensation to be paid to the members, secretary, and all other agents and employees of the district. Compensation for the members shall not exceed eight thousand six hundred forty dollars in one calendar year. A member is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with such business, including subsistence and lodging, while away from the member's place of residence, and mileage for use of a privately owned vehicle in accordance with chapter 42.24 RCW.

Any member may waive all or any portion of his or her compensation payable under this section as to any month or months during his or her term of office, by a written waiver filed with the secretary as provided in this section. The waiver, to be effective, must be filed any time after the member's election and prior to the date on which the compensation would otherwise be paid. The waiver shall specify the month or period of months for which it is made.

The dollar thresholds established in this section must be adjusted for inflation by the office of financial management every five years, beginning January 1, 2024, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. "Consumer price index" means, for any calendar year, that year's annual average consumer price index, for Washington state, for wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the bureau of labor and statistics, United States department of labor. If the bureau of labor and statistics develops more than one consumer price index for areas within the state, the index covering the greatest number of people, covering areas exclusively within the boundaries of the state, and including all items shall be used for the adjustments for inflation in this section. The office of financial management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the office of the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect.

A person holding office as commissioner for two or more special purpose districts shall receive only that per diem compensation authorized for one of his or her commissioner positions as compensation for attending an official meeting or conducting official services or duties while representing more than one of his or her districts. However, such commissioner may receive additional per diem compensation if approved by resolution of all boards of the affected commissions.

The bond shall be in the sum of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, as determined by the county legislative authority of the county within which the special district, or the largest portion of the special district, is located. The bond shall be conditioned on the faithful performance of his or her duties as a member of the governing body of the special district and shall be filed with the county clerk of the county within which the special district, or the largest portion of the special district, is located.

\[ [1987 c 298 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c298.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20298%20§%203); [1985 c 396 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c396.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20396%20§%209); \]

## 85.38.090 - Governing body—Reduction in size.
1. Whenever the governing body of a special district has more than three members, the governing body shall be reduced to three members as of January 1, 1986, by eliminating the positions of those district governing body members with the shortest remaining terms of office. The remaining three governing body members shall have staggered terms with the one having the shortest remaining term having his or her position filled at the 1987 special district general election, the one with the next shortest remaining term having his or her position filled at the 1989 special district general election, and the one with the longest remaining term having his or her position filled at the 1992 special district general election. If any of these remaining three governing body members have identical remaining terms of office, the newly calculated remaining terms of these persons shall be determined by lot with the county auditor who assists the special district in its elections managing such lot procedure. The newly established terms shall be recorded by the county auditor.

2. However, whenever five or more special districts have consolidated under chapter 85.36 RCW and the consolidated district has five members in its governing body on July 28, 1985, the consolidated district may adopt a resolution retaining a five-member governing body. At any time thereafter, such a district may adopt a resolution and reduce the size of the governing body to three members with the reduction occurring as provided in subsection (1) of this section, but the years of the effective dates shall be extended so that the reduction occurs at the next January 1st occurring after the date of the adoption of the resolution. Whenever a special district is so governed by a five-member governing body, two members shall be elected at each of two consecutive special district general elections, and one member shall be elected at the following special district general election, each to serve a six-year staggered term.

3. Nothing in this section permits the governing body of a flood control district that is subject to RCW 85.38.290 to reduce the size of its governing body.

## 85.38.130 - Election officials—Duties—Voting hours—Challenged ballots—Absentee ballots.
For special district elections that are not conducted by mail, the governing body of each special district shall appoint three voters of the special district, who may be members of the governing body, to act as election officials, unless the special district contracts with the county auditor to staff the election site. The election officials shall distribute a ballot or ballots to each voter of the special district who arrives at the voting place during the hours for the election on the day of the election and requests a ballot. Ballots shall also be provided to those persons arriving at the polling place during the hours for the election on the day of the election who present documents or evidence sufficient to establish their eligibility to vote. A person arriving at the polling place at such times who demands a ballot, but who fails to present documents or evidence which in the opinion of the election officials is sufficient to establish eligibility to vote, shall be given a ballot clearly marked as "challenged" and shall be allowed to vote. Each challenged ballot shall be numbered consecutively and a list of such persons and their ballot numbers shall be made.

The governing body of each special district shall designate those hours from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. during which the election shall be held: PROVIDED, That at least six consecutive hours must be designated. When the election is over, the election officials shall secure the ballots and transport the ballots to the county auditor's office by noon of the day following the election. The auditor may, at his or her discretion, station a deputy auditor or auditors at the election site who shall observe the election and transport the ballots to the auditor's office. The auditor shall count the ballots and certify the count of votes for and against each measure and for each candidate appearing on the ballot. A separate count shall be made of any challenged ballots. A challenged ballot shall be counted as a normal ballot if documents or evidence are supplied to the auditor before 4:00 p.m. on the day after the election that, in the opinion of the auditor, are sufficient to establish the person's eligibility to vote.

Additionally, voting by absentee ballot shall be allowed in every special district. A request for an absentee ballot may be made by an eligible voter by mail or in person to the county auditor who supervises the special district elections. An absentee ballot shall be provided to each voter of a special district requesting such a ballot under this section. A person requesting such a ballot may present information establishing his or her eligibility to vote in such a special district. The auditor shall provide an absentee ballot to each person requesting an absentee ballot who is either included on the list of presumed eligible voters or who submits information which, in the auditor's opinion, establishes his or her eligibility to vote. The names of these persons so determined to be eligible to vote shall be added to the list of presumed eligible voters for the appropriate special district. The request for an absentee ballot must be made no more than forty-five days before the election. To be valid, absentee ballots must be postmarked on or before the day of the election and mailed to the county auditor.

## 85.38.140 - Special district financing—Alternative method.
The process by which budgets are adopted, special assessments are measured and imposed, rates and charges are fixed, and assessment zones are established, as provided in RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170, shall constitute an alternative optional method of financing special districts. A special district in existence prior to July 28, 1985, may conform with RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170 when its governing body adopts a resolution indicating its intention to conform with such laws. Whenever such a resolution is adopted, or a new special district is created on or after July 28, 1985, RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170 shall be the exclusive method by which the special district measures and imposes special assessments and adopts its budget. The governing body of a special district that was created before July 28, 1985, and which operates under RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170, may adopt a resolution removing the special district from operating under RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170, and operate under alternative procedures available to the special district. A county may charge a special district for costs the county incurs in establishing a system or systems of assessment for the special district pursuant to RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170.

## 85.38.145 - Rates and charges.
Regardless of whether any special assessments have been or may be imposed on a particular parcel of real property pursuant to this chapter, in order to implement the authority granted under RCW 85.38.180(3), a special district may fix rates and charges payable by owners or occupiers of real estate within the special district. When fixing rates and charges, the district may consider the degree to which activities on a parcel of real property, including on-site septic systems, contribute to the problems that the special district is authorized to address under RCW 85.38.180(3).

\[ [1993 c 464 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2008.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20464%20§%204); \]

## 85.38.150 - Special assessments—Valuation—Assessment zones—Criteria for assessments.
1. Special district special assessments shall be imposed only on real property within the district that uses or will use the special district's facilities or receives or will receive special benefits from the special district's operations and facilities. Both privately owned and publicly owned real property, including real property owned by the state, is subject to these special assessments. Mobile homes located on real property within a special district shall be considered an improvement to the real property for purposes of imposing special assessments.

2. Special assessments imposed upon real property, other than improvements, shall be a function of the dollar value of benefit or use per acre and the assessment zone in which the real property is located. Special assessments imposed upon an improvement shall be a function of the dollar value of benefit or use assigned to the type or class of improvements and the assessment zone in which the improvement is located.

3. Assessment zones shall be established in which each zone reflects a different relative ratio of benefit or use that the real property within such a zone receives, or will receive, from the special district's operations and facilities. That real property receiving the greatest benefits, or which uses the special district's facilities to the greatest extent, shall be placed into class No. 1 and assigned a value of one hundred percent; that real property receiving the next greatest benefits, or which uses the special district's facilities to the next greatest extent, shall be placed into class No. 2 and assigned a lower percentage value; and so on, extending to the class of least benefits or use. That real property receiving no benefits or use shall be designated "nonbenefit." If all real property in the special district is found to have the same relative ratio of benefit or use, a single assessment zone may be established.

4. Any one or more of the following criteria shall be used in measuring the manifest degrees or ratios of benefit or use: (a) Proximity to the special district's facilities; (b) height above or below dikes and levees; (c) easier accessibility; (d) facility of drainage; (e) minimization of flood or inundation damage; (f) actual flood protection; (g) use of the special district's facilities; and (h) any other criteria established by the county under RCW 85.38.160 that measure manifest degrees of benefit or use from the special district's facilities and operations.

5. Special assessments may be imposed to pay for the construction, repair, and maintenance of special district facilities and for special district operations. Administrative and operational costs of the special district shall be proportionally included in these special assessments.

## 85.38.160 - Systems of assessment—Hearing—Notice—Adoption of ordinance—Appeals—Review—Emergency assessment.
1. The county within which each special district is located shall establish a system or systems of assessment for the special district as provided in this section. A differing system of assessment shall be established for different classes of facilities that a special district provides or will provide, including a separate system of assessment for diking and drainage facilities if both classes of facilities are provided. Whenever a special district is located in more than one county, the county within which the largest portion of the special district is located shall establish the system or systems of assessment for the entire special district. A system of assessment shall include assessment zones, the acreage included in each assessment zone, a dollar value of benefit or use per acre, and various classes or types of improvements together with a dollar value of benefit or use for an improvement included in each of the classes or types of improvements. The county shall establish which improvements shall be subject to special assessments and shall establish one or more types or classes of such improvements.

2. The engineer of the county shall prepare a preliminary system or systems of assessment for each special district. Each system of assessment that is prepared for a special district shall be designed to generate a total of one thousand dollars in revenue for the special district.

The preliminary system or systems of assessment shall be filed with the county legislative authority. A public hearing on the preliminary system or systems of assessment shall be held by the county legislative authority. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper, in general circulation in the special district, for two consecutive weeks with the final notice being published not less than fourteen, nor more than twenty-one days, before the public hearing. Notice shall also be mailed to each owner or reputed owner, as shown on the assessor's tax rolls, of each lot or parcel subject to such assessments. The mailed notice shall indicate the amount of assessment on the lot or parcel that, together with all other assessments in the system of assessment, would raise one thousand dollars. The mailed notice shall indicate that this assessment amount is not being imposed, but is a hypothetical assessment that, if combined with all other hypothetical assessments in the system of assessment, would generate one thousand dollars, and that this hypothetical assessment is proposed to be used to establish a system or systems of assessment for the special district. Where a special district currently is imposing special assessments and a property owner's property is subject to these special assessments, the mailed notice to this property owner also shall use the hypothetical special assessment in conjunction with the total special assessments imposed by the special district in that year to provide a comparison special assessment value to the property owner. This notice shall indicate that the comparison special assessment value is not being imposed, and should be considered for comparative purposes only. Where a special district is not currently imposing special assessments, the mailed notice may include, if deemed appropriate by the county engineer and if such figures are available, an estimated special assessment value for the property owner's property using this hypothetical special assessment in conjunction with special district-wide level of special assessments that possibly would be imposed in the following year. Where a county is imposing rates and charges for stormwater or surface water control facilities pursuant to chapters 36.89 or 36.94 RCW, the county shall credit such rates and charges with assessments imposed under this section by a special district to fund drainage facilities and the maintenance of drainage facilities.

3. The county legislative authority shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary system or systems of assessment on the day specified in the notices. Persons objecting to the preliminary system or systems of assessment may present their objections at this public hearing, which may be continued if necessary. The county legislative authority shall adopt an ordinance finalizing the system or systems of assessment after making any changes that in its discretion are necessary. The county legislative authority shall have broad discretion in establishing systems of assessment. The decision of the county legislative authority shall be final, except for appeals. Any person objecting to the system or systems of assessment must appeal such decision to the superior court of the county within which all, or the largest portion, of the special district is located within twenty days of the adoption of the ordinance.

4. The system or systems of assessment of each special district shall be reviewed by the county engineer and finalized by the county legislative authority at least once every four years. A system or systems of assessment shall be finalized on or before the first of September in the year that it is finalized. The legislative authority of a county that is responsible for establishing a system or systems of assessment for more than one special district may, at its option, stagger the initial finalization of such systems of assessment for different special districts over a period of up to four years. Assessments shall be collected in special districts pursuant to the district's previous system of assessment until the system or systems of assessment under this chapter is finalized under this section.

5. New improvements shall be noted by the special district as they are made and shall be subject to special assessments in the year after the improvement is made.

6. The county legislative authority, upon request by a special district, may authorize the special district to impose and collect emergency assessments pursuant to the special district's system or systems of assessment whenever the emergent protection of life or property is necessary.

\[ [1985 c 396 § 17](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c396.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20396%20§%2017); \]

## 85.38.165 - Applicable assessed value.
1. Every special district must use the assessed value applicable to forestland, farm and agricultural land, or open space land, under chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW, when the land has been designated as such and the assessed value is used as a component in determining the district assessment.

2. If a district uses a fractional amount of assessed value as a component in determining the district assessment, then a fractional amount of the value applicable to forestland, farm and agricultural land, or open space land, under chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW, shall be used.

## 85.38.170 - Budgets—Special assessments—Notice—Delinquent special assessments—Collection fee.
Budgets for each special district shall be adopted, and special assessments imposed, annually for the succeeding calendar year. On or before December 1st of each year, the governing body of the special district shall adopt a resolution approving a budget for the succeeding year and special assessments sufficient to finance the budget. A copy of the resolution and the budget shall be forwarded immediately to the county legislative authority of the county or counties within which the special district is located and to the treasurer of the county or counties in which the special district is located. Special assessments necessary to generate funds for this budget shall be imposed pursuant to the system or systems of assessment established by the county. Special assessments shall be collected by the county treasurer or treasurers within which the special district is located. Notice of the special assessments due may be included on the notice of property taxes due, may be included on a separate notice that is mailed with the notice of property taxes due, or may be sent separately from the notice of property taxes due. Special assessments shall be due at the same time property taxes are due and shall constitute liens on the land or improvements upon which they are imposed. Delinquent special assessments shall be foreclosed in the same manner, and subject to the same time schedules, interest, and penalties as delinquent property taxes. County treasurers may impose a fee for collecting special assessments not to exceed one percent of the dollar value of special assessments collected.

2. Property in the territory withdrawn from the boundaries of a special district under this section shall remain liable for any special assessments of the special district from which it was withdrawn, if the special assessments are associated with bonds or notes used to finance facilities serving the property, to the same extent as if the withdrawal of property had not occurred.

## 85.38.215 - Transfer of territory from one special district to another.
Territory that is located in one special district may be transferred from that special district to another special district as provided in this section, if a portion of this territory is coterminous with a portion of the boundaries of the special district to which it is transferred. Such a transfer shall be accomplished using the procedures in RCW 85.38.200 for annexing territory, except that the governing body of both special districts must approve the transfer and make findings that the transfer is in the public interest and that the special district to which the territory is transferred is better able to provide the activities and facilities serving the territory than the special district from which the territory is transferred.

Property in the territory so transferred shall remain liable for any special assessments of the special district from which it was transferred, if the special assessments are associated with bonds or notes used to finance facilities serving the property, to the same extent as if the transfer had not occurred.

A public hearing on the proposed action shall be held by the county legislative authority at which it shall inquire into whether such action is in the public interest. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the special district, posted in at least four locations in the special district to attract the attention of the public, and mailed to the members of the governing body of the special district, if there are any. After the public hearing, the county legislative authority may adopt a resolution suspending the operations of the special district if it finds such suspension to be in the public interest, and shall provide a copy of the resolution to the county treasurer. When a special district is located in more than one county, the legislative authority of each of such counties must so act before the operations of the special district are suspended.

After holding a public hearing on the proposed reactivation of a special district that has had its operations suspended, the legislative authority or authorities of the county or counties in which the special district is located may reactivate the special district by adopting a resolution finding such action to be in the public interest. Notice of the public hearing shall be posted and published as provided for the public hearing on a proposed suspension of a special district's operations. The governing body of a reactivated special district shall be appointed as in a newly created special district.

No special district that owns drainage or flood control improvements may be suspended unless the legislative authority of a county accepts responsibility for operation and maintenance of the improvements during the suspension period.
