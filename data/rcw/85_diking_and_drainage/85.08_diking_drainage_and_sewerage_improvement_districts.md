In the construction of any system of drainage, construction shall be begun at the outlet or outlets thereof and at such other points as may be deemed advisable from time to time. In the construction of any system of improvement the board of supervisors with the approval of the board of county commissioners may modify, curtail, enlarge or add to the original plans wherever the same may be found necessary or advisable in the course of actual construction. But such changes shall not in the aggregate increase the estimated cost of the entire system by more than one-fifth, and all additional or different rights-of-way required shall be obtained as hereinbefore prescribed. The board of county commissioners may in its discretion let the construction of said system or any portion thereof by contract, in the manner provided for letting contracts for the construction of county roads and bridges. The board of county commissioners may, upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the United States acting in pursuance of the National Reclamation Act approved June 17, 1902 (32 Statutes at Large 388), and the acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, or in pursuance to any other act of congress appropriate to the purpose, contract for the construction of the system of improvement or any part thereof, by the United States, or in cooperation with the United States therein. In such case, no bond shall be required, and the work shall be done under the supervision and control of the proper officers of the United States.

Unless the work of construction is let by contract as hereinbefore provided, or for such part of such work as is not covered by contract, the board of supervisors shall employ such number of persons as shall be necessary to successfully carry on the work of such construction, and shall give preference in such employment to persons owning land to be benefited by the improvement.

The provisions of this section shall not be construed as denying to the supervisors, in case the construction work is left in their hands, the power to enter into an agreement with any contractor to furnish labor, material, equipment and skilled supervision, the contractor to be compensated upon the basis of a specific sum, or upon a percentage of the cost of the work, the services of the contractor to cover the use of equipment and the value of skilled supervision: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That there is retained in the said board by the contract the right of termination thereof at any time, on reasonable notice, and fixing in the said contract, or reserving in said board, the right to fix the rates of wages to be paid to the persons employed in said work. The board of supervisors may also let contracts in such manner and on such notice as they deem advisable for items of construction not exceeding one thousand dollars in amount of expenditures.

## 85.08.320 - Compensation and expenses of officers and employees—Costs paid by voucher, payroll, or warrant.
The compensation of the superintendent of construction, the board of appraisers hereinafter provided for, and any special engineer, attorney or agent employed by the district in connection with the improvement, the maximum wages to be paid, and the maximum price of materials to be used, shall be fixed by the district board of supervisors. Members of the board of supervisors may receive compensation up to ninety dollars per day or portion thereof spent in actual attendance at official meetings of the district, or in performance of other official services or duties on behalf of the district: PROVIDED, That such compensation shall not exceed eight thousand six hundred forty dollars in one calendar year. Each supervisor shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with business, including subsistence and lodging while away from the supervisor's place of residence and mileage for use of a privately owned vehicle in accordance with chapter 42.24 RCW. All costs of construction or maintenance done under the direction of the board of supervisors shall be paid upon vouchers or payrolls verified by two of the said supervisors. All costs of construction and all other expenses, fees and charges on account of such improvement shall be paid by warrants drawn by the county auditor upon the county treasurer upon the proper fund, and shall draw interest at a rate determined by the county legislative authority until paid or called by the county treasurer as warrants of the county are called.

Any supervisor may waive all or any portion of his or her compensation payable under this section as to any month or months during his or her term of office, by a written waiver filed with the secretary as provided in this section. The waiver, to be effective, must be filed any time after the supervisor's election and prior to the date on which the compensation would otherwise be paid.

## 85.08.340 - Crossing roads or public utilities—Procedure—Costs.
Whenever in the progress of the construction of the system of improvement it shall become necessary to construct a portion of such system across any public or other road or public utility, the board of supervisors, or in case the work is being done by contract the board of county commissioners, shall serve notice in writing upon the public officers, corporation, or person having charge of, or controlling or owning such road or public utility, as the case may be, of the present necessity of such crossing, giving the location, kind, dimensions, and requirement thereof, for the purpose of the system of improvement, and stating a reasonable time, to be fixed by the county engineer, within which plans for such crossing must be filed for approval in case the public officers, corporation, or person controlling or owning such road or public utility desire to construct such crossing. As soon as convenient, within the time fixed in the notice, the public officers, corporation, or person shall, if they desire to construct such crossing, prepare and submit to the county engineer for approval duplicate detailed plans and specifications for such crossing. Upon submission of such plans, the county engineer shall examine and may modify the same to meet the requirements of the system of improvement, and when such plans or modified plans are satisfactory to the county engineer, he or she shall approve the same and return one thereof to the public officers, corporation, or person submitting the same, and file the duplicate in his or her office, and shall notify such public officers, corporation, or person of the time within which said crossing must be constructed. Upon the return of such approved plans, the public officers, corporation, or person controlling such road or public utility shall, within the time fixed by the county engineer, construct such crossing in accordance with the approved plans, and shall thereafter maintain the same. In case such public officers, corporation, or person controlling or owning such road or public utility shall fail to file plans for such crossing within the time prescribed in the notice, the board of supervisors or of county commissioners, as the case may be, shall proceed with the construction of such crossing in such manner as will cause no unnecessary injury to or interference with such road or public utility. The cost of construction and maintenance of only such crossings or such portion of such cost as would not have been necessary but for the construction of the system of improvement shall be a proper charge against the improvement district, and only so much of such cost as the board of county commissioners shall deem reasonable shall be allowed as a charge against the district in the case of crossings constructed by others than the district. The amount of costs of construction allowed as a charge against the district by the board of county commissioners shall be credited on the assessments against the property on which the crossing is constructed, and any excess over such assessment shall be paid out of the funds of the district.

If upon the foreclosure of the assessment upon any property the same shall not sell for enough to pay the assessment against it, or if any property assessed was not subject to assessment, or if any assessment made shall have been eliminated by foreclosure of a tax lien or made void in any other manner, the board of county commissioners shall cause a supplemental assessment to be made on the property benefited by the improvement, including property upon which any assessment shall have been so eliminated or made void, and against the county, cities and towns chargeable therewith in the manner provided for the original assessment, to cover the deficiency so caused in the original assessment.

If by inadvertence or for any cause the assessment levied shall be found to be insufficient to meet the entire cost of construction, a supplemental assessment shall be made by the board of county commissioners upon the lands of the district in the same proportion as the original assessment is levied, same being spread over not to exceed three years as the commissioners may determine.

Duplicate assessments or other errors that may by inadvertence be found to have been incorporated in the assessment roll may be corrected by order of the county commissioners upon same being certified to them by the treasurer and the engineer.

The amount of the costs of construction or maintenance of any system of improvement assessed against any city, town or county may be met by levies to be paid in similar installments and extending over a like period of time as the assessments against property benefited are spread, or such amounts may be met by the issue and sale of the bonds of such city, town or county in the manner in which bonds to meet general indebtedness of such city, town or county are issued. The proper authorities of such city, town or county shall make the necessary levies to meet such amounts thus apportioned thereto as a general levy on all property therein.

## 85.08.540 - Abandonment or change in system—Subdistricts.
Upon a petition and bond being filed by one or more landowners, either within or without the boundaries of a district, and like proceedings being had as in the case of the original establishment and construction of a system of improvement, the county commissioners may declare any system of improvement or any part thereof, abandoned or may strike from the district lands no longer benefited or served thereby, or they may cause any system of improvement to be altered, reduced, enlarged, added to or in any other manner bettered or improved, either within or without the district, and to effect such subsequent improvements, may exercise any of the powers which are in this chapter, or may be hereafter conferred upon such districts. But the striking of any lands from a district shall not in any way affect any assessment theretofore levied against such lands. When such improvements shall have been completed the costs thereof shall be apportioned and assessed against the lands benefited thereby in the manner hereinbefore provided for such apportionment and assessment in the case of original proceedings. New lands assessed for any such improvement shall become a part of such district. The construction and maintenance of any such new improvement, unless let by contract by the board of county commissioners, shall be under the direction of the board of supervisors of the district in which they are made or to which said improvement is added. The lands assessed for such new improvements, of less than the entire district, shall be designated, alphabetically, "subdistrict . . . . . . of . . . . . . improvement district No. . . . . ."

## 85.08.560 - Extension of existing system—Apportionment of cost.
When any extension of or addition to any existing system of improvement shall be thus constructed, the cost thereof shall be assessed to all the property, counties, cities and towns in the enlarged district benefited thereby in proportion to the benefits received therefrom. Any new lands thus brought into the district shall be assessed in addition a proper and equitable share of the then value of the original system of improvement in proportion to the benefits which such new lands derive therefrom. In determining the value to be so assessed the board of appraisers shall take into consideration the amount, if any, which the property to be assessed has already paid toward the construction of the original system and all other matters that may be pertinent. If at any time it shall appear to the board of supervisors of any drainage or diking improvement district that any lands without the boundaries of such district are being benefited by the improvements of the district and are not being assessed for the benefits received, they shall file a petition with the board of county commissioners praying the benefits received by such lands be determined and an assessment made upon such lands for the benefits so received. Thereupon, the board of county commissioners shall appoint a board of appraisers as provided in RCW 85.08.360 for the apportionment of the cost of construction of the original system of improvement, and an apportionment of the then value of the improvements of the district shall be made to such lands in proportion to the benefits received therefrom as nearly as may be in the manner provided for the apportionment of the cost of the original system of improvement. In determining what share of the value of the improvements of the district shall be apportioned to such lands the board of appraisers shall take into consideration the benefits already received by such lands and all other matters that may be pertinent. The amount of the value of the original system assessed upon any new property brought within the district shall be rebated pro rata upon the assessments, if any, outstanding against the lands of the district on account of the construction of such original system. If the assessment against any land has been paid in full, or if the assessment remaining outstanding against such land is less than the rebate apportioned to such land, the amount so rebated or excess of rebate over assessment shall be paid into the maintenance fund of the district and a proper credit on any existing or future assessment for maintenance shall be entered in favor of the land entitled thereto. The lands in the original district shall remain bound for the whole of the original unpaid assessment thereon for the payment of any outstanding unpaid warrants or bonds secured to be paid by such assessments.

## 85.08.565 - Special assessments—Budgets—Alternative methods.
RCW 85.38.140 through 85.38.170 constitute a mutually exclusive alternative method by which diking, drainage, or sewerage improvement districts in existence as of July 28, 1985, may measure and impose special assessments and adopt budgets.

## 85.08.570 - Districts in two or more counties—Notice—Hearings.
When a drainage, diking, or sewerage system is proposed which will require a location, or the assessment of lands, in more than one county, application therefor shall be made to the board of county commissioners in each of said counties, and the county engineers shall make preliminary reports for their respective counties. The lines of such proposed improvement shall be examined by the county engineers of the counties wherein said improvements will lie, jointly. The hearings in regard to such improvements, provided for by RCW * 85.08.150, and 85.08.400 through 85.08.430 shall be had by the boards of county commissioners of the two counties in joint sessions, and all other matters required to be done by the county commissioners in regard to such improvement and the improvement district shall be had and done by the boards of county commissioners of the counties wherein such system of improvements shall lie, either in joint session at such place as the said board shall order, or by concurrent order entered into by the said boards at their respective offices. Notice of the hearings shall be given by the auditors of both counties jointly by publication in the official paper of each of said counties.

The auditor of the county in which the greater length of the drainage, diking, or sewerage system shall lie shall act as clerk of the joint session of the boards of county commissioners, and shall issue the warrants of the improvement district, and shall attest the signatures of the two boards of county commissioners on the bonds. He or she shall furnish to the auditor of the other county duplicate copies of the records of proceedings of such joint sessions. Duplicate records of all proceedings had and papers filed in connection with such improvements shall be kept, one with the auditor of each county. Protests or other papers filed with the auditor who is not clerk of the joint sessions shall be forwarded forthwith by him or her to the auditor who acts as clerk of such joint sessions. The treasurer of said county shall register and certify and pay the warrants and the bonds, and shall have charge of the funds of the district; and to him or her, the treasurer of the county in which the lesser portion of such system of improvements lie, shall remit semiannually, in time for the semiannual warrant and bond calls, all such collections made in such other county. A drainage, diking, or sewerage improvement district lying in more than one county shall be designated "joint drainage (or diking) or sewerage improvement district No. . . . . of . . . . . . and . . . . . . counties."
