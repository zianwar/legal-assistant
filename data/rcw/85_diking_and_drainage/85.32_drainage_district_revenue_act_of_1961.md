## 85.32.010 - Declaration of necessity and purpose.
The maintenance of drainage districts is essential to the economy of the state. The influx of population and changes in land use since many such districts were formed, has made obsolete and unjust the method used under existing law to provide funds for the operation of such districts and for the maintenance and expansion of its drainage systems. Also, in many instances, properties lying outside of the territorial limits of such districts, have been and are being developed in such a manner that waters therefrom, through artificial rather than natural processes, are accumulated and discharged for outlet upon lands within such districts, and the facilities of such district are used without charge to furnish service and benefit to such lands. To furnish remedy for such situations where they are found to exist the state declares that it has an interest therein and this chapter is passed.

\[ [1961 c 131 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c131.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20131%20§%202); \]

## 85.32.020 - Definitions.
As used in this chapter:

"District" means a regularly formed and established drainage district under the provisions of this title.

"Board" means the board of commissioners of a regularly formed and established drainage district under the provisions of this title.

\[ [1961 c 131 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c131.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20131%20§%203); \]

## 85.32.030 - Powers of board in general.
The board may: (1) Make initial determination that the district's facilities furnish benefit to improvements upon land as well as land alone within the district in protecting against and furnishing runoff for surface and/or flood waters; (2) make initial determination that lands and improvements thereon outside of the territorial limits of the district are receiving a service from the facilities of the district, and are benefited thereby in that waters from such lands through ditches, drains, or other artificial methods, other than by natural flow or seepage, are so cast as to have outlet through the district's facilities; (3) determine that properties so found to be served should pay a just proportion of the operational and maintenance costs of the district; (4) in connection with so finding, cause a roll of property thus served and benefited by the district's facilities to be prepared and filed with it, and give notice of a hearing thereon as provided in this chapter; (5) hold public hearings to determine the ultimate facts and approve an ultimate roll of properties served and benefited by the facilities of the district and valuations thereof to serve as a basis against which annual dollar rate levy may be assessed for continuous benefits furnished such properties; make revision thereof as the facts warrant from time to time; provide for the levying of such dollar rate levy; and make return of such roll finally adopted by certifying and filing a copy thereof with the auditor, assessor and treasurer of the county wherein the properties involved are located.

\[ [1973 1st ex.s. c 195 § 120](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c195.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20195%20§%20120); [1961 c 131 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c131.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20131%20§%204); \]

## 85.32.040 - Initial determination—Roll—Resolution, contents.
In the initial instance, when the board of any district, desires to use the method and procedure provided in this chapter, and in order that uniformity may be had, it may cause a roll of all properties within the district claimed to be benefited by its drainage system, and in addition or as a part thereof, a roll of all properties outside of the territorial limits of said district claimed to be served and benefited by the drainage systems of said district, to be prepared and filed with it. Thereupon, the board shall by resolution declare:

1. That it has made initial determination that the district's facilities are furnishing and will furnish service and benefit to the properties, including improvements thereon, described in such roll;

2. That such roll has been filed with it and will remain so filed and open to inspection by any party interested therein at all reasonable times;

3. That a public hearing will be held by the board at a time and place stated to give consideration to the facts and make ultimate determination of the same and to said roll;

4. That when said roll is finally adopted, annual dollar rate levies will be made by the district against said properties based upon the valuation thereof as shown on said roll when ultimately adopted to raise money based on benefit and service for the continuous operation and maintenance of said district;

5. That at the time of hearing, it will hear all objections filed and will review, adopt, modify, or revise said roll consistent with existing facts to the end that property receiving service and benefit from the facilities of the district shall pay justly and equitably therefor in proportion to benefit received and;

6. That upon said hearing or adjournments thereof, the board will determine the ultimate facts concerning service and benefit received by all properties ultimately contained in said roll and as to such properties it will adopt the roll in final form and proceed as in this chapter provided.

\[ [1973 1st ex.s. c 195 § 121](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c195.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20195%20§%20121); [1961 c 131 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c131.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20131%20§%205); \]

## 85.32.050 - Contents of roll—Assessed, equalized value prima facie correct—Separate levies for prior indebtedness—Adjustment of roll.
The roll of properties referred to in this chapter shall contain (1) a description of all properties and improvements thereon, with the name of the owner or the reputed owner thereof and his or her address as shown on the tax rolls of the assessor or treasurer of the county wherein the property is located, and (2) the determined value of such land and improvements thereon as last assessed and equalized by the taxing agencies of such county. Such assessed and equalized values shall be deemed prima facie as a just, fair, and correct base of value for consideration by the board in its determination ultimately of the just and correct base of value in each instance against which annual dollar rates shall be levied by the district for the operation of the district and the expansion and maintenance of its facilities.

If property outside of the territorial limits of the district are upon the roll as adopted ultimately, and the district has prior indebtedness existing, the board shall set up separate dollar rate levies for the retirement thereof until it is extinguished, which levies shall be applied solely against the properties within the territorial limits of the district. Adjustments of the roll shall be made before final adoption in such a manner that the money raised through annual dollar rate levies for maintenance, expansion, and operational costs of the district in no instance shall exceed the value of the service rendered or to be rendered and the benefit received and to be received by the property involved.

## 85.32.120 - Levy for outstanding indebtedness.
If any property outside of the territorial limits of the district is placed upon a roll as finally adopted, and at the time such property becomes subject to charge for service and benefit from the district's system, there is an existing outstanding indebtedness owing by the district, the board shall make a separate estimate of the revenue required to be raised to pay or apply upon such indebtedness until it is extinguished, and it shall proceed and certify the same as hereinabove provided, and no dollar rate for raising revenue to extinguish such indebtedness shall be included in the levies made against any properties lying outside of the territorial limits of said district.

When thus levied, the amount of assessment produced thereby shall be added by the general taxing authorities to the general taxes against said lands and collected therewith as a part thereof.

\[ [1961 c 131 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c131.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20131%20§%2014); \]
