Any or all of said defendants may appear jointly or separately and admit or deny the allegations of said petition and plead any affirmative matter in defense thereof at the time and place appointed for hearing said petition, or to which the same may have been adjourned. If the court or judge thereof shall have satisfactory proof that all of the defendants in said action have been duly served with said summons, as above provided, and shall be further satisfied by competent proof that said improvement is practicable and conducive to the public health, welfare, and convenience, and will increase the value of said lands for the purpose of public revenue, and that the contemplated use for which the land, real estate, premises, or other property sought to be appropriated is really a public use, and that the land, real estate, premises, or other property sought to be appropriated are required and necessary for the establishment of said improvement, and that said improvement has a good and sufficient outlet, the court or judge thereof shall cause a jury of twelve qualified persons to be impaneled to assess the damages and benefits, as herein provided, if in attendance upon his or her court; and if not he or she may, if satisfied that the public interests require the immediate construction of said improvement, direct the sheriff of his or her county to summons from the citizens of the county in which petition is filed as many qualified persons as may be necessary in order to form a jury of twelve persons, unless the parties to the proceedings consent to a less number, such number to be not less than three, and such consent shall be entered by the clerk in the minutes of the trial. If necessary, to complete the jury in any case, the sheriff, under the directions of the court or the judge thereof shall summon as many qualified persons as may be required to complete the jury from the citizens of the county in which the petition is filed.

## 85.06.130 - Assessment of benefited lands formerly omitted—Procedure—Appeals.
If at any time it shall appear to the board of drainage commissioners that any lands within or without said district as originally established are being benefited by the drainage system of said district and that said lands are not being assessed for the benefits received, or if after the construction of any drainage system, it appears that lands embraced therein have in fact received or are receiving benefits different from those found in the original proceedings, and which could not reasonably have been foreseen before the final completion of the improvement, or that any lands within said district are being assessed out of or not in proportion to the benefits which said lands are receiving from the maintenance of the drainage system of said district, and said board of drainage commissioners shall determine that certain lands, either within or without the boundaries of the district as originally established, should be assessed for the purpose of raising funds for the future maintenance of the drainage system of the district, or that the assessments on land already assessed should be equalized by diminishing or increasing the same so that said lands shall be assessed in proportion to the benefits received, said commissioners shall file a petition in the superior court in the original cause, setting forth the facts, describing the lands not previously assessed and the lands the assessment on which should be equalized, stating the estimated amount of benefits per acre being received by each tract of land respectively, giving the name of the owner or reputed owner of each such tract of land and praying that such original cause be opened for further proceedings for the purpose of subjecting new lands to assessments or equalizing the assessments upon lands already assessed, or both. Upon the filing of such petition, summons shall issue thereon and be served on the owners of all lands affected, in the same manner as summons is issued and served in original proceedings, as near as may be, and if such new lands lie within the boundaries of any other drainage district, said summons shall also be served upon the commissioners of such other drainage district. In case any of the new lands sought to be assessed in said proceeding lie within the boundaries of any other drainage district, and the drainage commissioners of such other district believe that the maintenance of the drain or drains of such other district is benefiting lands within the district instituting the proceeding, said drainage commissioners of such other districts shall intervene in such proceedings by petition, setting forth the facts, describing the lands in the district instituting the proceeding which they believe are being benefited by the maintenance of the drainage system of their district, and praying that the benefits to such lands may be determined and such lands subjected to assessment for the further maintenance of the drainage system of their district, to the end that all questions of benefits to lands in the respective districts may be settled and determined in one proceeding, and such petitioners in intervention shall cause summons to be issued upon such petition in intervention and served upon the commissioners of the drainage district instituting the proceeding and upon the owners of all lands sought to be affected by such petition in intervention. In case the owner of any such new lands sought to be assessed in said proceedings shall be maintaining a private drain against salt or fresh water for the benefit of said lands, and shall believe that the maintenance of such private drain is benefiting any lands within or without the district instituting the proceedings, or in case any such new lands sought to be assessed are included within the boundaries of some other drainage district and are being assessed for the maintenance of the drains of such other district, and the owner of such lands believes that the maintenance of the drain or drains of such other district is benefiting lands included within the district instituting said proceedings, such owner or owners may by answer and cross-petition set forth the facts and pray that at the hearing upon said petition and cross-petition the benefits accruing from the maintenance of the respective drains may be considered, to the end that a fair and equitable adjustment of the benefits being received by any lands from the maintenance of the various drains benefiting the same, may be determined for the purpose of fixing the assessments for the future maintenance of such drains, and may interplead in said proceeding such other drainage district in which his or her lands sought to be assessed in said proceeding are being assessed for the maintenance of the drain or drains of such other district. No answer to any petition or petition in intervention shall be required, unless the party served with summons desires to offset benefits or to ask other affirmative relief, and no default judgment shall be taken for failure to answer any petition or petition in intervention, but the petitioners or petitioners in intervention shall be required to establish the facts alleged by competent evidence. Upon the issues being made up, or upon the lapse of time within which the parties served are required to appear by any summons, the court shall impanel a jury to hear and determine the matters in issue, and the jury shall determine and assess the benefits, if any, which the respective tracts of land are receiving or will receive from the maintenance of the drain or drains to be maintained, taking into consideration any and all matters relating to the benefits, if any, received or to be received from any drain, structure or improvement, and to credit or charge, as the case may be, to each tract so situated as to affect any other tract or tracts, or having improvement or structures thereon or easements granted in connection therewith, affecting any other tract or tracts included in such proceedings, and shall specify in their verdict the respective amount of benefits per acre, if any, assessed to each particular tract of land, by legal subdivisions.

Every person or corporation feeling himself or herself or itself aggrieved by any such judgment may appeal to the supreme court or the court of appeals within thirty days after the entry thereof, and such appeal shall bring before the supreme court or the court of appeals the propriety and justness of the verdicts of the jury in respect to the parties to the appeal. No bonds shall be required on such appeals. Nothing in this section contained shall be construed as affecting the right of drainage districts to consolidation in any manner provided by law.
