## 85.24.070 - Board of commissioners—Oath, bond—Plan of improvement—Levy of assessment, procedure.
A three-member board of commissioners shall be the governing body of an intercounty diking and drainage district. The initial commissioners shall be appointed, and the elected commissioners elected, as provided in chapter 85.38 RCW.

The members of such board, before entering upon their duties, shall take and subscribe on oath substantially as follows:

I, the undersigned, a member of the board of commissioners of the diking and drainage district No. . . . ., in . . . . . . and . . . . . . counties, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully discharge my duties as a member of the commission.

Upon the taking of such oath and the entering into a bond, as provided in RCW 85.38.080, the county legislative authority shall enter an order upon its records that the three persons named have qualified as the board of commissioners for diking and drainage district No. . . . ., in . . . . . . and . . . . . . counties, and that those persons and their successors do and shall constitute a board of commissioners for the diking and drainage district. The order when made shall be conclusive of the regularity of the election and qualification of the board of diking and drainage commissioners for the particular district, and the persons named therein shall constitute the board of diking and drainage commissioners.

The board of diking and drainage commissioners shall thereupon immediately organize and elect one of their number as chair and may either appoint a voter of the district or another diking and drainage commissioner to act as secretary. The board shall then proceed to make and cause to be made specifications and details of a system which may be adopted by the board for the improvements to be made, together with an estimate of the total cost thereof; and shall, upon the adoption of the plan of improvement of the district, proceed to acquire the necessary property and property rights for the construction, establishment, and maintenance of the system either by purchase or by power of eminent domain as hereinafter provided. Upon such acquisition being had, the board shall then proceed with the construction of the diking and drainage system and in doing so shall have the power to do the work directly or in its discretion to have all or any part of the work done by contract. In case the board shall decide upon doing the same by contract, it shall advertise for bids for the construction work, or such part thereof as they may determine to have done by contract, and shall have the authority to let a contract to the lowest responsible bidder after advertising for bids.

Any contractor doing work hereunder shall be required to furnish a bond as provided by the laws of the state of Washington relating to contractors of public work.

The board shall have the right, power, and authority to issue vouchers or warrants in payment or evidence of payment of any and all expenses incurred under this chapter, and shall have the power to issue the same to any contractor as the work progresses, the same to be based upon the partial estimates furnished from time to time by engineers of the district. All warrants issued hereunder shall draw interest at a rate determined by the board.

Upon the completion of the construction of the system, and ascertainment of the total cost thereof including all compensation and damages and costs and expenses incident to the acquiring of the necessary property and property right, the board shall then proceed to levy an assessment upon the taxable real property within the district which the board may find to be specially benefited by the proposed improvements; and shall make and levy such assessment upon each piece, lot, parcel, and separate tract of real estate in proportion to the particular and special benefits thereto. Upon determining the amount of the assessment against each particular tract of real estate as aforesaid, the commissioners shall make or cause to be made an assessment roll, in which shall appear the names of the owners of the property assessed, so far as known, and a general description of each lot, block, parcel, or tract of land within the district, and the amount assessed against the same, as separate, special, or particular benefits. The board shall thereupon make an order setting and fixing a day for hearing any objections to the assessment roll by any one affected thereby, which day shall be at least twenty days after the mailing of notices thereof, postage prepaid, as herein provided. The board shall send or cause to be sent by mail to each owner of the premises assessed, whose name and place of residence is known, a notice, substantially in the following form:

To . . . . . .: Your property (here describe the property) is assessed $ . . . . . A hearing on the assessment roll will be had before the undersigned at the office of the board at . . . . . . on the . . . . day of . . . . . . at which time you are notified to be and appear and to make any and all objections which you may have as to the amount of the assessment against your property, or as to whether it should be assessed at all; and to make any and all objections which you may have to the assessment against your lands, or any part or portion thereof.

The failure to send or cause to be sent such notice shall not be fatal to the proceedings herein described. The secretary of the board on the mailing of the notices shall certify generally that he or she has mailed such notices to the known address of all owners, and such certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the mailing of all such notices at the date mentioned in the certificate.

The board shall cause at least ten days' notice of the hearing to be given by posting notice in at least ten public places within the boundaries of the district, and by publishing the same at least five successive times in a daily newspaper published in each of the counties affected; and for at least two successive weeks in one or more weekly newspapers within the boundaries of the district, in each county if there are such newspapers published therein, and if there is no such newspaper published, then in one or more weekly newspapers, having a circulation in the district, for two successive weeks. The notice shall be signed by the chair or secretary of the board of commissioners, and shall state the date and place of hearing of objections to the assessment roll and levy, and of all other objections; and that all interested parties will be heard as to any objection to the assessment roll and the levies as therein made.

## 85.24.080 - Board of commissioners—Compensation and expenses.
The members of the board may receive as compensation up to ninety dollars per day or portion thereof spent in actual attendance at official meetings of the district, or in performance of other official services or duties on behalf of the district: PROVIDED, That such compensation shall not exceed eight thousand six hundred forty dollars in one calendar year: PROVIDED FURTHER, That the board may fix a different salary for the secretary thereof in lieu of the per diem. Each commissioner is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with such business, including subsistence and lodging, while away from the commissioner's place of residence, and mileage for use of a privately owned vehicle in accordance with chapter 42.24 RCW.

Any commissioner may waive all or any portion of his or her compensation payable under this section as to any month or months during his or her term of office, by a written waiver filed with the secretary as provided in this section. The waiver, to be effective, must be filed any time after the commissioner's election and prior to the date on which the compensation would otherwise be paid.

A person holding office as commissioner for two or more special purpose districts shall receive only that per diem compensation authorized for one of his or her commissioner positions as compensation for attending an official meeting or conducting official services or duties while representing more than one of his or her districts. However, such commissioner may receive additional per diem compensation if approved by resolution of all boards of the affected commissions.

## 85.24.130 - Objections to assessment—Procedure.
Any person interested in any real estate affected by said assessment may, within the time fixed, appear and file objections. As to all parcels, lots, or blocks as to which no objections are filed, within the time as aforesaid, the assessment thereon shall be confirmed and shall be final. On the hearing, each person may offer proof, and proof may also be offered on behalf of the assessment, and the board shall affirm, modify, change, and determine the assessment, in such sum as to the board appears just and right. The commissioners may increase the assessment during such hearing upon any particular tract by mailing notice to the owner at his or her last known address, to be and appear within a time not less than ten days after the date of the notice, to show cause why his or her assessment should not be increased. When the assessment is finally equalized and fixed by the board, the secretary thereof shall certify the same to the county treasurer of each county in which the lands are situated, for collection; or if appeal has been taken from any part thereof, then so much thereof as has not been appealed from shall be certified. In case any owner of property appeals to the superior court in relation to the assessment or other matter when the amount of the assessment is determined by the court finally, either upon determination of the superior court, or review by the supreme court or the court of appeals, then the assessment as finally fixed and determined by the court shall be certified by the clerk of the proper court to the county treasurer of the county in which the lands are situated and shall be spread upon and become a part of the assessment roll hereinbefore referred to.

## 85.24.140 - Judicial review.
Any person who feels aggrieved by the final assessment made against any lot, block, or parcel of land owned by him or her, may appeal therefrom to the superior court of the county in which the land is situated. Such appeal shall be taken within the time and substantially in the manner prescribed by the laws of this state for appeals from justices' courts. All notice of appeal shall be filed with the said board, and shall be served upon the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the action is brought. The secretary of the board shall, at appellant's expense, certify to the superior court so much of the record as appellant may request, and the cause shall be tried in the superior court de novo.

Any person aggrieved by any final order or judgment made by the superior court concerning any assessment authorized by this chapter, may seek appellate review of the order or judgment as in other civil cases.

## 85.24.150 - Lien of assessments—Notice and collection.
The final assessment shall be a lien paramount to all other liens except liens for taxes and other special assessments upon the property assessed, from the time the assessment roll shall have been finally approved by the board, and placed in the hands of the county treasurers as collectors. After the roll shall have been delivered to the county treasurers for collection, each treasurer shall proceed to collect the amounts due in the manner that other taxes are collected as to all lands situated within the county of which he or she is treasurer. The treasurer shall give at least ten days' notice in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the counties in which the lands are situated for two successive weeks, that the roll has been certified to him or her for collection, and that unless payment be made within thirty days from the date of the notice, that the sum charged against each lot or parcel of land shall be paid in not more than ten equal annual payments, with interest upon the whole sum so charged, at a rate not to exceed seven percent per annum. The interest shall be paid annually. The county treasurer shall proceed to collect the amount due each year upon the publication of notice as hereinafter provided.
