## 1.50.005 - Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that persons who donate organs help save the lives and promote the well-being of others in a manner that demonstrates the noblest side of human nature. Many families and friends of both the donors and the donees may want to remember the special act of donation in a way that honors the memory of the donor and encourages donation by others in the future.

To recognize the special kindness of those who donate their organs, the legislature establishes the Washington gift of life award.

## 1.50.006 - Findings—Intent.
1. The legislature finds that eighty-four people died waiting for an organ transplant in Washington state in 2013. The legislature further finds that more than two thousand six hundred people are currently waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant in Washington state. Forty of those patients waiting are under the age of eighteen and more than two hundred of those patients have been waiting for more than five years for their lifesaving gift. The legislature further finds that organ donation is a very rare and precious gift. Less than one percent of all people who die are eligible to donate their organs due to the unique circumstances needed at death to donate organs. Every donor is a critical donation to those waiting.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to update the gift of life award to recognize all Washington citizens who have donated critical lifesaving organs.
