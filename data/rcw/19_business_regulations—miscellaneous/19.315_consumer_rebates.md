## 19.315.010 - Definitions.
As used in this chapter:

1. "Person" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.86.010.

2. "Rebate" means an offer to provide cash, credit, or credit towards future purchases, that is offered to consumers who acquire or purchase a specified product or service and that is conditioned upon the customer submitting a request for redemption after satisfying the terms and conditions of the offer. "Rebate" does not include: Any discount from the purchase price that is taken at the time of purchase; any discount, cash, credit, or credit towards a future purchase that is automatically provided to a consumer without the need to submit a request for redemption; or any refund that may be given to a consumer in accordance with a company's return, guarantee, adjustment, or warranty policies, or any company's frequent shopper customer reward program.

2. Upon receipt of a request for redemption meeting the terms and conditions of the rebate offer, the person offering the rebate shall transmit the rebate funds to the consumer within ninety days.

3. If a rebate is sent to a consumer as a check, the check must be mailed in a manner that identifies the piece of mail as the expected rebate check.

4. This section applies only to the person offering the rebate, which is the person who provides the cash, credit, or credit towards future purchases to the consumer. This section does not apply to a person who processes a rebate or who provides consumers with instructions or materials related to a rebate.
