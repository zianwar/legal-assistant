## 19.27A.130 - Finding—2009 c 423.
The legislature finds that energy efficiency is the cheapest, quickest, and cleanest way to meet rising energy needs, confront climate change, and boost our economy. More than thirty percent of Washington's greenhouse gas emissions come from energy use in buildings. Making homes, businesses, and public institutions more energy efficient will save money, create good local jobs, enhance energy security, reduce pollution that causes global warming, and speed economic recovery while reducing the need to invest in costly new generation. Washington can spur its economy and assert its regional and national clean energy leadership by putting efficiency first. Washington can accomplish this by: Promoting super efficient, low-energy use building codes; requiring disclosure of buildings' energy use to prospective buyers; making public buildings models of energy efficiency; financing energy saving upgrades to existing buildings; and reducing utility bills for low-income households.

3. The strategic plan must include recommendations to the council on energy code upgrades. At a minimum, the strategic plan must: 

   a. Consider development of aspirational codes separate from the state energy code that contain economically and technically feasible optional standards that could achieve higher energy efficiency for those builders that elected to follow the aspirational codes in lieu of or in addition to complying with the standards set forth in the state energy code;

   b. Determine the appropriate methodology to measure achievement of state energy code targets using the United States environmental protection agency's target finder program or equivalent methodology;

   c. Address the need for enhanced code training and enforcement;

   d. Include state strategies to support research, demonstration, and education programs designed to achieve a seventy percent reduction in annual net energy consumption as specified in RCW 19.27A.160 and enhance energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy production in buildings; 

   e. Recommend incentives, education, training programs and certifications, particularly state-approved training or certification programs, joint apprenticeship programs, or labor-management partnership programs that train workers for energy-efficiency projects to ensure proposed programs are designed to increase building professionals' ability to design, construct, and operate buildings that will meet the seventy percent reduction in annual net energy consumption as specified in RCW 19.27A.160;

   f. Address barriers for utilities to serve net zero energy homes and buildings and policies to overcome those barriers;

   g. Address the limits of a prescriptive code in achieving net zero energy use homes and buildings and propose a transition to performance-based codes;

   h. Identify financial mechanisms such as tax incentives, rebates, and innovative financing to motivate energy consumers to take action to increase energy efficiency and their use of on-site renewable energy. Such incentives, rebates, or financing options may consider the role of government programs as well as utility-sponsored programs;

   i. Address the adequacy of education and technical assistance, including school curricula, technical training, and peer-to-peer exchanges for professional and trade audiences;

   j. Develop strategies to develop and install district and neighborhood-wide energy systems that help meet net zero energy use in homes and buildings;

   k. Identify costs and benefits of energy efficiency measures on residential and nonresidential construction; and

   l. Investigate methodologies and standards for the measurement of the amount of embodied energy used in building materials.
