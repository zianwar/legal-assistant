## 19.94.015 - Commercial use of instrument or device—Registration—Fees.
1. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section for the initial registration of an instrument or device, no weighing or measuring instrument or device may be used for commercial purposes in the state unless its commercial use is registered annually. If its commercial use is within a city that has a city sealer and a weights and measures program as provided by RCW 19.94.280, the commercial use of the instrument or device must be registered with the city if the city has adopted fees pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. If its commercial use is outside of such a city, the commercial use of the instrument or device must be registered with the department.

2. A city with such a sealer and program may establish an annual fee for registering the commercial use of such a weighing or measuring instrument or device with the city. The annual fee may not exceed the fee established in RCW 19.94.175 for registering the use of a similar instrument or device with the department. Fees upon weighing or measuring instruments or devices within the jurisdiction of the city that are collected under this subsection by city sealers must be deposited into the general fund, or other account, of the city as directed by the governing body of the city.

3. Registrations with the department are accomplished as part of the business licensing system under chapter 19.02 RCW. Payment of the registration fee for a weighing or measuring instrument or device under the business licensing system constitutes the registration required by this section.

4. The fees established by or under RCW 19.94.175 for registering a weighing or measuring instrument or device must be paid to the department of revenue concurrently with an application for a business license under chapter 19.02 RCW or with the annual renewal of a business license under chapter 19.02 RCW. A weighing or measuring instrument or device must be initially registered with the state at the time the owner applies for a business license for a new business or at the first renewal of the license that occurs after the instrument or device is first placed into commercial use. The department of revenue must remit to the department of agriculture all fees collected under this provision less reasonable collection expenses.

5. Each city charging registration fees under this section must notify the department of agriculture at the time such fees are adopted and whenever changes in the fees are adopted.

## 19.94.150 - Standards recognized.
The system of weights and measures in customary use in the United States and the metric system of weights and measures are jointly recognized, and either one or both of these systems shall be used for all commercial purposes in this state. The definitions of basic units of weight and measure and weights and measures equivalents, as published by the national institute of standards and technology or any successor organization, are recognized and shall govern weighing or measuring instruments or devices used in commercial activities and other transactions involving weights and measures within this state.

\[ [1992 c 237 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6483-S.SL.pdf?cite=1992%20c%20237%20§%204); [1991 sp.s. c 23 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1856-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20sp.s.%20c%2023%20§%204); [1969 c 67 § 15](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969c67.pdf?cite=1969%20c%2067%20§%2015); \]

## 19.94.160 - State standards.
Physical weights and measures standards that conform to the standards of the United States obtained by the state for use as state weights and measures standards are the primary standards for weight and measure, when certified as such by the national institute of standards and technology or any successor organization. The state weights and measures standards shall be kept in a place designated by the director and shall be maintained in such calibration as prescribed by the national institute of standards and technology or any successor organization.

2. Pursuant to RCW 19.94.015, a reasonable registration fee for electric vehicle supply equipment, in addition to the fees established in subsection (1) of this section, may be established through rule making to cover the remaining costs associated with enforcing this chapter on electric vehicle supply equipment. The department may consider differential fees to reduce the potential burden of the registration fee for electric vehicle service providers operating less than 25 publicly available electric vehicle supply equipment in Washington.

3. With the exception of subsection (4) of this section, no person shall be required to pay more than the annual registration fee for any weighing or measuring instrument or device in any one year.

4. The department or a city sealer may establish reasonable inspection and testing fees for each type or class of weighing or measuring instrument or device specially requested to be inspected or tested by the device owner. These inspection and testing fees shall be limited to those amounts necessary for the department or city sealer to cover the direct costs associated with such inspection and testing. The fees shall not be set so as to compete with service agents normally engaged in such services.

5. The weights and measures advisory group within the department must review the fees in subsection (1) of this section and report to stakeholders on the financial status of the program supported by the fees by September 1, 2024, and September 1st every five years thereafter.
