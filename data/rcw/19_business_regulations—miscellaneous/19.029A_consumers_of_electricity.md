3. The utility must:

   a. Obtain a retail electric customer's prior permission for each instance of disclosure of his or her private or proprietary customer information to an affiliate, subsidiary, or other third party for purposes of marketing services or products that the customer does not already subscribe to; and

   b. Maintain a record for each instance of permission for disclosing a retail electric customer's private or proprietary customer information.

   a. The confirmation of consent for the disclosure of private customer information;

   b. A list of the date of the consent and the affiliates, subsidiaries, or third parties to which the customer has authorized disclosure of his or her private or proprietary customer information; and

   c. A confirmation that the name, service address, and account number exactly matches the utility record for such account.

5. [Empty]

   a. This section does not require customer permission for or prevent disclosure of private or proprietary customer information by an electric utility to a third party with which the utility has a contract where such contract is directly related to conduct of the utility's business, provided that the contract prohibits the third party from further disclosing or selling any private or proprietary customer information obtained from the utility to a party that is not the utility and not a party to the contract with the utility.

   b. The legislature finds that the disclosure or sale of private or proprietary customer information by a third party, when prohibited by a contract under this subsection (5), is a matter vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW, to the third party. Disclosure or sale of private or proprietary customer information by a third party, when prohibited by a contract under this subsection (5), is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

6. This section does not prevent disclosure of the essential terms and conditions of special contracts.

7. This section does not prevent the electric utility from inserting any marketing information into the retail electric customer's billing package.

9. The statewide minimum privacy policy established in subsections (1) through (8) of this section must, in the case of an investor-owned utility, be enforced by the commission by rule or order.

10. The statewide minimum privacy policy established in subsections (1) through (8) of this section must, in the case of a consumer-owned utility, be implemented by the utility through a policy adopted by the governing board within one year of October 9, 2015, that includes provisions ensuring compliance with subsections (1) through (8) of this section. The policy must include procedures, consistent with applicable law, for investigation and resolution of complaints by a retail electric customer whose private or proprietary information may have been sold by the consumer-owned utility or disclosed by the utility for the purposes of marketing services or product offerings in violation of this section.

## 19.29A.110 - Persons—Customer information—Capture, obtain, or disclosure for commercial purpose—Requirements—Application of consumer protection act.
1. A person may not capture or obtain private or proprietary customer information for a commercial purpose unless the person:

   a. Informs the retail electric customer before capturing or obtaining private or proprietary customer information; and

   b. Receives the retail electric customer's written or electronic permission to capture or obtain private or proprietary customer information.

2. A person who legally possesses private or proprietary customer information that is captured or obtained for a commercial purpose may not sell, lease, or otherwise disclose the private or proprietary customer information to another person unless:

   a. The retail electric customer consents to the disclosure;

   b. The private or proprietary customer information is disclosed to an electric utility or other third party as necessary to effect, administer, enforce, or complete a financial transaction that the retail electric customer requested, initiated, or authorized, provided that the electric utility or third party maintains confidentiality of the private or proprietary customer information and does not further disclose the information except as permitted under this subsection (2); or

   c. The disclosure is required or expressly permitted by a federal statute or by a state statute.

3. For the purposes of this section, "person" means any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other organization or commercial entity, except that "person" does not include an electric utility.

4. Except as provided in RCW 19.29A.120, the legislature finds that the practices covered by this section are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this section is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

\[ [2015 c 285 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1896-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20285%20§%204); \]

## 19.29A.120 - Exemptions—Energy benchmark programs.
This chapter does not apply to energy benchmarking programs authorized by: (1) Federal law; (2) state law; or (3) local laws that are consistent with the personally identifying information requirements of RCW 19.27A.170.

\[ [2015 c 285 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1896-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20285%20§%205); \]

## 19.29A.130 - Finding—Intent.
1. Consumer disclosure ensures that retail electric consumers purchasing electric energy receive basic information about the characteristics associated with their electric product in a form that facilitates consumer understanding of retail electric energy service and the development of new products responsive to consumer preferences.

2. The legislature finds and declares that there is a need for reliable, accurate, and timely information regarding fuel source that is consistently collected, for all electricity products offered for retail sale in Washington.

3. The desirability and feasibility of such disclosure has been clearly established in nutrition labeling, uniform food pricing, truth-in-lending, and other consumer information programs.

4. The legislature intends to establish a consumer disclosure standard under which retail suppliers in Washington disclose information on the fuel mix of the electricity products they sell. Fundamental to disclosure is a label that promotes consistency in content and format, that is accurate, reliable, and simple to understand, and that allows verification of the accuracy of information reported.

5. To ensure that consumer information is verifiable and accurate, certain characteristics of electricity generation must be tracked and compared with information provided to consumers.

6. The legislature recognizes that the generation, transmission, and delivery of electricity occurs through a complex network of interconnected facilities and contractual arrangements. As a result, the legislature intends that the fuel characteristics disclosed under this chapter represent reasonable approximations that are suitable only for informational or disclosure purposes.

7. The disclosures required by this chapter reflect the characteristics of electricity products offered by retail suppliers to customers. Nothing in this chapter prohibits a retail supplier from communicating to its customers, owners, taxpayers, or the general public information regarding its investment in or ownership of renewable or nonrenewable generating facilities, its production of electricity, or its wholesale market activities, as long as the information is provided separately from the electricity product content label.

## 19.29A.140 - Sources and uses of electricity—Report to department.
1. Each retail supplier must report to the department each year, based on actual and verified activity in the prior year, the following information on its sources and uses of electricity in Washington:

   a. Electricity delivered to retail electric customers;

   b. Purchases or receipts of electricity from declared resources used to serve retail electric customers, by generating facility and fuel type; and

   c. Purchases or receipts of electricity from unspecified sources used to serve retail electric customers.

2.The following requirements and limitations apply to the reporting of declared resources:

   a. A retail supplier must report an electricity purchase or receipt as a declared resource if the retail supplier was the direct or indirect owner of the generating facility or acquired the electricity in a transaction, supported by an auditable contract trail, in which the buyer and seller specified the source or set of sources of the electricity.

   b. A retail supplier may assign declared resources and unspecified resources to its retail service for purposes of this section using reasonable methods consistent with its business practices. A retail supplier must identify any change in method from the prior year in its report to the department.

   c. A retail supplier may not report a declared resource as a renewable resource if there exists a renewable energy certificate or other instrument representing the nonpower attributes of the electricity and the retail supplier does not own the renewable energy certificate or instrument.

   d. For an electricity product that is an optional product complying with RCW 19.29A.090, a retail supplier may report as a declared resource any combination of renewable energy certificates and electricity that meets the requirements of RCW 19.29A.090.

3. Each retail supplier must report as an unspecified source any electricity source that was acquired in a transaction where the fuel attribute was not specified by the seller or provider or was not included in the transaction.

4. A retail supplier that offers more than one electricity product must report the required source information separately for each product. Individual retail customer rate schedules do not constitute separate electricity products unless electricity sources are different.

5. Each retail supplier must report the information required by this section as annual totals in megawatt-hours.

6. The department must determine fuel mix percentages for each retail supplier based on the information provided in source and disposition reports. Each retail supplier's fuel mix percentages must reflect, to the extent possible, the declared resources reported by that retail supplier.

\[ [2019 c 222 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1428-S.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20222%20§%205); \]

## 19.29A.150 - Renewable energy certificates.
1. Any renewable energy certificate included in the source and disposition report must be created and retired within the certificate tracking system approved by the department and must represent renewable generation of a generating facility located in the region of the tracking system.

2. A renewable energy certificate retired for any of the following purposes may not be included in the source and disposition report:

   a. Voluntary renewable energy programs, except where the electricity product is an optional product complying with RCW 19.29A.090;

   b. Compliance obligations not related to the provision of electricity service to retail customers in Washington; and

   c. Any other purpose established by rule by the department.

3. A retail supplier must retire any renewable energy certificates included in its source and disposition report within one year after submitting its report.

\[ [2019 c 222 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1428-S.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20222%20§%206); \]

## 19.29A.160 - Department—Fuel characteristics estimate.
The department must develop and publish an estimate of the fuel characteristics of the generation sources reasonably available to serve Washington customers and not included as a declared resource of any retail supplier. The department may include or exclude any electricity source as it deems reasonable to accurately represent the characteristics of residual electricity supplies used by retail suppliers in Washington. The department must make available documentation of the inputs and calculations used in making the estimate.

\[ [2019 c 222 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1428-S.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20222%20§%207); \]

## 19.29A.900 - Construction—1998 c 300.
Nothing in chapter 300, Laws of 1998 shall be construed as conferring on any state agency jurisdiction, supervision, or control over any consumer-owned utility.

\[ [1998 c 300 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6560-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20300%20§%207); \]
