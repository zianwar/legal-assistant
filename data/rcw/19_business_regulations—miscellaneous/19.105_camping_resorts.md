## 19.105.336 - Availability of campgrounds to contract purchasers—Blanket encumbrances—Penalty for noncompliance.
1. With respect to every campground located within the state which was not made available to purchasers of camping resort contracts prior to June 20, 1988, and with respect to any new blanket encumbrance placed against any campground in this state or any prior blanket encumbrance against any campground in this state with respect to which the underlying obligation is refinanced after June 20, 1988, the camping resort operator shall not represent any such campground to be available to purchasers of its camping resort contracts until one of the following events has occurred with regard to each such blanket encumbrance:

   a. The camping resort operator obtains and records as covenants to run with the land a nondisturbance agreement from each holder of the blanket encumbrance. The nondisturbance agreement shall be executed by the camping resort operator and by each holder of the blanket encumbrance and shall include the provisions set forth in RCW 19.105.300(18) and the following:

      i. The instrument may be enforced by individual purchasers of camping resort contracts. If the camping resort operator is not in default under its obligations to the holder of the blanket encumbrance, the agreement may be enforced by the camping resort operator.

      ii. The agreement shall be effective as between each purchaser and the holder of the blanket encumbrance despite any rejection or cancellation of the purchaser's contract during any bankruptcy proceedings of the camping resort operator.

      iii. The agreement shall be binding upon the successors in interest of both the camping resort operator and the holder of the blanket encumbrance.

      iv. A holder of the blanket encumbrance who obtains title or possession or who causes a change in title or possession in a campground by foreclosure or otherwise and who does not continue to operate the campground upon conditions no less favorable to members than existed prior to the change of title or possession shall either:

          A.  Offer the title or possession to an association of members to operate the campground; or

          B.  Obtain a commitment from another entity which obtains title or possession to undertake the responsibility of operating the campground.

   b. The camping resort operator posts a bond or irrevocable letter of credit with the director in a form satisfactory to the director in the amount of the aggregate principal indebtedness remaining due under the blanket encumbrance.

   c. The camping resort operator delivers an encumbrance trust agreement in a form satisfactory to the director, as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

   d. The camping resort operator delivers other financial assurances reasonably acceptable to the director.

2. With respect to any campground located within the state other than a campground described in subsection (1) of this section, the camping resort operator shall not represent the campground to be available to purchasers of camping resort contracts after June 20, 1988, until one of the following events has occurred with regard to each blanket encumbrance:

   a. The camping resort operator obtains and records a nondisturbance agreement to run with the land pursuant to subsection (1) of this section from each holder of the blanket encumbrance.

   b. The camping resort operator posts a surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit with the director in a form satisfactory to the director in the amount of the aggregate principal indebtedness remaining due under the blanket encumbrance.

   c. The camping resort operator delivers to the director, in a form satisfactory to the director, an encumbrance trust agreement among the camping resort operator, a trustee (which can be either a corporate trustee licensed to act as a trustee under Washington law, licensed escrow agent, or a licensed attorney), and the director.

   d. The camping resort operator delivers evidence to the director that any financial institution that has made a hypothecation loan to the camping resort operator (the "hypothecation lender") shall have a lien on, or security interest in, the camping resort operator's interest in the campground, and the hypothecation lender shall have executed and recorded a nondisturbance agreement in the real estate records of the county in which the campground is located. Each person holding an interest in a blanket encumbrance superior to the interest held by the hypothecation lender shall have executed and recorded an instrument stating that such person shall give the hypothecation lender notice of, and at least thirty days to cure, any default under the blanket encumbrance before the person commences any foreclosure action affecting the campground. For the purposes of this subsection, a hypothecation loan to a camping resort operator is a loan or line of credit secured by the camping resort contracts receivable arising from the sale of camping resort contracts by the camping resort operator, which exceeds in the aggregate all outstanding indebtedness secured by blanket encumbrances superior to the interest held by the hypothecation lender.

   e. The camping resort operator delivers other financial assurances reasonably acceptable to the director.

3. Any camping resort operator which does not comply at all times with subsection (1) or (2) of this section with regard to any blanket encumbrance in connection with any applicable campground is prohibited from offering any camping resort contracts for sale in Washington during the period of noncompliance.

\[ [1988 c 159 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c159.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20159%20§%207); \]

## 19.105.340 - Impounding proceeds from contract sales—Conditional release of impounded funds—Funds not subject to lien—No assignment of impounded or reserved assets.
1. If the director finds that the applicant or registrant has not by other means assured future availability to and quiet enjoyment of the campgrounds and facilities, as required under this chapter, the director may, notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 19.105.336, require impoundment of the funds or membership receivables, or both, from camping resort contract sales, including the impoundment of periodic dues or assessments required of purchasers under the contracts, or provide other assurances acceptable to the director, until sufficient funds have been impounded or arrangements made to alleviate the inadequacy. The director may, upon finding it reasonable and necessary, for compliance with RCW 19.105.336 and 19.105.365, and not inconsistent with the protection of purchasers or owners of camping resort contracts, provide for release to the applicant, registrant, or others of all or a portion of the impounded funds, membership receivables, or other assets in the impound. The director may take appropriate measures to assure that the impounded funds will be applied as required by this chapter.

2. Funds placed in impounds under this section or reserve accounts under RCW 19.105.350 are not subject to lien, attachment, or the possession of lenders or creditors of the operator, trustees in bankruptcy, receivers, or other third parties. In instances of bankruptcy, foreclosure, attachment, or other contingency where the ownership or beneficiary status of funds in depositories, or the receivables and funds to be collected from receivables, may be at issue, the purchasers of contracts under this chapter, as a class, shall be deemed the beneficiary. No individual purchaser or group of purchasers, other than the purchasers as a class, have any right to possession, attachment, lien, or right of partition of funds or receivables in the impound or reserve.

3. It is unlawful for an operator or other person to assign, hypothecate, sell, or pledge any contract or other asset placed into an impound or reserve under this chapter without the express written approval of the director or a court of competent jurisdiction.

\[ [1988 c 159 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c159.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20159%20§%208); [1982 c 69 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982c69.pdf?cite=1982%20c%2069%20§%205); \]

## 19.105.345 - Persons licensed under chapter  18.85 RCW exempt from salesperson registration requirements.
Persons licensed under chapter 18.85 RCW are exempt from the camping resort salesperson registration requirements of this chapter for camping resort contracts offered through the licensed brokerage.

\[ [1988 c 159 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c159.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20159%20§%209); \]

## 19.105.350 - Director may require reserve fund by order—Actions against a registration.
1. If the purchaser will own or acquire title to specified real property or improvements to be acquired by the camping resort, the director may by order require to the extent necessary to protect the interests of the purchasers or owners of camping resort contracts, that an appropriate portion of the proceeds paid under those camping resort contracts be placed in a separate reserve fund to be set aside and applied toward the purchase price of the real property, improvements, or facilities.

2. The director may take any of the actions authorized in RCW 18.235.110 against a registration in which the registrant is advertising or offering annual or periodic dues or assessments by members that the director finds would result in the registrant's future inability to fund operating costs.

## 19.105.390 - Resort contracts—Purchaser's cancellation—Notice—Statement of right to cancel.
Any camping resort contract may be canceled at the option of the purchaser, if the purchaser sends notice of the cancellation by certified mail (return receipt requested) to the camping resort operator at the address contained in the camping resort contract and if the notice is postmarked not later than midnight of the third business day following the day on which the contract is signed. In addition to this cancellation right, any purchaser who signs a camping resort contract of any description required to be registered with the department without having received the written disclosures required by this chapter has cancellation rights until three business days following eventual receipt of the written disclosures. Purchasers shall request cancellation of contracts by sending the notice of cancellation by certified mail (return receipt requested), postmarked not later than midnight of the third business day following the day on which the contract is signed or the day on which the disclosures were actually received, whichever event is later to the camping resort operator at the address contained in the camping resort contract. In computing the number of business days, the day on which the contract was signed shall not be included as a "business day," nor shall Saturday, Sunday, or legal holidays be included. Within three business days following receipt of timely and proper notice of cancellation from the purchaser, the camping resort operator shall provide evidence that the contract has been canceled. Thereafter, any money or other consideration paid by the purchaser shall be promptly refunded.

Every camping resort contract, other than those being offered and registered as resales, shall include the following statement in at least ten-point bold-face type immediately prior to the space for the purchaser's signature:

"Purchaser's right to cancel: You may cancel this contract without any cancellation fee or other penalty, or stated reason for doing so, by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to . . . . . . (insert name and address of camping resort operator). The notice must be postmarked by midnight of the third business day following the day on which the contract is signed. In computing the three business days, the day on which the contract is signed shall not be included as a "business day," nor shall Saturday, Sunday, or legal holidays be included."

If the purchaser has not inspected a camping resort property or facility at which camping resort sites are located or planned, the notice must contain the following additional language:

"If you sign this contract without having inspected a property at which camping sites are located or planned, you may cancel this contract by giving this notice within six (6) business days following the day on which you signed the contract."

\[ [1988 c 159 § 16](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c159.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20159%20§%2016); [1982 c 69 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982c69.pdf?cite=1982%20c%2069%20§%2011); \]

## 19.105.405 - Purchaser lists—Authorized uses.
1. The legislature recognizes the proprietary interest camping resort operators have in purchaser lists. The legislature also recognizes that purchasers of camping resort contracts have a legitimate interest in being able to contact other resort purchasers for the purpose of forming a members' association. In balancing these competing interests, the legislature believes that purchaser lists can be made available to camping resort purchasers with reasonable restrictions on the dissemination of those lists.

2. Upon request of a purchaser, the camping resort operator shall provide to the purchaser a list of the names, addresses, and unit, site, or purchaser number of all purchasers. The camping resort operator may charge for the reasonable costs for preparing the list. The operator shall require the purchaser to sign an affidavit agreeing not to use the list for any commercial purpose.

3. It is a violation of this chapter and chapter 19.86 RCW for any person to use a membership list for commercial purposes unless authorized to do so by the operator.

4. It is a violation of this chapter and chapter 19.86 RCW for a camping resort operator to fail to provide a list of purchasers as provided in this section.

\[ [1988 c 159 § 17](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c159.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20159%20§%2017); \]

## 19.105.411 - Fees.

1. A fee for the initial application and an additional fee for each camping resort contract registered;

2. Renewals of camping resort registrations and an additional fee for each additional camping resort contract registered;

4. The review and processing of advertising or promotional materials;

5. Registration and renewal of registrations of salespersons;

6. The transfer of a salesperson's permit from one operator to another;

8. Amending the registration or the public offering statement;

9. Conducting site inspections;

10. Granting exemptions under this chapter;

11. Penalties for registrants in any situation where a registrant has failed to file an amendment to the registration or the public offering statement in a timely manner for material changes, as required in this chapter and its implementing rules.

\[ [1988 c 159 § 18](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c159.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20159%20§%2018); \]

## 19.105.420 - Resort contracts—Registration, duration—Renewal, amendment—Renewal of prior permits.
A registration of camping resort contracts shall be effective for a period of one year and may, upon application, be renewed for successive periods of one year each, unless the director prescribes a shorter period for a permit or registration. A camping resort contract registration shall be amended if there is to be an increase in inventory or consolidation to the number of camping resort contracts registered, or in instances in which new contract forms are to be offered. Consolidations, new contract forms, the adding of resorts to the program, or amendments for material changes shall become effective in the manner provided by RCW 19.105.330. The written disclosures required to be furnished prospective purchasers under RCW 19.105.370 shall be supplemented by amendment request in writing as necessary to keep the required information reasonably current and reflective of material changes. Amendments shall be filed with the director as provided in RCW 19.105.360. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, the camping resort operator or registrant shall file an amendment to the registration disclosing any event which will have a material effect on the conduct of the operation of the camping resort, the financial condition of the camping resort, or the future availability of the camping resort properties to purchasers. The amendment shall be filed within thirty days following the event. The amendment shall be treated as an original application for registration, except that until the director has acted upon the application for amendment the applicant's registration shall continue to be deemed effective for the purposes of RCW 19.105.310.

Any permit to sell camping resort memberships issued prior to November 1, 1982, shall be deemed a camping resort registration subject to the renewal provisions of this chapter upon the anniversary date of the issuance of the original permit.

## 19.105.430 - Unlawful to act as salesperson without registering—Exemptions.
Unless the transaction is exempt under RCW 19.105.325, it is unlawful for any person to act as a camping resort salesperson in this state without first registering under this chapter as a salesperson or being licensed as a salesperson under chapter 18.85 RCW or a broker licensed under that chapter.

\[ [1988 c 159 § 20](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c159.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20159%20§%2020); [1982 c 69 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982c69.pdf?cite=1982%20c%2069%20§%2014); \]

   a. Violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any lawful rules adopted by the director pursuant thereto;

   b. Making, printing, publishing, distributing, or causing, authorizing, or knowingly permitting the making, printing, publication, or distribution of false statements, descriptions, or promises of such character as to reasonably induce any person to act thereon, if the statements, descriptions, or promises purport to be made or to be performed by either the applicant or registrant and the applicant or registrant then knew or, by the exercise of reasonable care and inquiry, could have known, of the falsity of the statements, descriptions, or promises;

   c. Knowingly committing, or being a party to, any material fraud, misrepresentation, concealment, conspiracy, collusion, trick, scheme, or device whereby any other person lawfully relies upon the work, representation, or conduct of the applicant or registrant;

   d. Continuing to sell camping resort contracts in a manner whereby the interests of the public are endangered, if the director has, by order in writing, stated objections thereto;

   e. Misrepresentation of membership in any state or national association; or

   f. Discrimination against any person in hiring or in sales activity on the basis of race, color, creed, or national origin, or violating any state or federal antidiscrimination law.

3. The director, subsequent to any complaint filed against a salesperson or pursuant to an investigation to determine violations, may enter into stipulated assurances of discontinuances in lieu of issuing a statement of charges or a cease and desist order or conducting a hearing. The assurance shall consist of a statement of the law in question and an agreement not to violate the stated provision. The salesperson shall not be required to admit to any violation of the law, nor shall the assurance be construed as such an admission. Violation of an assurance under this subsection is grounds for disciplinary action.

4. The director may by rule require such further information or conditions for registration as a camping resort salesperson, including qualifying examinations and fingerprint cards prepared by authorized law enforcement agencies, as the director deems necessary to protect the interests of purchasers.

5. Registration as a camping resort salesperson shall be effective for a period of one year unless the director specifies otherwise or the salesperson transfers employment to a different registrant. Registration as a camping resort salesperson shall be renewed annually, or at the time of transferring employment, whichever occurs first, by the filing of a form prescribed by the director for that purpose.

6. It is unlawful for a registrant of camping resort contracts to employ or a person to act as a camping resort salesperson covered under this section unless the salesperson has in effect with the department and displays a valid registration in a conspicuous location at each of the sales offices at which the salesperson is employed. It is the responsibility of both the operator and the salesperson to notify the department when and where a salesperson is employed, his or her responsibilities and duties, and when the salesperson's employment or reported duties are changed or terminated.

7. The director shall immediately suspend the license or certificate of a person who has been certified pursuant to RCW 74.20A.320 by the department of social and health services as a person who is not in compliance with a support order. If the person has continued to meet all other requirements for reinstatement during the suspension, reissuance of the license or certificate shall be automatic upon the director's receipt of a release issued by the department of social and health services stating that the licensee is in compliance with the order.

## 19.105.450 - Investigations—Scope—Publishing information.
The director may make such public or private investigations or may make such requests for information, within or without this state, as the director deems necessary to determine whether any registration should be granted, denied, suspended, or revoked, or a fine imposed, or whether any person has violated or is about to violate any of the provisions of this chapter or any rule, order, or permit under this chapter, or to aid in the enforcement of this chapter or in prescribing of rules and forms under, and amendments to, this chapter and may publish information concerning any violation of this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.

The procedures in RCW 18.235.150 apply to these cease and desist orders. However, the director may issue a temporary order pending the hearing which shall be effective immediately upon delivery to the person affected and which shall remain in effect until ten days after the hearing is held and which shall become final if the person to whom notice is addressed does not request a hearing.
