## 19.138.010 - Legislative finding and declaration.
The legislature finds and declares that advertising, sales, and business practices of certain sellers of travel have worked financial hardship upon the people of this state; that the travel business has a significant impact upon the economy and well-being of this state and its people; that problems have arisen regarding certain sales of travel; and that the public welfare requires registration of sellers of travel in order to eliminate unfair advertising, sales and business practices. The legislature further finds it necessary to establish standards that will safeguard the people against financial hardship and to encourage fair dealing and prosperity in the travel business.

That solicitation signifies the nonresident's agreement that process against the nonresident that is served as provided in this chapter is of the same legal force and validity as if served personally on the nonresident seller of travel.

2. Service of process upon a nonresident seller of travel shall be made by leaving a copy of the process with the director.

Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements, however, once service has been made on the director as provided in this section, in the event of failure to comply with the requirement of notice to the nonresident, the court may order that notice be given that will be sufficient to apprise the nonresident.
