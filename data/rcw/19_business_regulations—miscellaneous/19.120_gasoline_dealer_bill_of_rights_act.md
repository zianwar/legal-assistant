1. The parties shall deal with each other in good faith.

2. For the purposes of this chapter and without limiting its general application, it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition and therefore unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to:

   a. Require a motor fuel retailer to purchase or lease goods or services of the motor fuel refiner-supplier or from approved sources of supply unless and to the extent that the motor fuel refiner-supplier satisfies the burden of proving that such restrictive purchasing agreements are reasonably necessary for a lawful purpose justified on business grounds, and do not substantially affect competition: PROVIDED, That this provision shall not apply to the initial inventory of the motor fuel franchise. In determining whether a requirement to purchase or lease goods or services constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition the courts shall be guided by the decisions of the courts of the United States interpreting and applying the anti-trust laws of the United States.

   b. Discriminate between motor fuel retailers in the charges offered or made for royalties, goods, services, equipment, rentals, advertising services, or in any other business dealing, unless and to the extent that the motor fuel refiner-supplier satisfies the burden of proving that any classification of or discrimination between motor fuel retailers is reasonable, is based on motor fuel franchises granted at materially different times and such discrimination is reasonably related to such difference in time or on other proper and justifiable distinctions considering the purposes of this chapter, and is not arbitrary.

   c. Sell, rent, or offer to sell to a motor fuel retailer any product or service for more than a fair and reasonable price.

   d. Require a motor fuel retailer to assent to a release, assignment, novation, or waiver which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this chapter.

## 19.120.090 - Action for damages, rescission, or other relief.
1. Any person who sells or offers to sell a motor fuel franchise in violation of this chapter shall be liable to the motor fuel retailer or motor fuel refiner-supplier who may sue at law or in equity for damages caused thereby for rescission or other relief as the court may deem appropriate. In the case of a violation of RCW 19.120.070 rescission is not available to the plaintiff if the defendant proves that the plaintiff knew the facts concerning the untruth or omission or that the defendant exercised reasonable care and did not know or if he or she had exercised reasonable care would not have known of the untruth or omission.

2. The suit authorized under subsection (1) of this section may be brought to recover the actual damages sustained by the plaintiff: PROVIDED, That the prevailing party may in the discretion of the court recover the costs of said action including a reasonable attorneys' fee.

4. A final judgment, order, or decree heretofore or hereafter rendered against a person in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings under the United States anti-trust laws, under the federal trade commission act, or this chapter shall be regarded as evidence against such persons in any action brought by any party against such person under subsection (1) of this section as to all matters which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel between the parties thereto.

## 19.120.100 - Limitation period tolled.
The pendency of any civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings against a person brought by the federal or Washington state governments or any of their agencies under the anti-trust laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any federal or state act related to anti-trust laws or to franchising, or under this chapter shall toll the limitation of this action if the action is then instituted within one year after the final judgment or order in such proceedings: PROVIDED, That said limitation of actions shall in any case toll the law so long as there is actual concealment on the part of the person.

The prevailing party may in the discretion of the court recover the costs of such action including a reasonable attorneys' fee.

2. Nothing in this chapter limits the power of the state to punish any person for any conduct which constitutes a crime by statute or at common law.

\[ [1986 c 320 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c320.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20320%20§%2013); \]
