## 11.96A.120 - Application of doctrine of virtual representation.
1. Notice to a person who may represent and bind another person under this section has the same effect as if notice were given directly to the other person.

2. The consent of a person who may represent and bind another person under this section is binding on the person represented unless the person represented objects to the representation before the consent would otherwise have become effective.

3. The following limitations on the ability to serve as a virtual representative apply:

   a. A trustor may not represent and bind a beneficiary under this section with respect to the termination and modification of an irrevocable trust; and

   b. Representation of an incapacitated trustor with respect to his or her powers over a trust is subject to the provisions of RCW 11.103.030, and chapters 11.96A and 11.130 RCW.

4. To the extent there is no conflict of interest between the representative and the person represented or among those being represented with respect to the particular question or dispute:

   a. A guardian may represent and bind the estate that the guardian controls, subject to chapters 11.96A and 11.130 RCW;

   c. An agent having authority to act with respect to the particular question or dispute may represent and bind the principal;

   d. A trustee may represent and bind the beneficiaries of the trust;

   e. A personal representative of a decedent's estate may represent and bind persons interested in the estate; and

5. Unless otherwise represented, a minor, incapacitated, or unborn individual, or a person whose identity or location is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable, may be represented by and bound by another having a substantially identical interest with respect to the particular question or dispute, but only to the extent there is no conflict of interest between the representative and the person represented with regard to the particular question or dispute.

6. Where an interest has been given to persons who comprise a certain class upon the happening of a certain event, the living persons who would constitute the class as of the date the representation is to be determined may virtually represent all other members of the class as of that date, but only to the extent that there is no conflict of interest between the representative and the person(s) represented with regard to the particular question or dispute.

7. Where an interest has been given to a living person, and the same interest, or a share in it, is to pass to the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner or to persons who are, or might be, the heirs, issue, or other kindred of that living person or the distributees of the estate of that living person upon the happening of a future event, that living person may virtually represent the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, heirs, issue, or other kindred of the person, and the distributees of the estate of the person, but only to the extent that there is no conflict of interest between the representative and the person(s) represented with regard to the particular question or dispute.

8. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7) of this section, where an interest has been given to a person or a class of persons, or both, upon the happening of any future event, and the same interest or a share of the interest is to pass to another person or class of persons, or both, upon the happening of an additional future event, the living person or persons who would take the interest upon the happening of the first event may virtually represent the persons and classes of persons who might take on the happening of the additional future event, but only to the extent that there is no conflict of interest between the representative and the person(s) represented with regard to the particular question or dispute.

9. To the extent there is no conflict of interest between the holder of the power of appointment and the persons represented with respect to the particular question or dispute, the holder of a lifetime or testamentary power of appointment may virtually represent and bind persons who are permissible appointees or takers in default (but only to the extent that they are permissible appointees in the case of a limited power of appointment) under the power, and who are not permissible distributees as defined in RCW 11.98.002.

10. The attorney general may virtually represent and bind a charitable organization if:

    a. The charitable organization is not a qualified beneficiary as defined in RCW 11.98.002 specified in the trust instrument or acting as trustee; or

    b. The charitable organization is a qualified beneficiary, but is not a permissible distributee, as those terms are defined in RCW 11.98.002, and its beneficial interest in the trust is subject to change by the trustor or by a person designated by the trustor.

11. An action taken by the court is conclusive and binding upon each person receiving actual or constructive notice or who is otherwise represented under this section.

12. This section is intended to adopt the common law concept of virtual representation. This section supplements the common law relating to the doctrine of virtual representation and may not be construed as limiting the application of that common law doctrine.

## 11.96A.125 - Mistake of fact or law in terms of will or trust—Judicial and nonjudicial reform.
The terms of a will or trust, even if unambiguous, may be reformed by judicial proceedings under this chapter to conform the terms to the intention of the testator or trustor if it is proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that both the intent of the testator or trustor and the terms of the will or trust were affected by a mistake of fact or law, whether in expression or inducement. This does not limit the ability to reform the will or trust using the binding nonjudicial procedures of RCW 11.96A.220.

## 11.96A.127 - Charitable dispositions by will or trust.

   a. The disposition does not fail, in whole or in part;

   b. The subject property does not revert to the alternative, residuary, or intestate heirs of the estate or, in the case of a trust, the trustor or the trustor's successors in interest; and

   c. The court may modify or terminate the trust by directing that the property be applied or distributed, in whole or in part, in a manner consistent with the testator's or trustor's charitable purposes.

2. A provision in the terms of a will or charitable trust that would result in distribution of the property to a noncharitable beneficiary prevails over the power of the court under subsection (1) of this section to modify or terminate the will provision or trust only if, when the provision takes effect:

   a. The property is to revert to the trustor and the trustor is still living; or

   b. Fewer than twenty-one years have elapsed since the following:

      i. In the case of a charitable disposition in trust, the date of the trust's creation or the date the trust became irrevocable; or

      ii. In the case of a charitable disposition in a will, the death of the testator, in the case of a charitable disposition in a will.

3. For purposes of this title, a charitable purpose is one for the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, the promotion of health, governmental or municipal purposes, or other purposes the achievement of which is beneficial to a community.

Nothing in this chapter eliminates the requirement to give notice to a person who has requested special notice under RCW 11.28.240 or notice under RCW 11.130.080.

\[ [2020 c 312 § 716](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20312%20§%20716); [1999 c 42 § 306](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20306); \]

## 11.96A.140 - Waiver of notice.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, notice of a hearing does not need to be given to a legally competent person who has waived in writing notice of the hearing in person or by attorney, or who has appeared at the hearing without objecting to the lack of proper notice or personal jurisdiction. The waiver of notice may apply either to a specific hearing or to any and all hearings and proceedings to be held, in which event the waiver of notice is of continuing effect unless subsequently revoked by the filing of a written notice of revocation of the waiver and the mailing of a copy of the notice of revocation of the waiver to the other parties. Unless notice of a hearing is required to be given by publication, if all persons entitled to notice of the hearing waive the notice or appear at the hearing without objecting to the lack of proper notice or personal jurisdiction, the court may hear the matter immediately. A guardian of the estate or a guardian ad litem may make the waivers on behalf of the incapacitated person, and a trustee may make the waivers on behalf of any competent or incapacitated beneficiary of the trust. A consul or other representative of a foreign government, whose appearance has been entered as provided by law on behalf of any person residing in a foreign country, may make the waiver of notice on behalf of the person.

Either the superior court or any court on an appeal may, in its discretion, order costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to be awarded to any party: (a) From any party to the proceedings; (b) from the assets of the estate or trust involved in the proceedings; or (c) from any nonprobate asset that is the subject of the proceedings. The court may order the costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to be paid in such amount and in such manner as the court determines to be equitable. In exercising its discretion under this section, the court may consider any and all factors that it deems to be relevant and appropriate, which factors may but need not include whether the litigation benefits the estate or trust involved.

2. This section applies to all proceedings governed by this title, including but not limited to proceedings involving trusts, decedent's estates and properties, and guardianship matters. This section shall not be construed as being limited by any other specific statutory provision providing for the payment of costs, including RCW 11.68.070 and 11.24.050, unless such statute specifically provides otherwise. This section shall apply to matters involving guardians and guardians ad litem.

The court, upon its own motion or upon request of one or more of the parties, at any stage of a judicial proceeding or at any time in a nonjudicial resolution procedure, may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of a minor, incapacitated, unborn, or unascertained person, person whose identity or address is unknown, or a designated class of persons who are not ascertained or are not in being. If not precluded by a conflict of interest, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent several persons or interests.

2. The court-appointed guardian ad litem supersedes the special representative if so provided in the court order.

3. The court may appoint the guardian ad litem at an ex parte hearing, or the court may order a hearing as provided in RCW 11.96A.090 with notice as provided in this section and RCW 11.96A.110.

4. The guardian ad litem is entitled to reasonable compensation for services. Such compensation is to be paid from the principal of the estate or trust whose beneficiaries are represented.

## 11.96A.210 - Purpose.
The purpose of RCW 11.96A.220 through 11.96A.250 is to provide a binding nonjudicial procedure to resolve matters through written agreements among the parties interested in the estate or trust. The procedure is supplemental to, and may not derogate from, any other proceeding or provision authorized by statute or the common law.

\[ [1999 c 42 § 401](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20401); \]

## 11.96A.220 - Binding agreement.
RCW 11.96A.210 through 11.96A.250 shall be applicable to the resolution of any matter, as defined by RCW 11.96A.030, other than matters subject to chapter 11.130 RCW, or a trust for a minor or other incapacitated person created at its inception by the judgment or decree of a court unless the judgment or decree provides that RCW 11.96A.210 through 11.96A.250 shall be applicable. If all parties agree to a resolution of any such matter, then the agreement shall be evidenced by a written agreement signed by all parties. Subject to the provisions of RCW 11.96A.240, the written agreement shall be binding and conclusive on all persons interested in the estate, trust, nonprobate asset, other property passing at death, or custodial property. The agreement shall identify the subject matter of the dispute and the parties. If the agreement or a memorandum of the agreement is to be filed with the court under RCW 11.96A.230, the agreement may, but need not, include provisions specifically addressing jurisdiction, governing law, the waiver of notice of the filing as provided in RCW 11.96A.230, and the discharge of any special representative who has acted with respect to the agreement.

If a party who virtually represents another under RCW 11.96A.120 signs the agreement, then the party's signature constitutes the signature of all persons whom the party virtually represents, and all the virtually represented persons shall be bound by the agreement.

## 11.96A.230 - Entry of agreement with court—Effect.
1. Any party, or a party's legal representative, may file the written agreement or a memorandum summarizing the written agreement with the court having jurisdiction over the estate or trust. The agreement or a memorandum of its terms may be filed within thirty days of the agreement's execution by all parties only with the written consent of the special representative. The agreement or a memorandum of its terms may be filed after a special representative has commenced a proceeding under RCW 11.96A.240 only after the court has determined that the special representative has adequately represented and protected the parties represented. Failure to complete any action authorized or required under this subsection does not cause the written agreement to be ineffective and the agreement is nonetheless binding and conclusive on all persons interested in the estate or trust.

2. On filing the agreement or memorandum, the agreement will be deemed approved by the court and is equivalent to a final court order binding on all persons interested in the estate, trust, nonprobate asset, other property passing at death, or custodial property.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 4022](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%204022); [2001 c 14 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5052-S.SL.pdf?cite=2001%20c%2014%20§%202); [1999 c 42 § 403](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20403); \]

## 11.96A.240 - Judicial approval of agreement.
Within thirty days of execution of the agreement by all parties, the special representative may note a hearing for presentation of the written agreement to a court of competent jurisdiction. The special representative shall provide notice of the time and date of the hearing to each party to the agreement whose address is known, unless such notice has been waived. Proof of mailing or delivery of the notice must be filed with the court. At such hearing the court shall review the agreement on behalf of the parties represented by the special representative. The court shall determine whether or not the interests of the represented parties have been adequately represented and protected, and an order declaring the court's determination shall be entered. If the court determines that such interests have not been adequately represented and protected, the agreement shall be declared of no effect.

\[ [1999 c 42 § 404](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20404); \]

## 11.96A.250 - Special representative.
1. [Empty]

   a. Any party or the parent of a minor or unborn party may petition the court for the appointment of a special representative to represent a party: (i) Who is a minor; (ii) who is incapacitated without an appointed guardian of his or her estate; (iii) who is yet unborn or unascertained; or (iv) whose identity or address is unknown. The petition may be heard by the court without notice.

   b. In appointing the special representative the court shall give due consideration and deference to any nomination(s) made in the petition, the special skills required in the representation, and the need for a representative who will act independently and prudently. The nomination of a person as special representative by the petitioner and the person's willingness to serve as special representative are not grounds by themselves for finding a lack of independence, however, the court may consider any interests that the nominating party may have in the estate or trust in making the determination.

   c. The special representative may enter into a binding agreement on behalf of the person or beneficiary. The special representative may be appointed for more than one person or class of persons if the interests of such persons or class are not in conflict. The petition must be verified. The petition and order appointing the special representative may be in the following form:

## 11.96A.260 - Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that it is in the interest of the citizens of the state of Washington to encourage the prompt and early resolution of disputes in trust, estate, and nonprobate matters. The legislature endorses the use of dispute resolution procedures by means other than litigation. The legislature also finds that the former chapter providing for the nonjudicial resolution of trust, estate, and nonprobate disputes, *chapter 11.96 RCW, has resulted in the successful resolution of thousands of disputes since 1984. The nonjudicial procedure has resulted in substantial savings of public funds by removing those disputes from the court system. Enhancement of the statutory framework supporting the nonjudicial process in *chapter 11.96 RCW would be beneficial and would foster even greater use of nonjudicial dispute methods to resolve trust, estate, and nonprobate disputes. The legislature further finds that it would be beneficial to allow parties to disputes involving trusts, estates, and nonprobate assets to have access to a process for required mediation followed by arbitration using mediators and arbitrators experienced in trust, estate, and nonprobate matters. Finally, the legislature also believes it would be beneficial to parties with disputes in trusts, estates, and nonprobate matters to clarify and streamline the statutory framework governing the procedures governing these cases in the court system.

Therefore, the legislature adopts RCW 11.96A.270 through 11.96A.320, that enhance *chapter 11.96 RCW and allow required mediation and arbitration in disputes involving trusts, estates, and nonprobate matters that are brought to the courts. RCW 11.96A.270 through 11.96A.320 also set forth specific civil procedures for handling trust and estate disputes in the court system. It is intended that the adoption of RCW 11.96A.270 through 11.96A.320 will encourage and direct all parties in trust, estate, and nonprobate matter disputes, and the court system, to provide for expeditious, complete, and final decisions to be made in disputed trust, estate, and nonprobate matters.

\[ [1999 c 42 § 501](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20501); \]

## 11.96A.270 - Intent—Parties can agree otherwise.
The intent of RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320 is to provide for the efficient settlement of disputes in trust, estate, and nonprobate matters through mediation and arbitration by providing any party the right to proceed first with mediation and then arbitration before formal judicial procedures may be utilized. Accordingly, any of the requirements or rights under RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320 are subject to any contrary agreement between the parties or the parties' virtual representatives.

\[ [1999 c 42 § 502](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20502); \]

## 11.96A.280 - Scope.
A party may cause the matter to be presented for mediation and then arbitration, as provided under RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320. If a party causes the matter to be presented for resolution under RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320, then judicial resolution of the matter, as provided in RCW 11.96A.060 or by any other civil action, is available only by complying with the mediation and arbitration provisions of RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320.

\[ [1999 c 42 § 503](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20503); \]

## 11.96A.290 - Superior court—Venue.
As used in RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320, "superior court" means: (1) Before the commencement of any legal proceedings, the appropriate superior court with respect to the matter as provided in RCW 11.96A.040; and (2) if legal proceedings have been commenced with respect to the matter, the superior court in which the proceedings are pending.

\[ [1999 c 42 § 504](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5196.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%2042%20§%20504); \]

The party objecting to arbitration must give notice of the hearing to all parties at least ten days before the hearing and shall include a copy of the petition. At the hearing, the court shall order that arbitration proceed except for good cause shown. Such order shall not be subject to appeal or revision. If the court determines that the matter should not be subject to arbitration, the court shall dispose of the matter by: (a) Deciding the matter at that hearing, but only if the petition objecting to arbitration contains a request for such relief; or (b) directing other judicial proceedings.

4. Selection of arbitrator; qualifications of arbitrator.

   a. If a petition objecting to arbitration is not filed as provided in subsection (3) of this section, or if a court determines that arbitration must apply, each party shall, within thirty days of receipt of the initial notice or within twenty days after the court determination, whichever is later, furnish all other parties or the parties' virtual representatives a list of acceptable arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within ten days after the list is required to be furnished, a party may petition the court to appoint an arbitrator. All parties may submit a list of qualified and acceptable arbitrators to the court no later than the date on which the hearing on the petition is to be held. At the hearing the court shall select a qualified arbitrator from lists of acceptable arbitrators provided by the parties.

   b. A qualified arbitrator must be an attorney licensed to practice before the courts of this state having at least five years of experience in trust or estate matters or five years of experience in litigation or other formal dispute resolution involving trusts or estates, or an individual, who may be an attorney, with special skill or training with respect to the matter. The arbitrator may be the same person selected and used as a mediator under the mediation procedures of RCW 11.96A.300.

5. Arbitration rules. Arbitration must be under *chapter 7.06 RCW, mandatory arbitration of civil actions, as follows:

   a. Chapter 7.06 RCW, the superior court mandatory arbitration rules adopted by the supreme court, and any local rules for mandatory arbitration adopted by the superior court apply to this title. If the superior court has not adopted chapter 7.06 RCW, then the local rules for mandatory arbitration applicable in King county apply, except all the duties of the director of arbitration must be performed by the presiding judge of the superior court.

   b. If a party has already filed a petition with the court with respect to the matter that will be the subject of the arbitration proceedings, then all other parties to the arbitration proceedings who have not yet filed a reply thereto must file a reply with the arbitrator within ten days of the date on which the arbitrator is selected or appointed.

   c. The arbitration provisions of this subsection apply to all matters in dispute. The dollar limits and restrictions to monetary damages of RCW 7.06.020 do not apply to arbitrations under this subsection. To the extent any provision in this title is inconsistent with chapter 7.06 RCW or the rules referenced in (a) of this subsection, the provisions of this title control.

   d. The compensation of the arbitrator must be set by written agreement between the parties and the arbitrator. The arbitrator must be compensated at the arbitrator's stated rate of compensation for acting as an arbitrator of disputes in trusts, estates, and nonprobate matters unless the parties or the parties' virtual representatives agree otherwise.

   e. Unless directed otherwise by the arbitrator in accord with subsection (6) of this section or RCW 11.96A.320, or unless the matter is not resolved by arbitration and the court finally resolving the matter directs otherwise:

      i. Costs of the arbitration, including compensation for the arbitrator's services, must be borne equally by the parties participating in the arbitration, with the details of those costs and fees to be set forth in an arbitration agreement between the arbitrator and all parties to the matter; and

      ii. A party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including legal fees and witness expenses, in connection with the arbitration proceeding.

   f. The arbitrator and the parties shall execute a written agreement setting forth the terms of the arbitration and the process to be followed. This agreement must also contain the fee agreement provided in (d) of this subsection. A dispute as to this agreement must be resolved by the director of arbitration.

   g. The rules of evidence and discovery applicable to civil causes of action before the superior court as defined in RCW 11.96A.290 apply, unless the parties have agreed otherwise or the arbitrator rules otherwise.

6. Costs of arbitration. The arbitrator may order costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expert witness fees, to be paid by any party to the proceedings as justice may require.

7. Decision of arbitrator. The arbitrator shall issue a final decision in writing within thirty days of the conclusion of the final arbitration hearing. Promptly after the issuance of the decision, the arbitrator shall serve each of the parties to the proceedings with a copy of the written arbitration decision. Proof of service shall be filed with the court. Service shall be made in conformity with CR 5(b) of the rules for superior court.

8. Arbitration decision may be filed with the court. The arbitrator or any party to the arbitration may file the arbitrator's decision with the clerk of the superior court at any time after its issuance. Notice of such filing shall be promptly given to each party to the arbitration proceedings.

9. Appeal. (a) The final decision of the arbitrator may be appealed by filing a notice of appeal with the superior court requesting a trial de novo on all issues of law and fact. The notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the date on which the decision was served on the party filing the notice of appeal. A trial de novo shall then be held, including a right to jury, if demanded.

   b. If an appeal is not filed within the time provided in (a) of this subsection, the arbitration decision is conclusive and binding on all parties. If the arbitrator's decision has been filed with the clerk of the superior court, a judgment shall be entered and may be presented to the court by any party on ten days' prior notice. The judgment when entered shall have the same force and effect as judgments in civil actions.

10. Costs on appeal of arbitration decision. The prevailing party in any such de novo superior court decision after an arbitration result must be awarded costs, including expert witness fees and attorneys' fees, in connection with the judicial resolution of the matter. Such costs shall be charged against the nonprevailing parties in such amount and in such manner as the court determines to be equitable. The provisions of this subsection take precedence over the provisions of RCW 11.96A.150 or any other similar provision.
