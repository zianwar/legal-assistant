   b. The principal becomes incapacitated, if the power of attorney is not durable;

   c. The principal revokes the power of attorney;

   d. The power of attorney provides that it terminates;

   e. The purpose of the power of attorney is accomplished; or

   f. The principal revokes the agent's authority or the agent dies, becomes incapacitated, or resigns, and the power of attorney does not provide for another agent to act under the power of attorney.

2. An agent's authority terminates when:

   a. The principal revokes the authority;

   b. The agent dies, becomes incapacitated, or resigns;

   c. An action is filed for the dissolution or annulment of the agent's marriage to the principal or for their legal separation, or an action is filed for dissolution or annulment of the agent's state registered domestic partnership with the principal or for their legal separation, unless the power of attorney otherwise provides; or

   d. The power of attorney terminates.

3. An agent's authority which has been terminated under subsection (2)(c) of this section shall be reinstated effective immediately in the event that such action is dismissed with the consent of both parties or the petition for dissolution, annulment, or legal separation is withdrawn.

4. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, an agent's authority is exercisable until the authority terminates under subsection (2) of this section, notwithstanding a lapse of time since the execution of the power of attorney.

5. Termination of an agent's authority or of a power of attorney is not effective as to the agent or another person that, without actual knowledge of the termination, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest.

6. Incapacity of the principal of a power of attorney that is not durable does not revoke or terminate the power of attorney as to an agent or other person that, without actual knowledge of the incapacity, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest.

7. The execution of a power of attorney does not revoke a power of attorney previously executed by the principal unless the subsequent power of attorney provides that the previous power of attorney is revoked or that all other powers of attorney are revoked.

\[ [2016 c 209 § 110](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5635-S.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20209%20§%20110); \]

## 11.125.110 - Coagents—Successor agents—Liability.
1. A principal may designate in a power of attorney two or more persons to act as coagents. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, all coagents must exercise their authority jointly; provided, however, a coagent may delegate that coagent's authority to another coagent.

2. A principal may designate one or more successor agents to act if an agent resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, is not qualified to serve, or declines to serve. A principal may grant authority to designate one or more successor agents to an agent or other person designated by name, office, or function. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, a successor agent:

   a. Has the same authority as that granted to the original agent; and

   b. May not act until all predecessor agents have resigned, died, become incapacitated, are no longer qualified to serve, or have declined to serve.

3. Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney and subsection (4) of this section, an agent that does not participate in or conceal a breach of fiduciary duty committed by another agent, including a predecessor agent, is not liable for the actions of the other agent.

4. An agent that has actual knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary duty by another agent shall notify the principal and, if the principal is incapacitated, take any action reasonably appropriate in the circumstances to safeguard the principal's best interest. An agent that fails to notify the principal or take action as required by this subsection is liable for the reasonably foreseeable damages that could have been avoided if the agent had notified the principal or taken such action.

\[ [2016 c 209 § 111](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5635-S.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20209%20§%20111); \]

## 11.125.120 - Reimbursement of expenses for agents.
Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, an agent is entitled to reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred on behalf of the principal and to reasonable compensation.

\[ [2016 c 209 § 112](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5635-S.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20209%20§%20112); \]

## 11.125.130 - Accepting appointment as an agent.
Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, a person accepts appointment as an agent under a power of attorney by exercising authority or performing duties as an agent or by any other assertion or conduct indicating acceptance.

\[ [2016 c 209 § 113](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5635-S.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20209%20§%20113); \]

## 11.125.140 - Agents—Duties—Liability—Disclosures.
1. Notwithstanding provisions in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall:

   a. Act in accordance with the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and, otherwise, in the principal's best interest;

   b. Act in good faith; and

   c. Act only within the scope of authority granted in the power of attorney.

2. Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall:

   a. Act loyally for the principal's benefit;

   b. Act so as not to create a conflict of interest that impairs the agent's ability to act impartially in the principal's best interest;

   c. Act with the care, competence, and diligence ordinarily exercised by agents in similar circumstances;

   d. Keep a record of all receipts, disbursements, and transactions made on behalf of the principal;

   e. Cooperate with a person that has authority to make health care decisions for the principal to carry out the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and, otherwise, act in the principal's best interest; and

   f. Attempt to preserve the principal's estate plan, to the extent actually known by the agent, if preserving the plan is consistent with the principal's best interest based on all relevant factors, including:

      i. The value and nature of the principal's property;

      ii. The principal's foreseeable obligations and need for maintenance;

      iii. Minimization of taxes, including income, estate, inheritance, generation-skipping transfer, and gift taxes; and

      iv. Eligibility for a benefit, a program, or assistance under a statute or rule.

3. An agent that acts in good faith is not liable to any beneficiary of the principal's estate plan for failure to preserve the plan.

4. An agent that acts with care, competence, and diligence for the best interest of the principal is not liable solely because the agent also benefits from the act or has an individual or conflicting interest in relation to the property or affairs of the principal.

5. If an agent is selected by the principal because of special skills or expertise possessed by the agent or in reliance on the agent's representation that the agent has special skills or expertise, the special skills or expertise must be considered in determining whether the agent has acted with care, competence, and diligence under the circumstances.

6. Absent a breach of duty to the principal, an agent is not liable if the value of the principal's property declines.

7. An agent that engages another person on behalf of the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person, provided however that the agent shall not be relieved of liability for such person's discretionary acts, that, if done by the agent, would result in liability to the agent.

8. Unless RCW 11.125.110(1) applies, an agent may only delegate authority to another person if expressly authorized to do so in the power of attorney and may delegate some, but not all, of the authority granted by the principal. An agent that exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person, provided however that the agent shall not be relieved of liability for such person's discretionary acts, that, if done by the agent, would result in liability to the agent.

9.
