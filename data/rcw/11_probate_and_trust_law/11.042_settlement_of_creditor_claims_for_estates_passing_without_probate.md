2. A person or group of persons is deemed to have received substantially all of the decedent's probate and nonprobate assets if the person or the group, at the time of the filing of the declaration and oath referred to in subsection (3) of this section, in reasonable good faith believed that the person or the group had received, or was entitled to receive by reason of the decedent's death, substantially all of the decedent's probate and nonprobate assets.

## 11.42.040 - "Reasonably ascertainable" creditor—Definition—Reasonable diligence—Presumptions—Petition for order.
1. For purposes of RCW 11.42.050, a "reasonably ascertainable" creditor of the decedent is one that the notice agent would discover upon exercise of reasonable diligence. The notice agent is deemed to have exercised reasonable diligence upon conducting a reasonable review of the decedent's correspondence, including correspondence received after the date of death, and financial records, including personal financial statements, loan documents, checkbooks, bank statements, and income tax returns, that are in the possession of or reasonably available to the notice agent.

2. If the notice agent conducts the review, the notice agent is presumed to have exercised reasonable diligence to ascertain creditors of the decedent and any creditor not ascertained in the review is presumed not reasonably ascertainable within the meaning of RCW 11.42.050. These presumptions may be rebutted only by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.

3. The notice agent may evidence the review and resulting presumption by filing with the court an affidavit regarding the facts referred to in this section. The notice agent may petition the court for an order declaring that the notice agent has made a review and that any creditors not known to the notice agent are not reasonably ascertainable. The petition must be filed under RCW 11.96A.080, and the notice specified under RCW 11.96A.110 must also be given by publication.

## 11.42.050 - Claims against decedent—Time limits.
1. If a notice agent provides notice under RCW 11.42.020, any person having a claim against the decedent is forever barred from making a claim or commencing an action against the decedent if the claim or action is not already barred by an otherwise applicable statute of limitations, unless the creditor presents the claim in the manner provided in RCW 11.42.070 within the following time limitations:

   a. If the notice agent provided notice under RCW 11.42.020(2) (a) and (b) and the creditor was given actual notice as provided in RCW 11.42.020(2)(c), the creditor must present the claim within the later of: (i) Thirty days after the notice agent's service or mailing of notice to the creditor; and (ii) four months after the date of first publication of the notice;

   b. If the notice agent provided notice under RCW 11.42.020(2) (a) and (b) and the creditor was not given actual notice as provided in RCW 11.42.020(2)(c):

      i. If the creditor was not reasonably ascertainable, as defined in RCW 11.42.040, the creditor must present the claim within four months after the date of first publication of the notice;

      ii. If the creditor was reasonably ascertainable, as defined in RCW 11.42.040, the creditor must present the claim within twenty-four months after the decedent's date of death.

2. Any otherwise applicable statute of limitations applies without regard to the tolling provisions of RCW 4.16.190.

3. This bar is effective as to claims against both the decedent's probate and nonprobate assets.

## 11.42.060 - Claims involving liability or casualty insurance—Limitations—Exceptions to time limits.
The time limitations for presenting claims under this chapter do not accrue to the benefit of any liability or casualty insurer. Claims against the decedent or the decedent's marital community that can be fully satisfied by applicable insurance coverage or proceeds need not be presented within the time limitation of RCW 11.42.050, but the amount of recovery cannot exceed the amount of the insurance. If a notice agent provides notice under RCW 11.42.020, the claims may at any time be presented as provided in RCW 11.42.070, subject to the otherwise relevant statutes of limitations, and does not constitute a cloud, lien, or encumbrance upon the title to the decedent's probate or nonprobate assets nor delay or prevent the transfer or distribution of the decedent's assets. This section does not serve to extend any otherwise relevant statutes of limitations.

## 11.42.070 - Claims—Form—Manner of presentation—Waiver of defects.
1. The claimant, the claimant's attorney, or the claimant's agent shall sign the claim and include in the claim the following information:

   a. The name and address of the claimant;

   b. The name, address, if different from that of the claimant, and nature of authority of an agent signing the claim on behalf of the claimant;

   c. A statement of the facts or circumstances constituting the basis of the claim;

   d. The amount of the claim; and

   e. If the claim is secured, unliquidated, contingent, or not yet due, the nature of the security, the nature of the uncertainty, or the date when it will become due.

Failure to describe correctly the information in (c), (d), or (e) of this subsection, if the failure is not substantially misleading, does not invalidate the claim.

2. A claim does not need to be supported by affidavit.

3. A claim must be presented within the time limits set forth in RCW 11.42.050 by: (a) Serving on or mailing to, by regular first-class mail, the notice agent or the notice agent's attorney a copy of the signed claim; and (b) filing the original of the signed claim with the court in which the notice agent's declaration and oath were filed. A claim is deemed presented upon the later of the date of postmark or service on the notice agent, or the notice agent's attorney, and filing with the court.

4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a claimant makes a written demand for payment within the time limits set forth in RCW 11.42.050, the notice agent may waive formal defects and elect to treat the demand as a claim properly filed under this chapter if: (a) The claim was due; (b) the amount paid was the amount of indebtedness over and above all payments and offsets; (c) the estate is solvent; and (d) the payment is made in good faith. Nothing in this chapter limits application of the doctrines of waiver, estoppel, or detrimental claims or any other equitable principle.

1. The notice agent shall allow or reject all claims presented in the manner provided in RCW 11.42.070. The notice agent may allow or reject a claim, in whole or in part.

2. If the notice agent has not allowed or rejected a claim within the later of four months from the date of first publication of the notice to creditors and thirty days from presentation of the claim, the claimant may serve written notice on the notice agent that the claimant will petition the court to have the claim allowed. If the notice agent fails to notify the claimant of the allowance or rejection of the claim within twenty days after the notice agent's receipt of the claimant's notice, the claimant may petition the court for a hearing to determine whether the claim should be allowed or rejected, in whole or in part. If the court substantially allows the claim, the court may allow the petitioner reasonable attorneys' fees chargeable against the decedent's assets received by the notice agent or by those appointing the notice agent.

## 11.42.085 - Property liable for claims—Payment limits.
1. The decedent's nonprobate and probate assets that were subject to the satisfaction of the decedent's general liabilities immediately before the decedent's death are liable for claims. The decedent's probate assets may be liable, whether or not there is a probate administration of the decedent's estate.
