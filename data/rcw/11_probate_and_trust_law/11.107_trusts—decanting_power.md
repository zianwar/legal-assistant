## 11.107.040 - Decanting statute—Procedure to exercise decanting power.
1. The trustee of the first trust may exercise the decanting power under RCW 11.107.020 and 11.107.030 if:

   a. The trustee determines that the exercise of the decanting power is consistent with the trustee's fiduciary duties described in RCW 11.107.080(1);

2. The trustee of the first trust, qualified beneficiaries, and any other party as defined by RCW 11.96A.030(5) may agree to exercise by the trustee of the decanting power by means of a binding agreement under RCW 11.96A.220.

3. The trustee of the first trust, a qualified beneficiary, a holder of a presently exercisable power of appointment over any part of the first trust, and a person that currently has the right to remove or replace the trustee may petition the court under chapter 11.96A RCW regarding exercise of the decanting power for the following relief, to:

   a. Provide instructions to the trustee regarding whether a proposed exercise of the decanting power is permitted under this chapter and consistent with the fiduciary duties of the trustee;

   b. Approve an exercise of the decanting power;

   c. Determine that a proposed or attempted exercise of the decanting power is ineffective because the proposed or attempted exercise does not or did comply with this chapter or the proposed or attempted exercise would be or was an abuse of the trustee's discretion or a breach of fiduciary duty; or

   d. Order other relief to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

4. The trustee of the first trust may petition the court under chapter 11.96A RCW regarding exercise of the decanting power for the following relief:

   a. An increase of the trustee's compensation under RCW 11.107.070(2)(a)(ii); or

   b. Modification under RCW 11.107.070(4)(b) of a provision granting a person the right to remove or replace the trustee.

5. If there is at least one qualified beneficiary who is not a minor or who has a representative, the trustee is not required to give notice under subsection (1)(c) of this section to a qualified beneficiary who is a minor and has no representative. If all qualified beneficiaries are minors and none has a representative, the trustee must petition for appointment of a guardian ad litem under RCW 11.98A.160 [11.96A.160].

6. The trustee is not required to give notice under this section to a person who is not known to the trustee or is known to the trustee but cannot be located by the trustee after reasonable diligence.

8. The decanting power may be exercised before expiration of the notice period under subsection (1) of this section if all persons entitled to receive notice waive the period in writing. An exercise of the decanting power is not ineffective because of the failure to give notice to one or more persons under subsection (1) of this section if the trustee acted with reasonable care to comply with this section.

## 11.107.050 - Decanting statute—Effects and consequences of an exercise of the decanting power.
1. A trustee or other person that reasonably relies on the validity of a distribution of part or all of the income and principal of a trust to another trust, or a modification of a trust, under this chapter or the law of another jurisdiction is not liable to any person for any action or failure to act as a result of the reliance.

2. A debt, liability, or other obligation enforceable against income and principal of a first trust is enforceable to the same extent against that income and principal when held by the second trust after exercise of the decanting power.

3. For purposes of the law of this state other than this chapter and subject to this subsection, a settlor of a first trust is deemed to be the settlor of the second trust with respect to the portion of the principal of the first trust subject to the exercise of the decanting power. In determining settlor intent with respect to a second trust, the intent of a settlor of the first trust and the intent of a settlor of the second trust, if different, may be considered. The intent of the trustee may also be considered.

4. If the trustee intends to distribute all of the principal of a first trust to a second trust and the trustee makes a good faith effort to do so, the distribution of all of the principal of a first trust to a second trust includes subsequently discovered assets otherwise belonging to the first trust and principal paid to or acquired by the first trust after the distribution of the first trust's principal. If the trustee does not intend to distribute all of the principal of a first trust to a second trust, the distribution of part of the principal of a first trust to a second trust does not include subsequently discovered assets belonging to the first trust or principal paid to or acquired by the first trust after the distribution of principal from the first trust to the second trust, and those assets or that principal remain the assets or principal of the first trust.

5. A reference under this title to a trust instrument or to terms of the trust includes the second trust, the second trust instrument, and the terms of the second trust.

6. The title to all real estate and other property, both tangible and intangible, owned by the first trust remains vested in the second trust without reversion or impairment.

7. An action or proceeding pending by or against the first trust may be continued by or against the second trust as if the decanting had not occurred.

8. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, and purposes of the first trust remain vested in the second trust.

1. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Beneficiary with a disability" means a beneficiary of the first trust who the trustee believes may qualify for governmental benefits based on disability, whether or not the beneficiary currently receives those benefits or is an individual who has been placed under a guardianship or conservatorship under chapter 11.130 RCW.

   b. "Governmental benefits" means financial aid or services from a state, federal, or other public agency.

   c. "Special needs trust" means a trust the trustee believes would not be considered a resource for purposes of determining whether the beneficiary with a disability is eligible for governmental benefits.

2. A trustee may exercise the decanting power under RCW 11.107.020 and 11.107.030 over the property of the first trust as if the trustee had authority to distribute principal to a beneficiary with a disability subject to expanded discretion if:

   a. The second trust is a special needs trust that benefits the beneficiary with a disability; and

   b. The trustee determines that exercise of the decanting power will further the purposes of the first trust.

3. In an exercise of the decanting power under this section, the following rules apply:

   a. The provisions of the second trust for a beneficiary with a disability may:

      i. Meet the medicaid law requirements for an account in a pooled trust for a beneficiary with a disability under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1369p(d)(4)(C), as amended, including requiring a payback to the state of medicaid expenditures of funds not retained by the pooled trust; or

      ii. Meet the medicaid law requirements for a trust for the sole benefit of a beneficiary with a disability under age sixty-five under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1369(d)(4)(A), as amended, including requiring a payback to the state of medicaid expenditures.

   b. RCW 11.107.020(1)(a)(iii) does not apply to the interests of the beneficiary with a disability.

   c. Except as affected by any change to the interests of the beneficiary with a disability, the second trusts, in the aggregate, must grant each other beneficiary of the first trust beneficial interests in the second trusts which are substantially similar to the beneficiary's beneficial interests in the first trust unless inconsistent with (a)(i) or (ii) of this subsection (3).

\[ [2020 c 312 § 720](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20312%20§%20720); [2017 c 29 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5012-S.SL.pdf?cite=2017%20c%2029%20§%206); \]

A trustee may not exercise the decanting power to the extent the first trust instrument expressly prohibits exercise of the decanting power or a power granted by state law to the trustee to modify the trust including, but not limited to, modification pursuant to chapter 11.96A RCW, and any exercise of the decanting power is subject to the prohibition and the prohibition must be included in the second trust instrument or modified first trust instrument. If the first trust instrument contains an express restriction on exercise of the decanting power or such a power to modify the trust, the exercise of the decanting power is subject to the restriction and the restriction must be included in the second trust instrument or modified first trust instrument.

2. [Empty]

   a. Whether or not a first trust instrument specifies a trustee's compensation, the trustee may not exercise the decanting power to increase the trustee's compensation beyond any compensation specified or above the compensation permitted by RCW 11.98.070(26) unless:

      i. All qualified beneficiaries of the second trust consent to the increase in a signed record; or

      ii. The increase is approved by the court.

   b. A change in a trustee's compensation which is incidental to other changes made by the exercise of the decanting power is not an increase in the trustee's compensation for purposes of this subsection (2).

   c. Subject to (b) of this subsection, a second trust instrument may divide and reallocate fiduciary powers among fiduciaries, including one or more trustees or statutory trust advisors, and relieve a fiduciary from liability for an act or failure to act of another fiduciary as permitted by law of this state other than this chapter. This includes but is not limited to directed trusts.

5. A second trust may have a duration that is the same as or different from the duration of the first trust.

6. If a first trust contains a charitable interest, the attorney general has the rights of a qualified beneficiary and may represent and bind the charitable interest and the attorney general has the authority to participate in any proceedings in accordance with chapter 11.110 RCW. If a first trust contains a charitable interest, the second trusts, in the aggregate, may not:

   a. Diminish the charitable interest;

   b. Diminish the interest of any entity that holds the charitable interest; or

   c. Alter any charitable purpose stated in the first trust instrument.

7.

      ii. Construction of terms of the trust; or

      iii. Determining the meaning or effect of terms of the trust.

6. A trustee may exercise the decanting power whether or not the trustee would have made or could have been compelled to make a discretionary distribution of principal at the time of the exercise.

7. If exercise of the decanting power would be effective under this chapter except that the second trust instrument in part does not comply with this chapter, the exercise of the decanting power is effective and the following rules apply to the principal of the first trust subject to the exercise of the power:

   a. A provision in the second trust instrument which is not permitted under this chapter is void to the extent necessary to comply with this chapter.

   b. A provision required by this chapter to be in the second trust instrument which is not contained in the instrument is deemed to be included in the instrument to the extent necessary to comply with this chapter.

8. If a trustee of a second trust discovers that subsection (7) of this section applies to a prior exercise of the decanting power, the trustee must take such appropriate corrective action as is consistent with the trustee's duties.
