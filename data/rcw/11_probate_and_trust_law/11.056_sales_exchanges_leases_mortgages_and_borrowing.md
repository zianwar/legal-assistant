At the hearing of such petition the court may have brought before it such testimony or information as it may see fit to receive, for the purpose of determining whether it should order any of the property of the estate sold, leased or mortgaged. The absence of any allegation in the petition shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to order said sale, lease or mortgage, and the court may, if it see fit, order such sale, lease or mortgage without any petition having been previously presented.

## 11.56.090 - Minimum price—Private sale—Sale by negotiation—Reappraisement.
No sale of real estate at private sale or sale by negotiation shall be confirmed by the court unless the gross sum offered is at least ninety percent of the appraised value thereof, nor unless such real estate shall have been appraised within one year immediately prior to such sale. If it has not been so appraised, or if the court is satisfied that the appraisement is too high or too low, appraisers may be appointed, and they must make an appraisement thereof in the same manner as in the case of the original appraisement of the estate, and which appraisement may be made at any time before the sale or the confirmation thereof.

## 11.56.100 - Confirmation of sale—Approval—Resale.
The personal representative making any sale of real estate, either at public or private sale, or sale by negotiation shall within ten days after making such sale file with the clerk of the court his or her return of such sale, the same being duly verified. In the case of a sale by negotiation the personal representative shall publish a notice in one issue of a legal newspaper of the county in which the estate is being administered; such notice shall include the legal description of the property sold, the selling price and the date after which the sale can be confirmed: PROVIDED, That such confirmation date shall be at least ten days after such notice is published. At any time after the expiration of ten days from the publication of such notice, in the case of sale by negotiation, and at any time after the expiration of ten days from the filing of such return, in the case of public or private sale the court may approve and confirm such sale and direct proper instruments of transfer to be executed and delivered. But if the court shall be of the opinion that the proceedings were unfair, or that the sum obtained was disproportionate to the value of the property sold, or if made at private sale or sale by negotiation that it did not sell for at least ninety percent of the appraised value as in RCW 11.56.090 provided, and that a sum exceeding said bid by at least ten percent exclusive of the expense of a new sale, may be obtained, the court may refuse to approve or confirm such sale and may order a resale. On a resale, notice shall be given and the sale shall be conducted in all respects as though no previous sale had been made.

If, at any time before confirmation of any such sale, any person shall file with the clerk of the court a bid on such property in an amount not less than ten percent higher than the bid the acceptance of which was reported by the return of sale and shall deposit with the clerk not less than twenty percent of his or her bid in the form of cash, money order, cashier's check, or certified check made payable to the clerk, to be forfeited to the estate unless such bidder complies with his or her bid, the bidder whose bid was accepted shall be informed of such increased bid by registered or certified mail addressed to such bidder at any address which may have been given by him or her at the time of making such bid. Such bidder then shall have a period of five days, not including holidays, in which to make and file a bid better than that of the subsequent bidder. After the expiration of such five-day period the court may refuse to confirm the sale reported in the return of sale and direct a sale to the person making the best bid then on file, indicating which is the best bid, and a sale made pursuant to such direction shall need no further confirmation. Instead of such a direction, the court, upon application of the personal representative, may direct the reception of sealed bids. Thereupon the personal representative shall mail notice by registered or certified mail to all those who have made bids on such property, informing them that sealed bids will be received by the clerk of the court within ten days. At the expiration of such period the personal representative, in the presence of the clerk of the court, shall open such bids as shall have been submitted to the clerk within the time stated in the notice (whether by previous bidders or not) and shall file a recommendation of the acceptance of the bid which he or she deems best in view of the requirements of the particular estate. The court may thereupon direct a sale to the bidder whose bid is deemed best by the court and a sale made pursuant to such direction shall need no confirmation: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the court shall consider the net realization to the estate in determining the best bid.
