3. In determining whether it is an appropriate forum, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including:

   a. Any expressed preference of the respondent;

   b. Whether abuse, neglect, or exploitation of the respondent has occurred or is likely to occur and which state could best protect the respondent from the abuse, neglect, or exploitation;
