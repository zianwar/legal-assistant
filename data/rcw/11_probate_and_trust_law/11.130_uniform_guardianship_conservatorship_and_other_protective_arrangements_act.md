## 11.130.001 - Intent.
It is the intent of the legislature to protect the liberty and autonomy of all people of this state, and to enable them to exercise their rights under the law to the maximum extent, consistent with the capacity of each person. The legislature recognizes that people with incapacities have unique abilities and needs, and that some people with incapacities cannot exercise their rights or provide for their basic needs without the help of a guardian. However, their liberty and autonomy should be restricted through guardianship, conservatorship, emergency guardianship, emergency conservatorship, and other protective arrangements only to the minimum extent necessary to adequately provide for their own health or safety, or to adequately manage their financial affairs.

## 11.130.265 - Basis for appointment of guardian for adult.
1. On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may:

   a. Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

      i. The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for physical health, safety, or self-care because the respondent is unable to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision making;

      ii. Appointment is necessary to prevent significant risk of harm to the adult respondent's physical health, safety, or self-care; and

      iii. The respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative; or

   b. With appropriate findings, treat the petition as one for a conservatorship under Article 4 of this chapter or protective arrangement under Article 5 of this chapter, issue any appropriate order, or dismiss the proceeding.

2. The court shall grant a guardian appointed under subsection (1) of this section only those powers necessitated by the demonstrated needs and limitations of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage development of the respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The court may not establish a full guardianship if a limited guardianship, protective arrangement instead of guardianship, or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the respondent.

3. A determination by the court that a basis exists under subsection (1) of this section for the appointment of a guardian and on the issue of the rights that will be retained or restricted by the appointment of a guardian is a legal decision, not a medical decision. The determination must be based on a demonstration of management insufficiencies over time in the area of physical health, safety, or self-care. Age, eccentricity, poverty, or medical diagnosis alone are not sufficient basis under subsection (1) of this section to justify a determination that a guardian should be appointed for the respondent.

   d. The reason a guardianship is necessary, including a brief description of:

      i. The nature and extent of the respondent's alleged need;

      ii. Any protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternatives for meeting the respondent's alleged need which have been considered or implemented;

      iii. If no protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternatives have been considered or implemented, the reason they have not been considered or implemented; and

      iv. The reason a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative is insufficient to meet the respondent's alleged need;

   e. Whether the petitioner seeks a limited guardianship or full guardianship;

   f. If the petitioner seeks a full guardianship, the reason a limited guardianship or protective arrangement instead of guardianship is not appropriate;

## 11.130.280 - Appointment and role of court visitor.
1. On receipt of a petition under RCW 11.130.270 for appointment of a guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint a court visitor. The court visitor must be an individual with training or experience in the type of abilities, limitations, and needs alleged in the petition.

2. The court, in the order appointing a court visitor, shall specify the hourly rate the court visitor may charge for his or her services, and shall specify the maximum amount the court visitor may charge without additional court review and approval.

Within three days of the later of the actual service or filing of the court visitor's statement, any party may set a hearing and file and serve a motion for an order to show cause why the court visitor should not be removed for one of the following three reasons:

      i. Lack of expertise necessary for the proceeding;

      ii. An hourly rate higher than what is reasonable for the particular proceeding; or

      iii. A conflict of interest.

   b. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to the court visitor and all parties. If, after a hearing, the court enters an order replacing the court visitor, findings shall be included, expressly stating the reasons for the removal.

## 11.130.285 - Appointment and role of attorney for adult.
1. [Empty]

   a. The respondent shall have the right to be represented by a willing attorney of their choosing at any stage in guardianship proceedings. Any attorney purporting to represent a respondent or person subject to guardianship shall petition the court to be appointed to represent the respondent or person subject to guardianship.

   b. Unless the respondent in a proceeding for appointment of a guardian for an adult is represented by an attorney, the court is not required, but may appoint an attorney to represent the respondent, regardless of the respondent's ability to pay, except as provided otherwise in (c) of this subsection.

   c. [Empty]

      i. The court must appoint an attorney to represent the respondent at public expense when either:

         A.  The respondent is unable to afford an attorney;

         B.  The expense of an attorney would result in substantial hardship to the respondent; or

         C.  The respondent does not have practical access to funds with which to pay an attorney. If the respondent can afford an attorney but lacks practical access to funds, the court must provide an attorney and may impose a reimbursement requirement as part of a final order.

      ii. When, in the opinion of the court, the rights and interests of the respondent cannot otherwise be adequately protected and represented, the court on its own motion must appoint an attorney at any time to represent the respondent.

      iii. An attorney must be provided under this subsection (1)(c) as soon as practicable after a petition is filed and long enough before any final hearing to allow adequate time for consultation and preparation. Absent a convincing showing in the record to the contrary, a period of less than three weeks is presumed by a reviewing court to be inadequate time for consultation and preparation.

2. An attorney representing the respondent in a proceeding for appointment of a guardian for an adult shall:

   a. Make reasonable efforts to ascertain the respondent's wishes;

   b. Advocate for the respondent's wishes to the extent reasonably ascertainable; and

   c. If the respondent's wishes are not reasonably ascertainable, advocate for the result that is the least restrictive in type, duration, and scope, consistent with the respondent's interests.

1. On receipt of a petition under RCW 11.130.270 and at the time the court appoints a court visitor under RCW 11.130.280, the court shall order a professional evaluation of the respondent.

2. The respondent must be examined by a physician licensed to practice under chapter 18.71 or 18.57 RCW, psychologist licensed under chapter 18.83 RCW, advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, or physician assistant licensed under chapter 18.71A RCW selected by the court visitor who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or disadvantaged by a decision to grant the petition or otherwise have a conflict of interest. If the respondent opposes the professional selected by the court visitor, the court visitor shall obtain a professional evaluation from the professional selected by the respondent. The court visitor, after receiving a professional evaluation from the individual selected by the respondent, may obtain a supplemental evaluation from a different professional.

5. Persons under a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangements—Right to associate with persons of their choosing.

   a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an adult subject to a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement retains the right to associate with other persons of the adult's choosing.

      ii. The restriction is pursuant to a protection order issued under chapter 7.105 RCW, or other law, that limits contact between the adult under a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement and other persons;

      iii. [Empty]

The guardian or limited guardian, the conservator or limited conservator, or the person acting under the protective arrangement has good cause to believe that there is an immediate need to restrict the adult's right to communicate, visit, interact, or otherwise associate with persons of the adult's choosing in order to protect the adult from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or financial exploitation, as those terms are defined in RCW 74.34.020, or to protect the adult from activities that unnecessarily impose significant distress on the adult; and

           B.  Within fourteen calendar days of imposing the restriction under (b)(iii)(A) of this subsection, the guardian or limited guardian, the conservator or limited conservator, or the person acting under the protective arrangement files a petition for a vulnerable adult protection order under chapter 7.105 RCW. The immediate need restriction may remain in place until the court has heard and issued an order or decision on the petition; or

      iv. The restriction is pursuant to participation in the community protection program under chapter 71A.12 RCW.

6. A vulnerable adult protection order under chapter 7.105 RCW issued to protect the adult under a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement as described in subsection (5)(b)(iii)(B) of this section:

   a. Must include written findings of fact and conclusions of law;

   b. May not be more restrictive than necessary to protect the adult from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or financial exploitation as those terms are defined in RCW 7.105.010; and

## 11.130.355 - Termination or modification of guardianship for adult.
1. An adult subject to guardianship, the guardian for the adult, or a person interested in the welfare of the adult may petition for:

   a. Termination of the guardianship on the ground that a basis for appointment under RCW 11.130.265 does not exist or termination would be in the best interest of the adult or for other good cause; or

   b. Modification of the guardianship on the ground that the extent of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause.

2. The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or modification of a guardianship for an adult is appropriate on:

   a. Petition under subsection (1) of this section that contains allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding six months;

   b. Communication from the adult, guardian, or person interested in the welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, including because the functional needs of the adult or supports or services available to the adult have changed;

   c. A report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs of the adult or supports or services available to the adult have changed or a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative for meeting the adult's needs is available; or

   d. A determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best interest of the adult.

3. Notice of a petition under subsection (2)(a) of this section must be given to the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other person the court determines.

4. On presentation of prima facie evidence for termination of a guardianship for an adult, the court shall order termination unless it is proven that a basis for appointment of a guardian under RCW 11.130.265 exists.

5. The court shall modify the powers granted to a guardian for an adult if the powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the abilities or limitations of the adult, the adult's supports, or other circumstances.

6. Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminating or modifying a guardianship for an adult, the court shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the adult which apply to a petition for guardianship.

7. An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to terminate or modify the terms of the guardianship has the right to choose an attorney to represent the adult in the matter. The court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees to the attorney for the adult as provided in RCW 11.130.100.

## 11.130.360 - Basis for appointment of conservator.
1. On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a conservator for the property or financial affairs of a minor if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that appointment of a conservator is in the minor's best interest, and:

   a. If the minor has a parent, the court gives weight to any recommendation of the parent whether an appointment is in the minor's best interest; and

   b. Either:

      i. The minor owns funds or other property requiring management or protection that otherwise cannot be provided;

      ii. The minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age; or

      iii. Appointment is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the minor.

2. On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a conservator for the property or financial affairs of an adult if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

   a. The adult is unable to manage property or financial affairs because:

      i. Of a limitation in the adult's ability to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even with the use of appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision making; or

      ii. The adult is missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States;

   b. Appointment is necessary to:

      i. Avoid harm to the adult or significant dissipation of the property of the adult; or

      ii. Obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the adult or of an individual entitled to the adult's support; and

   c. The adult's identified needs cannot be met by a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternatives.

3. The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated by demonstrated limitations and needs of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage development of the respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The court may not establish a full conservatorship if a limited conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conservatorship, or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the respondent.

4. A determination by the court that a basis under subsection (2) of this section exists for the appointment of a conservator for an adult and on the issue of the rights that will be retained or restricted by the appointment of a conservator is a legal, not a medical decision. The determination must be based on demonstrated management insufficiencies over time in the area of property or financial affairs. Age, eccentricity, poverty, or medical diagnosis alone are not a sufficient basis under subsection (2) of this section to justify a determination that a conservator should be appointed for the respondent.

5. For purposes of subsection (2) of this section, an adult who resides in a long-term care facility, resides in another care setting, or is the subject of an involuntary commitment order is not considered missing or detained.

## 11.130.370 - Notice and hearing for appointment of conservator.
1. All petitions filed under RCW 11.130.365 for appointment of a conservator shall be heard within sixty days unless an extension of time is requested by a party or the court visitor within such sixty-day period and granted for good cause shown. If an extension is granted, the court shall set a new hearing date.

2. [Empty]

   a. A copy of a petition under RCW 11.130.365 and notice of a hearing on the petition must be served personally on the respondent, the court visitor appointed under RCW 11.130.380, and the appointed or proposed guardian not more than five court days after the petition under RCW 11.130.365 has been filed.

Such notice must be in substantially the same form as set forth in RCW 11.130.657 and must be double-spaced and in a type size not smaller than sixteen-point font. The court may not grant the petition if notice substantially complying with this subsection is not served on the respondent.

3. In a proceeding on a petition under RCW 11.130.365, the notice required under subsection (2) of this section must be served upon the persons required to be listed in the petition under RCW 11.130.365(2) (a) through (c) and any other notice party.

   a. The individual subject to conservatorship, if the individual is twelve years of age or older and not missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States;

## 11.130.380 - Appointment and role of court visitor.
1. If the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a conservator is a minor, the court may appoint a court visitor to investigate a matter related to the petition or inform the minor or a parent of the minor about the petition or a related matter.

2. If the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a conservator is an adult, the court shall appoint a court visitor. The duties and reporting requirements of the court visitor are limited to the relief requested in the petition. The court visitor must be an individual with training or experience in the type of abilities, limitations, and needs alleged in the petition.

3. The court, in the order appointing court visitor, shall specify the hourly rate the court visitor may charge for his or her services, and shall specify the maximum amount the court visitor may charge without additional court review and approval. The fee shall be charged to the person subject to a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding unless the court finds that such payment would result in substantial hardship upon such person, in which case the county shall be responsible for such costs: PROVIDED, That the court may charge such fee to the petitioner, the person subject to a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding, or any person who has appeared in the action; or may allocate the fee, as it deems just. If the petition is found to be frivolous or not brought in good faith, the court visitor fee shall be charged to the petitioner. The court shall not be required to provide for the payment of a fee to any salaried employee of a public agency.

4. [Empty]

   a. The court visitor appointed under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall within five days of receipt of notice of appointment file with the court and serve, either personally or by certified mail with return receipt, the respondent or his or her legal counsel, the petitioner or his or her legal counsel, and any interested party entitled to notice under RCW 11.130.080 with a statement including: His or her training relating to the duties as a court visitor; his or her criminal history as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 for the period covering ten years prior to the appointment; his or her hourly rate, if compensated; whether the court visitor has had any contact with a party to the proceeding prior to his or her appointment; and whether he or she has an apparent conflict of interest. Within three days of the later of the actual service or filing of the court visitor's statement, any party may set a hearing and file and serve a motion for an order to show cause why the court visitor should not be removed for one of the following three reasons:

      i. Lack of expertise necessary for the proceeding;

      ii. An hourly rate higher than what is reasonable for the particular proceeding; or

      iii. A conflict of interest.

   b. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to the court visitor and all parties. If, after a hearing, the court enters an order replacing the court visitor, findings shall be included, expressly stating the reasons for the removal. If the court visitor is not removed, the court has the authority to assess to the moving party attorneys' fees and costs related to the motion. The court shall assess attorneys' fees and costs for frivolous motions.

5. A court visitor appointed under subsection (2) of this section for an adult shall interview the respondent in person and in a manner the respondent is best able to understand:

   a. Explain to the respondent the substance of the petition, the nature, purpose, and effect of the proceeding, the respondent's rights at the hearing on the petition, and the general powers and duties of a conservator;

   b. Determine the respondent's views about the appointment sought by the petitioner, including views about a proposed conservator, the conservator's proposed powers and duties, and the scope and duration of the proposed conservatorship; and

   c. Inform the respondent that all costs and expenses of the proceeding, including respondent's attorneys' fees, may be paid from the respondent's assets.

6. A court visitor appointed under subsection (2) of this section for an adult shall:

   a. Interview the petitioner and proposed conservator, if any;

   b. Review financial records of the respondent, if relevant to the court visitor's recommendation under subsection (7)(b) of this section;

   c. Investigate whether the respondent's needs could be met by a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative and, if so, identify the arrangement or other less restrictive alternative; and

   d. Investigate the allegations in the petition and any other matter relating to the petition the court directs.

7. A court visitor appointed under subsection (2) of this section for an adult shall file a report in a record with the court and provide a copy of the report to the respondent, petitioner, and any interested party entitled to notice under RCW 11.130.080 at least fifteen days prior to the hearing on the petition filed under RCW 11.130.365, which must include:

   a. A recommendation:

      i. Regarding the appropriateness of conservatorship, or whether a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative for meeting the respondent's needs is available;

      ii. If a conservatorship is recommended, whether it should be full or limited;

      iii. If a limited conservatorship is recommended, the powers to be granted to the conservator, and the property that should be placed under the conservator's control; and

      iv. If a conservatorship is recommended, the amount of the bond or other verified receipt needed under RCW 11.130.445 and 11.130.500;

   b. A statement of the qualifications of the proposed conservator and whether the respondent approves or disapproves of the proposed conservator;

   d. A statement whether the respondent is able to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings typically are held;

   e. A statement whether the respondent is able to participate in a hearing and which identifies any technology or other form of support that would enhance the respondent's ability to participate; and

   f. Any other matter the court directs.

8. The appointment of a court visitor has no effect on the determination of the adult respondent's legal capacity and does not overcome the presumption of legal capacity or full legal and civil rights of the adult respondent.

## 11.130.385 - Appointment and role of attorney.
1. [Empty]

   a. The respondent shall have the right to be represented by a willing attorney of their choosing at any stage in conservatorship proceedings. Any attorney purporting to represent a respondent or person subject to conservatorship shall petition the court to be appointed to represent the respondent or person subject to conservatorship.

   b. Unless the respondent in a proceeding for appointment of a conservator is represented by an attorney, the court is not required, but may appoint an attorney to represent the respondent, regardless of the respondent's ability to pay, except as provided otherwise in (c) of this subsection.

   c. [Empty]

      i. The court must appoint an attorney to represent the respondent at public expense when either:

         A.  The respondent is unable to afford an attorney;

         B.  The expense of an attorney would result in substantial hardship to the respondent; or

         C.  The respondent does not have practical access to funds with which to pay an attorney. If the respondent can afford an attorney but lacks practical access to funds, the court must provide an attorney and may impose a reimbursement requirement as part of a final order.

      ii. When, in the opinion of the court, the rights and interests of the respondent cannot otherwise be adequately protected and represented, the court on its own motion must appoint an attorney at any time to represent the respondent.

      iii. An attorney must be provided under this subsection (1)(c) as soon as practicable after a petition is filed and long enough before any final hearing to allow adequate time for consultation and preparation. Absent a convincing showing in the record to the contrary, a period of less than three weeks is presumed by a reviewing court to be inadequate time for consultation and preparation.

2. An attorney representing the respondent in a proceeding for appointment of a conservator shall:

   a. Make reasonable efforts to ascertain the respondent's wishes;

   b. Advocate for the respondent's wishes to the extent reasonably ascertainable; and

   c. If the respondent's wishes are not reasonably ascertainable, advocate for the result that is the least restrictive in type, duration, and scope, consistent with the respondent's interests.

3. The court is not required, but may appoint an attorney to represent a parent of a minor who is the subject of a proceeding under RCW 11.130.365 if:

   a. The parent objects to appointment of a conservator;

   b. The court determines that counsel is needed to ensure that consent to appointment of a conservator is informed; or

   c. The court otherwise determines the parent needs representation.

## 11.130.390 - Professional evaluation.
1. On receipt of a petition under RCW 11.130.360 and at the time the court appoints a court visitor under RCW 11.130.380, the court shall order a professional evaluation of the respondent.

2. The respondent must be examined by a physician licensed to practice under chapter 18.71 or 18.57 RCW, psychologist licensed under chapter 18.83 RCW, advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, or physician assistant licensed under chapter 18.71A RCW, selected by the court visitor who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or disadvantaged by a decision to grant the petition or otherwise have a conflict of interest. If the respondent opposes the professional selected by the court visitor, the court visitor shall obtain a professional evaluation from the professional selected by the respondent. The court visitor, after receiving a professional evaluation from the individual selected by the respondent, may obtain a supplemental evaluation from a different professional.

3. The individual conducting the evaluation shall promptly provide the completed evaluation report to the court visitor who shall file the report in a sealed record with the court. Unless otherwise directed by the court, the report must contain:

   a. The professional's name, address, education, and experience;

   b. A description of the nature, type, and extent of the respondent's cognitive and functional abilities and limitations with regard to the management of the respondent's property and financial affairs;

   c. An evaluation of the respondent's mental and physical condition and, if appropriate, educational potential, adaptive behavior, and social skills;

   d. A prognosis for improvement with regard to the ability to manage the respondent's property and financial affairs;

   e. A description of the respondent's current medications, and the effect of the medications on the respondent's cognitive and functional abilities;

   f. Identification or persons with whom the professional has met or spoken with regarding the respondent; and

   g. The date of the examination on which the report is based.

4. If the respondent declines to participate in an evaluation ordered under subsection (1) of this section, the court may proceed with the hearing under RCW 11.130.370 if the court finds that it has sufficient information to determine the respondent's needs and abilities without the professional evaluation.

5. A professional evaluation is not required if a petition for appointment of a conservator under RCW 11.130.360 is for a conservator for the property or financial affairs of a minor or for an adult missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States.

## 11.130.400 - Attendance and rights at hearing.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, a hearing under RCW 11.130.370 may not proceed unless the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible for the respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings typically are held, the court shall make reasonable efforts to hold the hearing at an alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow the respondent to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual technology.

2. A hearing under RCW 11.130.370 may proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

   a. The respondent consistently and repeatedly has refused to attend the hearing after having been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential consequences of failing to do so;

   b. There is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services or technological assistance; or

   c. The respondent is a minor who has received proper notice and attendance would be harmful to the minor.

3. The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under RCW 11.130.370 by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing, assistive technology, or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of these supports. If assistance would facilitate the respondent's participation in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.

4. The respondent has a right to choose an attorney to represent the respondent at a hearing under RCW 11.130.370.

5. At a hearing under RCW 11.130.370, the respondent may:

   a. Present evidence and subpoena witnesses and documents;

   b. Examine witnesses, including any court-appointed evaluator and the visitor; and

   c. Otherwise participate in the hearing.

6. Unless excused by the court for good cause, a proposed conservator shall attend a hearing under RCW 11.130.370.

7. A hearing under RCW 11.130.370 must be closed on request of the respondent and a showing of good cause.

1. The interest of an individual subject to conservatorship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not transferable or assignable by the individual and is not subject to levy, garnishment, or similar process for claims against the individual unless allowed under RCW 11.130.555.

2. If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract after having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the contract is void against the individual and the individual's property but is enforceable against the person that contracted with the individual.

3. A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual subject to conservatorship with respect to property included in the conservatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of this state other than this chapter.

\[ [2019 c 437 § 424](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5604-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20437%20§%20424); \]

## 11.130.540 - Transaction involving conflict of interest.
A transaction involving a conservatorship estate which is affected by a substantial conflict between the conservator's fiduciary duties and personal interests is voidable unless the transaction is authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice under RCW 11.130.420(6) or a subsequent order. A transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate entered into by the conservator, an individual with whom the conservator resides, the spouse, domestic partner, descendant, sibling, agent, or attorney of the conservator, or a corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial beneficial interest.

\[ [2019 c 437 § 425](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5604-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20437%20§%20425); \]

## 11.130.545 - Protection of person dealing with conservator.
1. A person that assists or deals with a conservator in good faith and for value in any transaction, other than a transaction requiring a court order under RCW 11.130.435, is protected as though the conservator properly exercised any power in question. Knowledge by a person that the person is dealing with a conservator alone does not require the person to inquire into the existence of authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conservator's exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of office, or otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A person that pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper application of the property.

2. Protection under subsection (1) of this section extends to a procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for a person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable provisions in law of this state other than this chapter relating to a commercial transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.

\[ [2019 c 437 § 426](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5604-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20437%20§%20426); \]

## 11.130.547 - Access of conservator to certain assets.

2. Institutions shall provide the conservator access and control over the assets described in (a)(vii) of this subsection, including but not limited to delivery of the asset to the conservator, upon receipt of the following:

   a. An affidavit containing as an attachment a true and correct copy of the conservator's letters of conservatorship and stating:

      i. That as of the date of the affidavit, the affiant is a duly appointed conservator with authority over assets held by the institution but owned or subject to withdrawal or delivery to a client or depositor of the institution;

      ii. The cause number of the conservatorship;

      iii. The name of the person under conservatorship and the name of the client or depositor, which names must be the same;

      iv. The account or the safety deposit box number or numbers;

      v. The address of the client or depositor;

      vi. The name and address of the affiant-conservator being provided assets or access to assets;

      vii. A description of and the value of the asset or assets, or, where the value cannot be readily ascertained, a reasonable estimate thereof, and a statement that the conservator receives delivery or control of each asset solely in its capacity as conservator;

      viii. The date the conservator assumed control over the assets; and

      ix. That a true and correct copy of the letters of conservatorship duly issued by a court to the conservator is attached to the affidavit; and

   b. An envelope, with postage prepaid, addressed to the clerk of the court issuing the letters of conservatorship. The affidavit must be sent in the envelope by the institution to the clerk of the court together with a statement signed by an agent of the institution that the description of the asset set forth in the affidavit appears to be accurate, and confirming in the case of cash assets, the value of the asset.

3. Any conservator provided with access to a safe deposit box pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall make an inventory of the contents of the box and attach this inventory to the affidavit before the affidavit is sent to the clerk of the court and before the contents of the box are released to the conservator. Any inventory must be prepared in the presence of an employee of the institution and the statement of the institution required under subsection (1) of this section must include a statement executed by the employee that the inventory appears to be accurate. The institution may require payment by the conservator of any fees or charges then due in connection with the asset or account and of a reasonable fee for witnessing preparation of the inventory and preparing the statement required by this subsection or subsection (1) of this section.

4. Any institution to which an affidavit complying with subsection (1) of this section is submitted may rely on the affidavit without inquiry and is not subject to any liability of any nature whatsoever to any person whatsoever, including but not limited to the institution's client or depositor or any other person with an ownership or other interest in or right to the asset, for the reliance or for providing the conservator access and control over the asset, including but not limited to delivery of the asset to the conservator.

## 11.130.550 - Death of individual subject to conservatorship.
1. Upon the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, a conservator shall:

   a. Have authority to disburse or commit those funds under the control of the conservator as are prudent and within the means of the estate for the disposition of the deceased individual subject to conservatorship's remains. Consent for such arrangement must be secured according to RCW 68.50.160. If no person authorized by RCW 68.50.160 accepts responsibility for giving consent, the conservator may consent, subject to the provisions of this section and to the known directives of the deceased individual subject to conservatorship. Reasonable financial commitments made by a conservator pursuant to this section are binding against the estate of the deceased individual subject to conservatorship;

   b. Deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the individual in the conservator's possession and inform the personal representative named in the will if feasible, or if not feasible, a beneficiary named in the will, of the delivery.

2. If forty days after the death of an individual subject to conservatorship no personal representative has been appointed and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative to administer and distribute the decedent's estate. The conservator shall give notice of his or her appointment and the pendency of any probate proceedings as provided in RCW 11.28.237 and shall also give notice to a person nominated as personal representative by a will of the decedent of which the conservator is aware. The court may grant the application if there is no objection and endorse the letters of office to note that the individual formerly subject to conservatorship is deceased and the conservator has acquired the powers and duties of a personal representative.

3. On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate as provided in RCW 11.130.570.

\[ [2020 c 312 § 223](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20312%20§%20223); [2019 c 437 § 427](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5604-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20437%20§%20427); \]

## 11.130.555 - Presentation and allowance of claim.
1. A conservator may pay, or secure by encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate, a claim against the conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in accordance with the priorities under subsection (4) of this section. A claimant may present a claim by:

   a. Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed; or

   b. Filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court, and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.

2. A claim under subsection (1) of this section is presented on receipt by the conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the claim, whichever first occurs. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed in whole or in part by the conservator in a record sent or delivered to the claimant not later than sixty days after its presentation. Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls until thirty days after disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.

3. A claimant whose claim under subsection (1) of this section has not been paid may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment, or security by encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the conservatorship estate.

4. If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:

   a. Costs and expenses of administration;

   b. A claim of the federal or state government having priority under law other than this chapter;

   c. A claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education, health, or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship;

   d. A claim arising before the conservatorship; and

   e. All other claims.

5. Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under subsection (4) of this section over another claim of the same class. A claim due and payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:

   a. Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without sufficient funds to pay the basic living and health care expenses of the individual subject to conservatorship; and

   b. The court authorizes the preference under *RCW 11.130.435(1)(h).

6. If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all existing claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual subject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security interest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future date.

\[ [2019 c 437 § 428](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5604-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20437%20§%20428); \]

## 11.130.560 - Personal liability of conservator.
1. Except as otherwise agreed by a conservator, the conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the conservator's representative capacity in the contract or before entering into the contract.

2. A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from control of property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission occurring in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate only if the conservator is personally at fault.

3. A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included in the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against the conservatorship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is personally liable for the claim.

4. A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action.

\[ [2019 c 437 § 429](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5604-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20437%20§%20429); \]

## 11.130.565 - Removal of conservator—Appointment of successor.
1. The court may remove a conservator for failure to perform the conservator's duties or other good cause and appoint a successor conservator to assume the duties of the conservator.

2. The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a conservator and appoint a successor on:

   a. Petition of the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator, or person interested in the welfare of the individual which contains allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and appointment of a successor may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding six months;

   b. Communication from the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator, or person interested in the welfare of the individual which supports a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and appointment of a successor may be appropriate; or

3. Notice of a hearing under subsection (2)(a) of this section and notice of the individual's right to be represented at the hearing by counsel of the individual's choosing must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and any other person the court determines.

4. An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to remove the conservator and have a successor appointed has the right to choose an attorney to represent the individual in this matter. The court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees to the attorney as provided in RCW 11.130.100.

5. In selecting a successor conservator, the court shall follow the priorities under RCW 11.130.415.

6. Not later than fourteen days after appointing a successor conservator, the successor conservator shall give notice of the appointment to the individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice under RCW 11.130.420(6) or a subsequent order.

\[ [2019 c 437 § 430](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5604-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20437%20§%20430); \]

4. The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or modification of a conservatorship is appropriate on:

   a. Petition under subsection (3) of this section that contains allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the conservatorship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed within the preceding six months;

   b. A communication from the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator, or person interested in the welfare of the individual which supports a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the conservatorship may be appropriate, including because the functional needs of the individual or supports or services available to the individual have changed;

   c. A report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs or supports or services available to the individual have changed or a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative is available; or

   d. A determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best interest of the individual.

5. Notice of a petition under subsection (3) of this section must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and any such other person the court determines.

11. On termination of a conservatorship by reason of the death of the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator shall file a final report and petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final report within ninety days of death of the person subject to conservatorship.

## 11.130.585 - Basis for protective arrangement instead of guardianship for adult.
1. After the hearing on a petition under RCW 11.130.270 for a guardianship or under RCW 11.130.580(2) for a protective arrangement instead of guardianship, the court may issue an order under subsection (2) of this section for a protective arrangement instead of guardianship if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

   a. If the minor has a parent, the court gives weight to any recommendation of the parent whether an arrangement is in the minor's best interest;

   b. Either:

      i. The minor owns money or property requiring management or protection that otherwise cannot be provided;

   a. Through fraud, coercion, duress, or the use of deception and control caused or attempted to cause an action that would have resulted in financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's property; and

1. [Empty]

   a. The respondent shall have the right to be represented by a willing attorney of their choosing at any stage in protective arrangement proceedings. Any attorney purporting to represent a respondent or person subject to a protective arrangement shall petition the court to be appointed to represent the respondent or person subject to a protective arrangement.

      iii. An attorney must be provided under this subsection (1)(c) as soon as practicable after a petition is filed and long enough before any final hearing to allow adequate time for consultation and preparation. Absent a convincing showing in the record to the contrary, a period of less than three weeks is presumed by a reviewing court to be inadequate time for consultation and preparation.

   a. Make reasonable efforts to ascertain the respondent's wishes;

   b. Advocate for the respondent's wishes to the extent reasonably ascertainable; and

   c. If the respondent's wishes are not reasonably ascertainable, advocate for the result that is the least restrictive alternative in type, duration, and scope, consistent with the respondent's interests.

   a. The parent objects to the entry of an order for a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or conservatorship;

   b. The court determines that counsel is needed to ensure that consent to the entry of an order for a protective arrangement is informed; or

## 11.130.615 - Professional evaluation.
1. On receipt of a petition under RCW 11.130.595 and at the time the court appoints a court visitor under RCW 11.130.605, the court shall order a professional evaluation of the respondent.

2. The respondent must be examined by a physician licensed to practice under chapter 18.71 or 18.57 RCW, psychologist licensed under chapter 18.83 RCW, advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, or physician assistant licensed under chapter 18.71A RCW selected by the court visitor who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or disadvantaged by a decision to grant the petition or otherwise have a conflict of interest. If the respondent opposes the professional selected by the court visitor, the court visitor shall obtain a professional evaluation from the professional selected by the respondent. The court visitor, after receiving a professional evaluation from the individual selected by the respondent, may obtain a supplemental evaluation from a different professional.

   f. Identification or persons with whom the professional has met or spoken with regarding the respondent; and

   g. The date of the examination on which the report is based.

4.

## 11.130.620 - Attendance and rights at hearing.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, a hearing under this article may not proceed unless the respondent attends the hearing.

2. A hearing under this article may proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

   a. The respondent consistently and repeatedly has refused to attend the hearing after having been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential consequences of failing to do so;

   b. There is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services and technological assistance; or

   c. The respondent is a minor who has received proper notice and attendance would be harmful to the minor.

3. The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under this article by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing, assistive technology, or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of these supports. If assistance would facilitate the respondent's participation in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.

4. The respondent has a right to choose an attorney to represent the respondent at a hearing under this article.

5. At a hearing under this article, the respondent may:

Name and address of attorney representing petitioner, if applicable:. . . .

. . . .

Note to petitioner: This form can be used to petition for a guardian, conservator, or both, or for a protective arrangement instead of either a guardianship or conservatorship. This form should not be used to petition for guardianship for a minor.

The court may appoint a guardian or order a protective arrangement instead of guardianship for an adult if the adult lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for physical health, safety, or self-care because (1) the adult is unable to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions even with the use of supportive services, technological assistance, and supported decision making, and (2) the adult's identified needs cannot be met by a less restrictive alternative.

The court may appoint a conservator or order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for an adult if (1) the adult is unable to manage property and financial affairs because of a limitation in the ability to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions even with the use of supportive services, technological assistance, and supported decision making or the adult is missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States, and (2) appointment is necessary to avoid harm to the adult or significant dissipation of the property of the adult, or to obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the adult, or of an individual who is entitled to the adult's support, and protection is necessary or desirable to provide funds or other property for that purpose.

The court may appoint a conservator or order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for a minor if: (1) The minor owns funds or other property requiring management or protection that cannot otherwise be provided; or (2) it would be in the minor's best interests, and the minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age, or appointment is necessary or desirable to provide funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the minor.

The court may also order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship that restricts access to an individual or an individual's property by a person that the court finds: (1) Through fraud, coercion, duress, or the use of deception and control, caused, or attempted to cause, an action that would have resulted in financial harm to the individual or the individual's property; and (2) poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the individual or the individual's property.

Additional rights for persons for whom a conservator has been appointed:

## 11.130.670 - Certified professional guardianship board—Grievances.
1. The certified professional guardianship board must resolve grievances against professional guardians and/or conservators within a reasonable time for alleged violations of the certified professional guardianship board's standards of practice, statutes, regulations, or rules, that relate to the conduct of a certified professional guardian or conservator.

   a. All grievances must initially be reviewed within thirty days by certified professional guardianship board members, or a subset thereof, to determine if the grievance is complete, states facts that describe a violation of the standards of practice, statutes, regulations, or rules, and relates to the conduct of a professional guardian and/or conservator, before investigating, requesting a response from the professional guardian or conservator, or forwarding to the superior courts. To be complete, grievances must provide sufficient details of the alleged conduct to demonstrate that a violation of the statute, regulation, standard of practice, or rule, relating to the conduct of a certified professional guardian or conservator could have occurred, the dates the alleged conduct occurred, and must be signed and dated by the person filing the grievance. Grievance investigations by the board are limited to the allegations contained in the grievance unless, after review by a majority of the members of the certified professional guardianship board, further investigation is justified.

   b. If the certified professional guardianship board determines the grievance is complete, states facts that allege a violation of the certified professional guardianship board's standards of practice, and relates to the conduct of a professional guardian and/or conservator, the certified professional guardianship board must forward that grievance within ten days to the superior court for that guardianship or conservatorship and to the professional guardian and/or conservator. The court must review the matter as set forth in RCW 11.130.140, and must direct the clerk of the court to send a copy of the order entered under this section to the certified professional guardianship board. The certified professional guardianship board must accept as facts any finding of fact contained in the order. The certified professional guardianship board must act consistently with any finding of fact issued in that order.

2. Grievances received by the certified professional guardianship board must be investigated and the resolution determined and in process within one hundred eighty days of receipt. The one hundred eighty days is tolled during any period of time when:

   a. The certified professional guardianship board has provided a certified professional guardian or conservator an opportunity to respond to a grievance against the certified professional guardian or conservator and the certified professional guardianship board is awaiting the certified professional guardian or conservator's response;

   b. The certified professional guardianship board has forwarded a grievance to the superior court for review under subsection (1)(b) of this section and is awaiting receipt of the court's entered order with findings; or

   c. A certified professional guardianship board disciplinary hearing has been requested or is in process and during the time of posthearing board review of the hearing officer's recommendations through issuance of a final certified professional guardianship board's order on the matter.

3. If the grievance cannot be resolved within one hundred eighty days, the certified professional guardianship board must notify the professional guardian and/or conservator. The professional guardian or conservator may propose a resolution of the grievance with facts and/or arguments. The certified professional guardianship board may accept the proposed resolution or determine that an additional ninety days are needed to review the grievance. If the certified professional guardianship board has not resolved the grievance within the additional ninety days the professional guardian or conservator may:

   a. File a motion for a court order to compel the certified professional guardianship board to resolve the grievance within a reasonable time; or

   b. Move for the superior court to resolve the grievance instead of being resolved by the certified professional guardianship board.

4. The superior court has authority to enforce the certified professional guardianship board's standards of practice in this article to the extent those standards are related to statutory or fiduciary duties of guardians and conservators.

5. Any unresolved grievances filed with the certified professional guardianship board one year or more before January 1, 2022, must be forwarded to the superior court for that guardianship or conservatorship for review by the superior court as set forth in RCW 11.130.140 if the grievance is not in process of a hearing or final resolution.

## 11.130.700 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and RCW 11.130.705 through 11.130.755 unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Disability" means, with respect to an individual, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.

2. "Supported decision-making agreement" is an agreement between an adult with a disability and one or more supporters entered into under this chapter.

3. "Supporter" means an adult who has entered into a supported decision-making agreement with an adult with a disability.

\[ [2020 c 312 § 601](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20312%20§%20601); \]

## 11.130.705 - Purpose.
The purpose of RCW 11.130.700 through 11.130.755 is to recognize a less restrictive alternative to guardianship for adults with disabilities who need assistance with decisions regarding daily living.

\[ [2020 c 312 § 602](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20312%20§%20602); \]

## 11.130.710 - Presumption of capacity.
1. All adults are presumed to be capable of managing their affairs.

2. The manner in which an adult communicates with others is not grounds for deciding that the adult is incapable of managing the adult's affairs.

3. Execution of a supported decision-making agreement may not be used as evidence for the petition or appointment of a guardianship or conservatorship under this chapter, and does not preclude the ability of the adult who has entered into such an agreement to act independently of the agreement.

\[ [2020 c 312 § 603](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20312%20§%20603); \]

## 11.130.715 - Scope.
An adult with a disability may voluntarily, without undue influence or coercion, enter into a supported decision-making agreement with a supporter under which the adult with a disability authorizes the supporter to do any or all of the following:

1. Provide supported decision making, including assistance in understanding the options, responsibilities, and consequences of the adult's life decisions, without making those decisions on behalf of the adult with a disability;

2. Assist the adult in accessing, collecting, and obtaining information that is relevant to a given life decision, including medical, psychological, financial, educational, or treatment records, from any person;

3. Assist the adult with a disability in understanding the information described in subsection (2) of this section; and

4. Assist the adult in communicating the adult's decisions to appropriate persons.

\[ [2020 c 312 § 604](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6287-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20312%20§%20604); \]

## 11.130.720 - Authority of supporter.
A supporter may exercise the authority granted to the supporter in the supported decision-making agreement.
