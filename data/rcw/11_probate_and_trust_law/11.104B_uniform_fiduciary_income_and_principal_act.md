## 11.104B.050 - Fiduciary duties—General principles.
1. In making an allocation or determination or exercising discretion under this chapter, a fiduciary shall:

   a. Act in good faith, based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries;

   b. Administer a trust or estate impartially, except to the extent the terms of the trust manifest an intent that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more beneficiaries;

   c. Administer the trust or estate in accordance with the terms of the trust, even if there is a different provision in this chapter; and

   d. Administer the trust or estate in accordance with this chapter, except to the extent the terms of the trust provide otherwise or authorize the fiduciary to determine otherwise.

2. A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power which produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter does not create an inference that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.

3. A fiduciary shall:

   a. Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the receipt between income and principal; and

   b. Charge a disbursement to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the disbursement between income and principal.

4. A fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under RCW 11.104B.070, convert an income trust to a unitrust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(a), change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(c), if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power is necessary to administer the trust or estate in accordance with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.

5. Factors the fiduciary must consider in making the determination under subsection (4) of this section include:

   a. The terms of the trust;

   b. The nature, distribution standards, and expected duration of the trust;

   c. The effect of the allocation rules, including specific adjustments between income and principal, under Articles 4 through 7 of this chapter;

   d. The desirability of liquidity and regularity of income;

   e. The desirability of the preservation and appreciation of principal;

   f. The extent to which an asset is used or may be used by a beneficiary;

   g. The increase or decrease in the value of principal assets, reasonably determined by the fiduciary;

   h. Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the fiduciary power to accumulate income or invade principal or prohibit the fiduciary from accumulating income or invading principal;

   i. The extent to which the fiduciary has accumulated income or invaded principal in preceding accounting periods;

   j. The effect of current and reasonably expected economic conditions; and

   k. The reasonably expected tax consequences of the exercise of the power.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 2201](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%202201); \]

## 11.104B.060 - Fiduciary duties—Judicial review of exercise of discretionary power—Request for instruction.
1. In this section, "fiduciary decision" means:

   a. A fiduciary's allocation between income and principal or other determination regarding income and principal required or authorized by the terms of the trust or this chapter;

   b. The fiduciary's exercise or nonexercise of a discretionary power regarding income and principal granted by the terms of the trust or this chapter, including the power to adjust under RCW 11.104B.070, convert an income trust to a unitrust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(a), change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(c); or

   c. The fiduciary's implementation of a decision described in (a) or (b) of this subsection.

2. The court may not order a fiduciary to change a fiduciary decision unless the court determines that the fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.

3. If the court determines that a fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order a remedy authorized by law. To place the beneficiaries in the positions the beneficiaries would have occupied if there had not been an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order:

   a. The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to adjust under RCW 11.104B.070;

   b. The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to convert an income trust to a unitrust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(a), change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(c);

   c. The fiduciary to distribute an amount to a beneficiary;

   d. A beneficiary to return some or all of a distribution; or

   e. The fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to a beneficiary.

4. On petition by a fiduciary for instruction, the court may determine whether a proposed fiduciary decision will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed decision, contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiary of the reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on which the fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary will be affected by the proposed decision, a beneficiary that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to establish that it will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 2202](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%202202); \]

## 11.104B.070 - Fiduciary duties—Power to adjust.
1. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of a trust or this section, a fiduciary, in a record, without court approval, may adjust between income and principal if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power to adjust is necessary to administer the trust or estate in accordance with the requirements of RCW 11.104B.050(1).

2. This section does not create a duty to exercise or consider the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section or to inform a beneficiary about the applicability of this section.

3. A fiduciary that in good faith exercises or fails to exercise the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section is not liable to a person affected by the exercise or failure to exercise.

4. In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section, a fiduciary shall consider all factors the fiduciary considers relevant, including relevant factors in RCW 11.104B.050(5) and the application of RCW 11.104B.200(9), 11.104B.270, or 11.104B.320.

## 11.104B.460 - Disbursements—Adjustment between income and principal because of taxes.
1. A fiduciary may make an adjustment between income and principal to offset the shifting of economic interests or tax benefits between current income beneficiaries and successor beneficiaries which arises from:

   b. An income tax or other tax imposed on the fiduciary or a beneficiary as a result of a transaction involving the fiduciary or a distribution by the fiduciary; or

   c. Ownership by the fiduciary of an interest in an entity a part of whose taxable income, whether or not distributed, is includable in the taxable income of the fiduciary or a beneficiary.

2. If the amount of an estate tax marital or charitable deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes and, as a result, estate taxes paid from principal are increased and income taxes paid by the fiduciary or a beneficiary are decreased, the fiduciary shall charge each beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax to reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total reimbursement must equal the increase in the estate tax, to the extent the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital or charitable deduction but for the payment. The share of the reimbursement for each fiduciary or beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced must be the same as its share of the total decrease in income tax.

3. A fiduciary that charges a beneficiary under subsection (2) of this section may offset the charge by obtaining payment from the beneficiary, withholding an amount from future distributions to the beneficiary, or adopting another method or combination of methods.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 2507](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%202507); \]

1. This section applies when:

   a. The death of an individual results in the creation of an estate or trust; or

   b. An income interest in a trust terminates, whether the trust continues or is distributed.

2. A fiduciary of an estate or trust with an income interest that terminates shall determine, under subsection (7) of this section and Articles 4, 5, and 7 of this chapter, the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary that is to receive the specific property.

3. A fiduciary shall determine the income and net income of an estate or income interest in a trust which terminates, other than the amount of net income determined under subsection (2) of this section, under Articles 4, 5, and 7 of this chapter and by:

   a. Including in net income all income from property used or sold to discharge liabilities;

   b. Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries, court costs and other expenses of administration, and interest on estate and inheritance taxes and other taxes imposed because of the decedent's death, but the fiduciary may pay the expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims a federal estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent:

      i. The payment of the expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; or

      ii. The fiduciary makes an adjustment under RCW 11.104B.460(2); and

   c. Paying from principal other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of the estate or the winding up of an income interest that terminates, including:

      i. To the extent authorized by the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law, debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, estate and inheritance taxes, and other taxes imposed because of the decedent's death; and

      ii. Related penalties that are apportioned, by the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law, to the estate or income interest that terminates.

4. If a decedent's will, the terms of a trust, or applicable law provides for the payment of interest or the equivalent of interest to a beneficiary that receives a pecuniary amount outright, the fiduciary shall make the payment from net income determined under subsection (3) of this section or from principal to the extent net income is insufficient.

5. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends because of an income beneficiary's death, and no payment of interest or the equivalent of interest is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall pay the interest or the equivalent of interest to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.

6. A fiduciary shall distribute net income remaining after payments required by subsections (4) and (5) of this section in the manner described in RCW 11.104B.510 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary that receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.

7. A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (2) of this section because of a payment described in RCW 11.104B.400 or 11.104B.410, to the extent the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property must be determined by including the amount the fiduciary receives or pays regarding the property, whether the amount accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of the decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and making a reasonable provision for an amount the estate or income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 2601](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%202601); \]

## 11.104B.510 - Death or termination of interest—Distribution to successor beneficiary.
1. Except to the extent Article 3 of this chapter applies for a beneficiary that is a trust, each beneficiary described in RCW 11.104B.500(6) is entitled to receive a share of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to which this section applies, each beneficiary, including a beneficiary that does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to a share of the net income the fiduciary received after the decedent's death, an income interest's other terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary.

2. In determining a beneficiary's share of net income under subsection (1) of this section, the following rules apply:

   a. The beneficiary is entitled to receive a share of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date.

   b. The beneficiary's fractional interest under (a) of this subsection must be calculated:

      i. On the aggregate value of the assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation; and

      ii. Without regard to:

          A.  Property specifically given to a beneficiary under the decedent's will or the terms of the trust; and

          B.  Property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust.

   c. The distribution date under (a) of this subsection may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which the assets are distributed.

3. To the extent a fiduciary does not distribute under this section all the collected but undistributed net income to each beneficiary as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain records showing the interest of each beneficiary in the net income.

4. If this section applies to income from an asset, a fiduciary may apply the rules in this section to net gain or loss realized from the disposition of the asset after the decedent's death, an income interest's terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 2602](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%202602); \]

## 11.104B.550 - Death or termination of interest—When right to income begins and ends.
1. An income beneficiary is entitled to net income in accordance with the terms of the trust from the date an income interest begins. The income interest begins on the date specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to:

   a. The trust for the current income beneficiary; or

   b. A successive interest for a successor beneficiary.

2. An asset becomes subject to a trust under subsection (1)(a) of this section:

   a. For an asset that is transferred to the trust during the settlor's life, on the date the asset is transferred;

   c. For an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of a decedent's death, on the date of the decedent's death.

3. An asset becomes subject to a successive interest under subsection (1)(b) of this section on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under subsection (4) of this section, even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.

4. An income interest ends on the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs or on the last day of a period during which there is no beneficiary to which a fiduciary may or must distribute income.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 2701](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%202701); \]

## 11.104B.560 - Death or termination of interest—Apportionment of receipts and disbursements when decedent dies or income interest begins.

   a. For an estate, the decedent died; or

   b. For a trust or successive interest, an income interest begins.

2. If the due date of a periodic income receipt or disbursement occurs on or after the date on which a decedent died or an income interest begins, a fiduciary shall allocate the receipt or disbursement to income.

3. If an income receipt or disbursement is not periodic or has no due date, a fiduciary shall treat the receipt or disbursement under this section as accruing from day to day. The fiduciary shall allocate to principal the portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent died or an income interest begins, and to income the balance.

4. A receipt or disbursement is periodic under subsections (2) and (3) of this section if:

   a. The receipt or disbursement must be paid at regular intervals under an obligation to make payments; or

   b. The payor customarily makes payments at regular intervals.

5. An item of income or obligation is due under this section on the date the payor is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date.

6. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which RCW 11.104B.200 applies are due:

   a. On the date fixed by or on behalf of the entity for determining the persons entitled to receive the distribution;

   b. If no date is fixed, on the date of the decision by or on behalf of the entity to make the distribution; or

   c. If no date is fixed and the fiduciary does not know the date of the decision by or on behalf of the entity to make the distribution, on the date the fiduciary learns of the decision.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 2702](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%202702); \]

## 11.104B.570 - Death or termination of interest—Apportionment when income interest ends.
1. In this section, "undistributed income" means net income received on or before the date on which an income interest ends. The term does not include an item of income or expense which is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.

2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, when a mandatory income interest of a beneficiary ends, the fiduciary shall pay the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust to the beneficiary or, if the beneficiary does not survive the date the interest ends, to the beneficiary's estate.

3. If a beneficiary has an unqualified power to withdraw more than five percent of the value of a trust immediately before an income interest ends:

   a. The fiduciary shall allocate to principal the undistributed income from the portion of the trust which may be withdrawn; and

   b. Subsection (2) of this section applies only to the balance of the undistributed income.

4. When a fiduciary's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of assets ends, the fiduciary shall prorate the final payment as required to preserve an income tax, gift tax, estate tax, or other tax benefit.
