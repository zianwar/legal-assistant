## 11.110.075 - Trust not exclusively for charitable purposes—Instrument and information not public—Access.
A trust is not exclusively for charitable purposes, within the meaning of RCW 11.110.040, when the instrument creating it contains a trust for several or mixed purposes, and any one or more of such purposes is not charitable within the meaning of RCW 11.110.020, as enacted or hereafter amended.

2. Retaining any "excess business holdings," as defined in section 4943(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, which would give rise to any liability for the tax imposed by section 4943(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;

3. Making any investments which would jeopardize the carrying out of any of the exempt purposes of the trust, within the meaning of section 4944 of the Internal Revenue Code, so as to give rise to any liability for the tax imposed by section 4944(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; and

4. Making any "taxable expenditures," as defined in section 4945(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, which would give rise to any liability for the tax imposed by section 4945(a) of the Internal Revenue Code:

PROVIDED, That this section shall not apply either to those split-interest trusts or to amounts thereof which are not subject to the prohibitions applicable to private foundations by reason of the provisions of section 4947 of the Internal Revenue Code.
