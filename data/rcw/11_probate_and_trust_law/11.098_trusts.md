\[ [2013 c 272 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5344.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20272%20§%208); \]

## 11.98.005 - Trust situs and governing law.
1. If provisions of a trust instrument designate Washington as the situs of the trust or designate Washington law to govern the trust or any of its terms, then the situs of the trust is Washington provided that one of the following conditions is met:

   a. A trustee has a place of business in or a trustee is a resident of Washington; or

   b. More than an insignificant part of the trust administration occurs in Washington; or

   c. The trustor resides in Washington at the time situs is being established, or resided in Washington at the time the trust became irrevocable; or

   d. One or more of the qualified beneficiaries resides in Washington; or

   e. An interest in real property located in Washington is an asset of the trust.

2. [Empty]

   a. Unless the trust instrument designates a state other than Washington as the situs of the trust and does not expressly authorize transfer of situs, the trustee may register the trust as a Washington trust if any of the factors in subsection (1)(a) through (e) of this section are present. The trustee must register the trust by filing with the clerk of the court in any county where venue lies for the trust under RCW 11.96A.050, a statement including the following information:

      i. The name and address of the trustee;

      ii. The date of the trust, name of the trustor, and name of the trust, if any;

      iii. The factor or factors listed in subsection (1)(a) through (e) of this section that are present for the trust and which qualify the trust for registration.

   b. Within five days of filing the registration with the court, the trustee must mail a copy of the registration to each qualified beneficiary who has not waived notice of the registration, in writing, filed in the cause, together with a notice that must be in substantially the same form as set forth in this section. Persons receiving such notice have thirty days from the date of filing the registration to file a petition in the court objecting to such registration and requesting the court to issue an order that Washington is not the proper situs of the trust, and to serve a copy of such petition upon the trustee or the trustee's lawyer. If a petition objecting to the registration is filed within thirty days of the date of filing the registration, the trustee must request the court to fix a time and place for the hearing of the petition and notify by mail, personal service or electronic transmission, if a valid consent to electronic transmission is in effect under the terms of RCW 11.96A.110, all qualified beneficiaries of the time and place of the hearing, not less than ten days before the hearing on the petition.

   c. Unless a person receiving notice of the registration files a petition with the court objecting to the registration within thirty days of the date of filing the registration, the registration will be deemed the equivalent of an order entered by the court declaring that the situs of the trust is Washington. After expiration of the thirty-day period following filing of the registration, the trustee may obtain a certificate of registration signed by the clerk, and issued under the seal of the court, which may be in the form specified in (d) of this subsection.

   d. Notice of registration and certificates of registration may be in the following form:

      i. Notice form:

NOTICE OF FILING OF REGISTRATION OF [NAME AND DATE OF TRUST] AS A WASHINGTON TRUST

NOTICE IS GIVEN that the attached Registration of Trust was filed by the undersigned in the above-entitled court on the . . . . day of . . . . . ., 20. . .; unless you file a petition in the above-entitled court objecting to such registration and requesting the court to issue an order that Washington is not the proper situs of the trust, and serve a copy thereof upon the trustee or the trustee's lawyer, within thirty days after the date of the filing, the registration will be deemed the equivalent of an order entered by the court declaring that the situs of the trust is Washington.

If you file and serve a petition within the period specified, the undersigned will request the court to fix a time and place for the hearing of your petition, and you will be notified of the time and place thereof, by mail, or personal service, not less than ten days before the hearing on the petition.

      ii. Certificate of Registration:

State of Washington, County of . . . . . .

In the superior court of the county of . . . . . .

Whereas, the attached Registration of Trust was filed with this court on . . . ., the attached Notice of Filing Registration of Trust and Affidavit of Mailing Notice of Filing Registration of Trust were filed with this court on . . . ., and no objections to such Registration have been filed with this court, the trust known as . . . ., under trust agreement dated . . . ., between . . . . as Trustor and . . . . as Trustee, is hereby registered as a Washington trust.

Witness my hand and the seal of said court this . . . day of . . . . . ., 20 . . ..

3. If the instrument establishing a trust does not designate any jurisdiction as the situs or designate any jurisdiction's governing law to apply to the trust, and the trustee of the trust has not registered the trust as allowed in subsection (2) of this section, the situs of the trust is Washington if situs has not previously been established by any court proceeding and the additional conditions specified in this subsection (3) are met.

   a. For a testamentary trust, the situs of the trust is Washington if:

      i. The will was admitted to probate in Washington; or

      ii. The will has not been admitted to probate in Washington, but any trustee of the trust resides or has a place of business in Washington, any qualified beneficiary resides in Washington, or any real property that is an asset of the trust is located in Washington.

   b. For an inter vivos trust, the situs of the trust is Washington if:

      i. The trustor is living and Washington is the trustor's domicile or any of the trustees reside in or have a place of business in Washington; or

      ii. The trustor is deceased; and:

          A.  The trustor's will was admitted to probate in Washington; or

          B.  The trustor's will was not admitted to probate in Washington, but any qualified beneficiary resides in Washington, any trustee resides or has a place of business in Washington, or any real property that is an asset of the trust is located in Washington.

   c. If the situs of the trust is not determined under (a) or (b) of this subsection, the determination regarding the situs of the trust is a matter for purposes of RCW 11.96A.030. Whether Washington is the situs must be determined by a court in a judicial proceeding conducted under RCW 11.96A.080 if:

      i. A trustee has a place of business in or a trustee is a resident of Washington; or

      ii. More than an insignificant part of the trust administration occurs in Washington; or

      iii. One or more of the qualified beneficiaries resides in Washington; or

      iv. An interest in real property located in Washington is an asset of the trust.

   d. Determination of situs under (c) of this subsection (3) cannot be made by nonjudicial agreement under RCW 11.96A.220.

## 11.98.008 - Trust creation—Methods.
A trust may be created by:

1. Transfer of property to another person as trustee during the trustor's lifetime or by will or other disposition taking effect upon the trustor's death;

2. Declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds identifiable property as trustee; or

3. Exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trustee.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 15](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2015); \]

## 11.98.009 - Application of chapter.
Except as provided in this section, this chapter applies to express trusts executed by the trustor after June 10, 1959, and does not apply to resulting trusts, constructive trusts, business trusts where certificates of beneficial interest are issued to the beneficiary, investment trusts, voting trusts, trusts in the nature of mortgages or pledges, liquidation trusts, or trusts for the sole purpose of paying dividends, interest, interest coupons, salaries, wages, pensions or profits, trusts created in deposits in any financial institution pursuant to *chapter 30.22 RCW, unless any such trust which is created in writing incorporates this chapter in whole or in part.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 14](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2014); [1985 c 30 § 40](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c30.pdf?cite=1985%20c%2030%20§%2040); [1984 c 149 § 67](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c149.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20149%20§%2067); [1983 c 3 § 49](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c3.pdf?cite=1983%20c%203%20§%2049); [1959 c 124 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1959c124.pdf?cite=1959%20c%20124%20§%201); \]

## 11.98.011 - Trust creation—Requirements.
1. A trust is created only if:

   a. The trustor has capacity to create a trust;

   b. The trustor indicates an intention to create the trust;

   c. The trust has a definite beneficiary or is:

      i. A charitable trust;

      ii. A trust for the care of an animal, as provided in chapter 11.118 RCW; or

      iii. A trust for a noncharitable purpose, as provided in RCW 11.98.015;

   d. The trustee has duties to perform; and

   e. The same person is not the sole trustee and sole beneficiary.

2. A beneficiary is definite if the beneficiary can be ascertained now or in the future, subject to any applicable rule against perpetuities.

3. A power in a trustee to select a beneficiary from an indefinite class is valid, except to the extent that the trustee may distribute trust property to himself or herself. If the power is not exercised within a reasonable time, the power fails and the property subject to the power passes to the persons who would have taken the property had the power not been conferred.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2016); \]

## 11.98.012 - Trust creation—Other jurisdictions.
A trust not created by will is validly created if its creation complies with the law of the jurisdiction in which the trust instrument was executed, or the law of the jurisdiction in which, at the time of creation or in the case of a revocable trust, at the time the trust became irrevocable:

1. The trustor was domiciled, had a residence, or was a national;

2. The trustee was domiciled or had a place of business; or

3. Any trust property was located.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 17](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2017); \]

## 11.98.013 - Trust creation—Allowable purposes.
A trust may be created only to the extent its purposes are lawful, not contrary to public policy, and possible to achieve.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 18](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2018); \]

## 11.98.014 - Trust creation—Oral trusts.
Except as required by a statute other than this title, a trust need not be evidenced by a trust instrument, but the creation of an oral trust and its terms may be established only by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 19](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2019); \]

## 11.98.015 - Noncharitable trusts without ascertainable beneficiaries.
Except as otherwise provided in chapter 11.118 RCW or by another statute, the following rules apply:

1. A trust may be created for a noncharitable purpose without a definite or definitely ascertainable beneficiary or for a noncharitable but otherwise valid purpose to be selected by the trustee. The trust may not be enforced for longer than the time period specified in RCW 11.98.130 as the period during which a trust cannot be deemed to violate the rule against perpetuities;

2. A trust authorized by this section may be enforced by a person appointed in the terms of the trust or, if no person is so appointed, by a person appointed by the court. Such person is considered to be a permissible distributee of the trust; and

3. Property of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to its intended use, except to the extent the court determines that the value of the trust property exceeds the amount required for the intended use. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of the trust, property not required for the intended use must be distributed to the trustor, if then living, otherwise to the trustor's successors in interest. Successors in interest include the beneficiaries under the trustor's will, if the trustor has a will, or, in the absence of an effective will provision, the trustor's heirs.

\[ [2013 c 272 § 22](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5344.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20272%20§%2022); [2011 c 327 § 20](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2020); \]

## 11.98.016 - Exercise of powers by co-trustees.
1. Any power vested in three or more trustees jointly may be exercised by a majority of such trustees; but no trustee who has not joined in exercising a power is liable to the beneficiaries or to others for the consequences of such exercise; nor is a dissenting trustee liable for the consequences of an act in which that trustee joins at the direction of the majority of the trustees, if that trustee expressed his or her dissent in writing to each of the co-trustees at or before the time of such joinder.

2. Where two or more trustees are appointed to execute a trust and one or more of them for any reason does not accept the appointment or having accepted ceases to be a trustee, the survivor or survivors shall execute the trust and shall succeed to all the powers, duties and discretionary authority given to the trustees jointly.

3. An individual trustee, with a co-trustee's consent, may, by a signed, written instrument, delegate any power, duty, or authority as trustee to that co-trustee. This delegation is effective upon delivery of the instrument to that co-trustee and may be revoked at any time by delivery of a similar signed, written instrument to that co-trustee. However, if a power, duty, or authority is expressly conferred upon only one trustee, it shall not be delegated to a co-trustee. If that power, duty, or authority is expressly excluded from exercise by a trustee, it shall not be delegated to the excluded trustee.

4. If one trustee gives written notice to all other co-trustees of an action that the trustee proposes be taken, then the failure of any co-trustee to deliver a written objection to the proposal to the trustee, at the trustee's then address of record and within fifteen days from the date the co-trustee actually receives the notice, constitutes formal approval by the co-trustee, unless the co-trustee had previously given written notice that was unrevoked at the time of the trustee's notice, to that trustee that this fifteen-day notice provision is inoperative.

5. As to any effective delegation made under subsection (3) of this section, a co-trustee has no liability for failure to participate in the administration of the trust.

Nothing in this section, however, otherwise excuses a co-trustee from liability for failure to participate in the administration of the trust and nothing in this section, including subsection (3) of this section, excuses a co-trustee from liability for the failure to attempt to prevent a breach of trust.

\[ [1985 c 30 § 41](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c30.pdf?cite=1985%20c%2030%20§%2041); [1984 c 149 § 68](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c149.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20149%20§%2068); [1959 c 124 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1959c124.pdf?cite=1959%20c%20124%20§%203); \]

## 11.98.017 - Trusteeship—Accepting and declining—Powers without acceptance.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a person designated as trustee accepts the trusteeship:

   a. By substantially complying with a method of acceptance provided in the terms of the trust; or

   b. If the terms of the trust do not provide a method of acceptance or the method provided in the terms is not expressly made exclusive, by accepting delivery of the trust property, exercising powers or performing duties as trustee, or otherwise indicating acceptance of the trusteeship.

2. A person designated as trustee who has not yet accepted the trusteeship may decline the trusteeship by delivering a written declination of the trusteeship to the trustor or, if the trustor is deceased or is incapacitated, to a successor trustee, if any, and if none, to a qualified beneficiary.

3. A person designated as trustee, without accepting the trusteeship, may:

   a. Act to preserve the trust property if, within a reasonable time after acting, the person sends a written declination of the trusteeship to the trustor or, if the trustor is dead or is incapacitated, to a successor trustee, if any, and if none, to a qualified beneficiary; and

   b. Inspect or investigate trust property to determine potential liability under environmental or other law or for any other purpose.

\[ [2013 c 272 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5344.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20272%20§%2010); \]

## 11.98.019 - Relinquishment of powers by trustee.
Any trustee may, by written instrument delivered to any then acting co-trustee and to the permissible distributees of the trust, relinquish to any extent and upon any terms any or all of the trustee's powers, rights, authorities, or discretions that are or may be tax sensitive in that they cause or may cause adverse tax consequences to the trustee or the trust. Any trustee not relinquishing such a power, right, authority, or discretion and upon whom it is conferred continues to have full power to exercise it.

\[ [2013 c 272 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5344.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20272%20§%2011); [1985 c 30 § 42](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c30.pdf?cite=1985%20c%2030%20§%2042); [1984 c 149 § 69](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c149.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20149%20§%2069); \]

## 11.98.039 - Nonjudicial change of trustee—Judicial appointment or change of trustee—Liability and duties of successor fiduciary.
1. Where a vacancy occurs in the office of the trustee and there is a successor trustee who is willing to serve as trustee and (a) is named in the governing instrument as successor trustee or (b) has been selected to serve as successor trustee under the procedure established in the governing instrument for the selection of a successor trustee, the outgoing trustee, or any other interested party, must give notice of such vacancy, whether arising because of the trustee's resignation or because of any other reason, and of the successor trustee's agreement to serve as trustee, to each permissible distributee. The successor trustee named in the governing instrument or selected pursuant to the procedure therefor established in the governing instrument is entitled to act as trustee except for good cause or disqualification. The successor trustee is deemed to have accepted the trusteeship as of the effective date of the discharge of the predecessor trustee as provided in RCW 11.98.041.

2. Where a vacancy exists or occurs in the office of the trustee and there is no successor trustee who is named in the governing instrument or who has been selected to serve as successor trustee under the procedure established in the governing instrument for the selection of a successor trustee, and who is willing to serve as trustee, then all parties with an interest in the trust may agree to a nonjudicial change of the trustee under RCW 11.96A.220. The successor trustee is deemed to have accepted the trusteeship as of the effective date of the discharge of the predecessor trustee as provided in RCW 11.98.041 or, in circumstances where there is no predecessor trustee, as of the effective date of the trustee's appointment.

3. When there is a desire to name one or more cotrustees to serve with the existing trustee, then all parties with an interest in the trust may agree to the nonjudicial addition of one or more cotrustees under RCW 11.96A.220. The additional cotrustee is deemed to have accepted the trusteeship as of the effective date of the cotrustee's appointment.

4. Unless subsection (1), (2), or (3) of this section applies, any beneficiary of a trust, the trustor, if alive, or the trustee may petition the superior court having jurisdiction for the appointment or change of a trustee or cotrustee under the procedures provided in RCW 11.96A.080 through 11.96A.200: (a) Whenever the office of trustee becomes vacant; (b) upon filing of a petition of resignation by a trustee; or (c) for any other reasonable cause.

5. For purposes of this subsection, the term fiduciary includes both trustee and personal representative.

   a. Except as otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a successor fiduciary, absent actual knowledge of a breach of fiduciary duty: (i) Is not liable for any act or omission of a predecessor fiduciary and is not obligated to inquire into the validity or propriety of any such act or omission; (ii) is authorized to accept as conclusively accurate any accounting or statement of assets tendered to the successor fiduciary by a predecessor fiduciary; and (iii) is authorized to receipt only for assets actually delivered and has no duty to make further inquiry as to undisclosed assets of the trust or estate.

   b. Nothing in this section relieves a successor fiduciary from liability for retaining improper investments, nor does this section in any way bar the successor fiduciary, trust beneficiaries, or other party in interest from bringing an action against a predecessor fiduciary arising out of the acts or omissions of the predecessor fiduciary, nor does it relieve the successor fiduciary of liability for its own acts or omissions except as specifically stated or authorized in this section.

6. A change of trustee to a foreign trustee does not change the situs of the trust. Transfer of situs of a trust to another jurisdiction requires compliance with RCW 11.98.005 and RCW 11.98.045 through 11.98.055.

   a. Selecting a delegate;

   b. Establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes and terms of the trust;

   c. Periodically reviewing the delegate's actions in order to monitor the delegate's performance and compliance with the terms of the delegation; and

3. A trustee who complies with subsection (1) of this section is not liable to the beneficiaries or to the trust for an action of the delegate to whom the function was delegated. Nothing in this section relieves the trustee from any existing duty to compel the delegate to account for the delegate's actions.

4. By accepting a delegation of powers or duties from the trustee of a trust that is subject to the law of this state, a delegate submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.

5. A delegation among co-trustees is governed by RCW 11.98.016.

## 11.98.072 - Trustee—Notification requirements.
1. A trustee must keep all qualified beneficiaries of a trust reasonably informed about the administration of the trust and of the material facts necessary for them to protect their interests. Unless unreasonable under the circumstances, a trustee must promptly respond to any beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust. The trustee is deemed to have satisfied the request of a qualified beneficiary who requests information concerning the terms of the trust reasonably necessary to enable such beneficiary to enforce his or her rights under the trust if the trustee provides a copy of the entire trust instrument. If a qualified beneficiary must compel production of information from the trustee by order of the court, then the court may order costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to be awarded to such beneficiary pursuant to RCW 11.96A.150.

2. [Empty]

   a. Except to the extent waived or modified as provided in subsection (5) of this section, within sixty days after the date of acceptance of the position of trustee, the trustee must give notice to the qualified beneficiaries of the trust of:

3. Despite any other provision of this section, and except to the extent waived or modified as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the trustee may not be required to provide any information described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section to any beneficiary of a trust other than the trustor's spouse or domestic partner if:

   a. Such spouse or domestic partner has capacity;

   b. Such spouse or domestic partner is the only permissible distributee of the trust; and

   c. All of the other qualified beneficiaries of the trust are the descendants of the trustor and the trustor's spouse or domestic partner.

4. While the trustor of a revocable trust is living, no beneficiary other than the trustor is entitled to receive any information under this section.

5. The trustor may waive or modify the notification requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section in the trust document or in a separate writing, made at any time, that is delivered to the trustee.

\[ [2013 c 272 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5344.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20272%20§%2016); \]

## 11.98.075 - Certification of trust.
1. Instead of furnishing a copy of the trust instrument to a person other than a beneficiary, the trustee may furnish to the person a certification of trust containing the following information:

   a. That the trust exists and the date the trust instrument was executed;

   b. The identity of the trustor;

   c. The identity and address of the currently acting trustee;

   d. Relevant powers of the trustee;

   e. The revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;

   f. The authority of cotrustees to sign or otherwise authenticate and whether all or less than all are required in order to exercise powers of the trustee; and

   g. The name of the trust or the titling of the trust property.

2. A certification of trust may be signed or otherwise authenticated by any trustee or by an attorney for the trust.

3. A certification of trust must state that the trust has not been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect.

4. A certification of trust need not contain the dispositive terms of a trust.

5. A recipient of a certification of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments which designate the trustee and confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction or any other reasonable information.

6. A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification. Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification.

7. A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct.

8. A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust or excerpts is liable for damages, including reasonable attorney fees, if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding the trust instrument.

9. This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 31](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2031); \]

## 11.98.078 - Trustee duty of loyalty.
1. A trustee must administer the trust solely in the interests of the beneficiaries.

2. Subject to the rights of persons dealing with or assisting the trustee as provided in RCW 11.98.105, a sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the investment or management of trust property entered into by the trustee for the trustee's own personal account or which is otherwise affected by a conflict between the trustee's fiduciary and personal interests is voidable by a beneficiary affected by the transaction unless:

   a. The transaction was authorized by the terms of the trust;

   b. The transaction was approved by the court or approved in a nonjudicial binding agreement in compliance with RCW 11.96A.210 through 11.96A.250;

   c. The beneficiary did not commence a judicial proceeding within the time allowed by RCW 11.96A.070;

   d. The beneficiary consented to the trustee's conduct, ratified the transaction, or released the trustee in compliance with RCW 11.98.108; or

   e. The transaction involves a contract entered into or claim acquired by the trustee before the person became or contemplated becoming trustee.

3. [Empty]

   a. A sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the investment or management of trust property is presumed to be "otherwise affected" by a conflict between fiduciary and personal interests under this section if it is entered into by the trustee with:

      i. The trustee's spouse or registered domestic partner;

      ii. The trustee's descendants, siblings, parents, or their spouses or registered domestic partners;

      iii. An agent or attorney of the trustee; or

      iv. A corporation or other person or enterprise in which the trustee, or a person that owns a significant interest in the trustee, has an interest that might affect the trustee's best judgment.

   b. The presumption is rebutted if the trustee establishes that the conflict did not adversely affect the interests of the beneficiaries.

4. A sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the investment or management of trust property entered into by the trustee for the trustee's own personal account that is voidable under subsection (2) of this section may be voided by a beneficiary without further proof.

5. An investment by a trustee in securities of an investment company or investment trust to which the trustee, or its affiliate, provides services in a capacity other than as trustee is not presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the investment complies with the prudent investor rule of chapter 11.100 RCW. In addition to its compensation for acting as trustee, the trustee may be compensated by the investment company or investment trust for providing those services out of fees charged to the trust. If the trustee receives compensation from the investment company or investment trust for providing investment advisory or investment management services, the trustee must at least annually notify the permissible distributees of the rate and method by which that compensation was determined. The obligation of the trustee to provide the notice described in this section may be waived or modified by the trustor in the trust document or in a separate writing, made at any time, that is delivered to the trustee.

6. The following transactions, if fair to the beneficiaries, cannot be voided under this section:

   a. An agreement between a trustee and a beneficiary relating to the appointment or compensation of the trustee;

   b. Payment of reasonable compensation to the trustee and any affiliate providing services to the trust, provided total compensation is reasonable;

   c. A transaction between a trust and another trust, decedent's estate, or guardianship of which the trustee is a fiduciary or in which a beneficiary has an interest;

   d. A deposit of trust money in a regulated financial-service institution operated by the trustee or its affiliate;

   e. A delegation and any transaction made pursuant to the delegation from a trustee to an agent that is affiliated or associated with the trustee; or

7. The court may appoint a special fiduciary to make a decision with respect to any proposed transaction that might violate this section if entered into by the trustee.

8. If a trust has two or more beneficiaries, the trustee must act impartially in administering the trust and distributing the trust property, giving due regard to the beneficiaries' respective interests.

## 11.98.080 - Consolidation of trusts.
1. [Empty]

   a. Two or more trusts may be consolidated if:

      i. The trusts so provide; or

      ii. Whether provided in the trusts or not, the requirements of subsection (2), (3), or (4) of this section are satisfied.

   b. Consolidation under subsection (2), (3), or (4) of this section is permitted only if:

      i. The dispositive provisions of each trust to be consolidated are substantially similar;

      ii. Consolidation is not inconsistent with the intent of the trustor with regard to any trust to be consolidated; and

      iii. Consolidation would facilitate administration of the trusts and would not materially impair the interests of the beneficiaries.

   c. Trusts may be consolidated whether created inter vivos or by will, by the same or different instruments, by the same or different trustors, whether the trustees are the same, and regardless of where the trusts were created or administered.

2. [Empty]

   a. A trustee must deliver sixty days in advance written notice of a proposed consolidation in the manner provided in RCW 11.96A.110 to the qualified beneficiaries of every trust affected by the consolidation and to any trustee of such trusts who does not join in the notice. The notice must: (i) State the name and mailing address of the trustee; (ii) include a copy of the governing instrument of each trust to be consolidated; (iii) include a statement of assets and liabilities of each trust to be consolidated, dated within ninety days of the notice; (iv) fully describe the terms and manner of consolidation; and (v) state the reasons supporting the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section. The notice must advise the recipient of the right to petition for a judicial determination of the proposed consolidation as provided in subsection (4) of this section, and must indicate that the recipient has thirty days to object to the proposed consolidation.

   b. If the trustee receives written objection to the proposed consolidation from any trustee or beneficiary entitled to notice or from their representatives within the objection period provided in subsection (a) of this section, the trustee(s) may not consolidate the trusts as provided in the notice, though an objection does not preclude the trustee or a beneficiary's right to petition for a judicial determination of the proposed consolidation as provided in subsection (4) of this section. If the trustee does not receive any objection within the objection period provided above, then the trustee may consolidate the trusts, and such will be deemed the equivalent of an order entered by the court declaring that the trusts were combined in the manner provided in the initial notice.

3. The trustees of two or more trusts may consolidate the trusts on such terms and conditions as appropriate without court approval as provided in RCW 11.96A.220.

   b. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section have been satisfied, it may direct consolidation of two or more trusts on such terms and conditions as appropriate. The court in its discretion may provide for payment from one or more of the trusts of reasonable fees and expenses for any party to the proceeding.

5. This section applies to all trusts whenever created. Any person dealing with the trustee of the resulting consolidated trust is entitled to rely on the authority of that trustee to act and is not obliged to inquire into the validity or propriety of the consolidation under this section.

6. For powers of fiduciaries to divide trusts, see RCW 11.108.025.

   a. The amount required to restore the value of the trust property and trust distributions to what they would have been had the breach not occurred; or

   b. The profit the trustee made by reason of the breach.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if more than one trustee is liable to the beneficiaries for a breach of trust, a trustee is entitled to contribution from the other trustee or trustees. A trustee is not entitled to contribution if the trustee was substantially more at fault than another trustee or if the trustee committed the breach of trust in bad faith or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries. A trustee who received a benefit from the breach of trust is not entitled to contribution from another trustee to the extent of the benefit received.

## 11.98.100 - Nonliability for action or inaction based on lack of knowledge of events.
When the happening of any event, including but not limited to such events as marriage, divorce, performance of educational requirements, or death, affects the administration or distribution of the trust, then a trustee who has exercised reasonable care to ascertain the happening of the event is not liable for any action or inaction based on lack of knowledge of the event. A corporate trustee is not liable prior to receiving such knowledge or notice in its trust department office where the trust is being administered.

\[ [1985 c 30 § 53](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c30.pdf?cite=1985%20c%2030%20§%2053); [1984 c 149 § 84](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c149.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20149%20§%2084); [1959 c 124 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1959c124.pdf?cite=1959%20c%20124%20§%209); \]

## 11.98.105 - Nonliability of third persons without knowledge of breach.
1. A person other than a beneficiary who in good faith assists a trustee, or who in good faith and for value deals with a trustee, without knowledge that the trustee is exceeding or improperly exercising the trustee's powers is protected from liability as if the trustee properly exercised the power.

2. A person other than a beneficiary who in good faith deals with a trustee is not required to inquire into the extent of the trustee's powers or the propriety of their exercise.

3. A person who in good faith delivers assets to a trustee need not ensure their proper application.

4. A person other than a beneficiary who in good faith assists a former trustee, or who in good faith and for value deals with a former trustee, without knowledge that the trusteeship has terminated is protected from liability as if the former trustee were still a trustee.

5. Comparable protective provisions of other laws relating to commercial transactions or transfer of securities by fiduciaries prevail over the protection provided by this section.

## 11.98.107 - Trustee exculpation.
1. An exculpatory term which was inserted as the result of an abuse of a fiduciary or confidential relationship between the trustor and the trustee is unenforceable.

2. An exculpatory term drafted or caused to be drafted by the trustee is invalid as an abuse of a fiduciary or confidential relationship unless the trustee proves that the exculpatory term is fair under the circumstances and that its existence and contents were adequately communicated to the trustor.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 29](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2029); \]

## 11.98.108 - Nonliability of trustee—Beneficiary's consent, release, or ratification.
A trustee is not liable to a beneficiary for breach of trust if the beneficiary consented to the conduct constituting the breach, released the trustee from liability for the breach, or ratified the transaction constituting the breach, unless:

1. The consent, release, or ratification of the beneficiary was induced by improper conduct of the trustee; or

2. At the time of the consent, release, or ratification, the beneficiary did not know of the beneficiary's rights or of the material facts relating to the breach.

\[ [2011 c 327 § 30](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1051-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20327%20§%2030); \]

## 11.98.110 - Contract and tort liability.
As used in this section, a trust includes a probate estate, and a trustee includes a personal representative. The words "trustee" and "as trustee" mean "personal representative" and "as personal representative" where this section is being construed in regard to personal representatives.

Actions on contracts which have been transferred to a trust and on contracts made by a trustee, and actions in tort for personal liability incurred by a trustee in the course of administration may be maintained by the party in whose favor the cause of action has accrued as follows:

1. The plaintiff may sue the trustee in the trustee's representative capacity and any judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff is collectible by execution out of the trust property: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, If the action is in tort, collection shall not be had from the trust property unless the court determines in the action that (a) the tort was a common incident of the kind of business activity in which the trustee or the trustee's predecessor was properly engaged for the trust; or (b) that, although the tort was not a common incident of such activity, neither the trustee nor the trustee's predecessor, nor any officer or employee of the trustee or the trustee's predecessor, was guilty of personal fault in incurring the liability; or (c) that, although the tort did not fall within classes (a) or (b) above, it increased the value of the trust property. If the tort is within classes (a) or (b) above, collection may be had of the full amount of damage proved, and if the tort is within class (c) above, collection may be had only to the extent of the increase in the value of the trust property.

2. If the action is on a contract made by the trustee, the trustee may be held personally liable on the contract, if personal liability is not excluded. Either the addition by the trustee of the words "trustee" or "as trustee" after the signature of a trustee to a contract or the transaction of business as trustee under an assumed name in compliance with chapter 19.80 RCW excludes the trustee from personal liability. If the action is on a contract transferred to the trust or trustee, subject to any rights therein vested at time of the transfer, the trustee is personally liable only if he or she has in writing assumed that liability.

3. In any such action against the trustee in the trustee's representative capacity the plaintiff need not prove that the trustee could have secured reimbursement from the trust fund if the trustee had paid the plaintiff's claim.

4. The trustee may also be held personally liable for any tort committed by him or her, or by his or her agents or employees in the course of their employments only if, and to the extent that, damages for the tort are not collectible from trust property as provided in and pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

5. The procedure for all actions provided in this section is as provided in RCW 11.96A.080 through 11.96A.200.

6. Nothing in this section shall be construed to change the existing law with regard to the liability of the trustee of a charitable trust for the torts of the trustee.

No provision of an instrument creating a trust, including the provisions of any further trust created, and no other disposition of property made pursuant to exercise of a power of appointment granted in or created through authority under such instrument is invalid under the rule against perpetuities, or any similar statute or common law, during the one hundred fifty years following the effective date of the instrument.

Thereafter, unless the trust assets have previously become distributable or vested, the provision or other disposition of property is deemed to have been rendered invalid under the rule against perpetuities.

## 11.98.170 - Designation of trustee as beneficiary of life insurance policy or retirement plan—Determination of proper recipient of proceeds—Definitions—Beneficiary designations executed before January 1, 1985, not invalidated.
1. Any life insurance policy or retirement plan payment provision may designate as beneficiary:

   a. A trustee named or to be named by will, and immediately after the proving of the will, the proceeds of such insurance or of such plan designated as payable to that trustee, in part or in whole, shall be paid to the trustee in accordance with the beneficiary designation, to be held and disposed of under the terms of the will governing the testamentary trust; or

   b. A trustee named or to be named under a trust agreement executed by the insured, the plan participant, or any other person, and the proceeds of such insurance or retirement plan designated as payable to such trustee, in part or in whole, shall be paid to the trustee in accordance with the beneficiary designation, to be held and disposed of by the trustee as provided in such trust agreement; a trust is valid even if the only corpus consists of the right of the trustee to receive as beneficiary insurance or retirement plan proceeds; any such trustee may also receive assets, other than insurance or retirement plan proceeds, by testamentary disposition or otherwise and, unless directed otherwise by the transferor of the assets, shall administer all property of the trust according to the terms of the trust agreement.

2. If no qualified trustee makes claim to the insurance policy or retirement plan proceeds from the insurance company or the plan administrator within twelve months after the death of the insured or plan participant, determination of the proper recipient of the proceeds shall be made pursuant to the judicial or nonjudicial dispute resolution procedures of chapter 11.96A RCW, unless prior to the institution of the judicial procedures, a qualified trustee makes claim to the proceeds, except that (a) if satisfactory evidence is furnished the insurance company or plan administrator within the twelve-month period showing that no trustee can or will qualify to receive such proceeds, payment shall be made to those otherwise entitled to the proceeds under the terms of the policy or retirement plan, including the terms of the beneficiary designation except that (b) if there is any dispute as to the proper recipient of insurance policy or retirement plan proceeds, the dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the judicial or nonjudicial resolution procedures in chapter 11.96A RCW.

3. The proceeds of the insurance or retirement plan as collected by the trustee are not subject to debts of the insured or the plan participant to any greater extent than if the proceeds were payable to any named beneficiary other than the personal representative or the estate of the insured or of the plan participant.

4. For purposes of this section the following definitions apply:

   a. "Plan administrator" means the person upon whom claim must be made in order for retirement plan proceeds to be paid upon the death of the plan participant.

   b. "Retirement plan" means any plan, account, deposit, annuity, or benefit, other than a life insurance policy, that provides for payment to a beneficiary designated by the plan participant for whom the plan is established. The term includes, without limitation, such plans regardless of source of funding, and, for example, includes pensions, annuities, stock bonus plans, employee stock ownership plans, profit sharing plans, self-employed retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, individual retirement annuities, and retirement bonds, as well as any other retirement plan or program.

   c. "Trustee" includes any custodian under chapter 11.114 RCW or any similar statutory provisions of any other state and the terms "trust agreement" and "will" refer to the provisions of chapter 11.114 RCW or such similar statutory provisions of any other state.

5. Enactment of this section does not invalidate life insurance policy or retirement plan beneficiary designations executed prior to January 1, 1985, naming a trustee established by will or by trust agreement.

## 11.98.200 - Beneficiary trustee—Limitations on power.
Due to the inherent conflict of interest that exists between a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust, unless the terms of a trust refer specifically to RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 and provide expressly to the contrary, the powers conferred upon a trustee who is a beneficiary of the trust, other than the trustor as a trustee, cannot be exercised by the trustee to make:

1. Discretionary distributions of either principal or income to or for the benefit of the trustee, except to provide for the trustee's health, education, maintenance, or support as described under section 2041 or 2514 of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable regulations adopted under that section;

2. Discretionary allocations of receipts or expenses as between principal and income, unless the trustee acts in a fiduciary capacity whereby the trustee has no power to enlarge or shift a beneficial interest except as an incidental consequence of the discharge of the trustee's fiduciary duties; or

3. Discretionary distributions of either principal or income to satisfy a legal obligation of the trustee.

A proscribed power under this section that is conferred upon two or more trustees may be exercised by the trustees that are not disqualified under this section. If there is no trustee qualified to exercise a power proscribed under this section, a person described in RCW 11.96A.080 who is entitled to seek judicial proceedings with respect to a trust may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint another trustee who would not be disqualified, and the power may be exercised by another trustee appointed by the court. Alternatively, another trustee who would not be disqualified may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the trust instrument if the procedures are provided, or as set forth in RCW 11.98.039 as if the office of trustee were vacant, or by a nonjudicial dispute resolution agreement under RCW 11.96A.220.

## 11.98.210 - Beneficiary trustee—Disregard of provision conferring absolute or similar power—Power of removal.
If a trustee is a beneficiary of the trust and the trust instrument confers the power to make distributions of principal or income for the trustee's health, education, support, or maintenance as described in section 2041 or 2514 of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable regulations adopted under that section, then a trust provision purporting to confer "absolute," "sole," "complete," "conclusive," or a similar discretion relating to the exercise of such trustee powers shall be disregarded in the exercise of the power, and the power may then only be exercised reasonably and in accordance with the ascertainable standard as set forth in RCW 11.98.200 and this section. A person who has the right to remove or to replace a trustee does not possess nor may the person be deemed to possess by virtue of having that right the powers of the trustee who is subject to removal or replacement.

\[ [1993 c 339 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5066-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20339%20§%203); \]

## 11.98.220 - Beneficiary trustee—Inferences of law—Judicial review.
RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 do not raise any inference that the law of this state prior to July 25, 1993, was different than under RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240. Further, RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 do not raise an inference that prior to July 25, 1993, a trustee's exercise or failure to exercise a power described in RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 was not subject to review by a court of competent jurisdiction for abuse of discretion or breach of fiduciary duty under chapter 11.96A RCW or other applicable law. Following July 25, 1993, the power of judicial review continues to apply.

## 11.98.230 - Beneficiary trustee—Income under marital deduction—Spousal power of appointment.
Notwithstanding any provision of RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 seemingly to the contrary, RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 do not limit or restrict the distribution of income of a trust that qualifies or that otherwise could have qualified for the marital deduction under section 2056 or 2523 of the Internal Revenue Code, those Internal Revenue Code sections requiring that all income be distributed to the spouse of the decedent or of the trustor at least annually, whether or not an election was in fact made under section 2056(b)(7) or 2523(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 do not limit or restrict the power of a spouse of the trustor or the spouse of the decedent to exercise a power of appointment described in section 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to that portion of the trust that could otherwise qualify for the marital deduction under either of those Internal Revenue Code sections.

However, except for RCW 11.98.200(3), the 1994 c 221 amendments to RCW 11.98.200 apply to a trust established under a will, codicil, trust agreement, declaration of trust, deed, or other instrument executed after January 1, 1995, unless the instrument's terms refer specifically to RCW 11.98.200 and provide expressly to the contrary.

          C.  A person entitled to judicial proceedings for a declaration of rights or legal relations under RCW 11.96A.080 obtains a judicial determination that the application of this subsection (1)(a)(ii) to the trust is inconsistent with the provisions or purposes of the will or trust.

   b. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, RCW 11.98.200 and 11.98.210 respectively apply to a trust established under a will or codicil of a decedent dying on or after July 25, 1993, and to an inter vivos trust to which the trustor had on or after July 25, 1993, the power to terminate, revoke, amend, or modify, unless:

      ii. The decedent or the trustor was not competent, on July 25, 1993, to change the disposition of his or her property, or to terminate, revoke, amend, or modify the trust, and did not regain his or her competence to dispose, terminate, revoke, amend, or modify before the date of the decedent's death or before the trust could not otherwise be revoked, terminated, amended, or modified by the decedent or trustor.

2. RCW 11.98.200 neither creates a new cause of action nor impairs an existing cause of action that, in either case, relates to a power proscribed under RCW 11.98.200 that was exercised before July 25, 1993. RCW 11.98.210 neither creates a new cause of action nor impairs an existing cause of action that, in either case, relates to a power proscribed, limited, or qualified under RCW 11.98.210.

3. For the purpose of subsection (1)(a)(ii) of this section, "parties in interest" means those persons identified as "parties" under *RCW 11.96A.030(4).
