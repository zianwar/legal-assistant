\[ [2021 c 140 § 3304](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%203304); \]

## 11.95A.240 - Permissible appointment.
1.

2. A powerholder of a general power of appointment that permits appointment only to the creditors of the powerholder or of the powerholder's estate may appoint only to those creditors.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 3307](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%203307); \]

## 11.95A.270 - Selective allocation doctrine.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 3308](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%203308); \]

## 11.95A.280 - Capture doctrine—Disposition of ineffectively appointed property under general power.
To the extent a powerholder of a general power of appointment, other than a power to withdraw property from, revoke, or amend a trust, makes an ineffective appointment:

2. If there is no gift-in-default clause or to the extent the clause is ineffective, the ineffectively appointed property:

   a. Passes to:

      i. The powerholder if the powerholder is a permissible appointee and living; or

      ii. If the powerholder is an impermissible appointee or deceased, the powerholder's estate if the estate is a permissible appointee; or

   b. If there is no taker under (a) of this subsection, passes under a reversionary interest to the donor or the donor's transferee or successor in interest.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 3309](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%203309); \]

To the extent a powerholder releases or fails to exercise a general power of appointment other than a power to withdraw property from, revoke, or amend a trust:

1. The gift-in-default clause controls the disposition of the unappointed property; or

2. If there is no gift-in-default clause or to the extent the clause is ineffective:

   a. Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection, the unappointed property passes to:

      i. The powerholder if the powerholder is a permissible appointee and living; or

      ii. If the powerholder is an impermissible appointee or deceased, the powerholder's estate if the estate is a permissible appointee; or

   b. To the extent the powerholder released the power, or if there is no taker under (a) of this subsection, the unappointed property passes under a reversionary interest to the donor or the donor's transferee or successor in interest.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 3310](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%203310); \]

## 11.95A.300 - Disposition of unappointed property—Released or unexercised nongeneral power.
To the extent a powerholder releases, ineffectively exercises, or fails to exercise a nongeneral power of appointment:

1. The gift-in-default clause controls the disposition of the unappointed property; or

2. If there is no gift-in-default clause or to the extent the clause is ineffective, the unappointed property:

   a. Passes to the permissible appointees if:

      i. The permissible appointees are defined and limited; and

      ii. The terms of the instrument creating the power do not manifest a contrary intent; or

   b. If there is no taker under (a) of this subsection, passes under a reversionary interest to the donor or the donor's transferee or successor in interest.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 3311](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%203311); \]

## 11.95A.310 - Disposition of unappointed property—Partial appointment to taker in default.
Unless the terms of the instrument creating or exercising a power of appointment manifest a contrary intent, if the powerholder makes a valid partial appointment to a taker in default of appointment, the taker in default of appointment may share fully in unappointed property.

\[ [2021 c 140 § 3312](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5132.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20140%20§%203312); \]

## 11.95A.320 - Appointment to taker in default.
If a powerholder makes an appointment to a taker in default of appointment and the appointee would have taken the property in the same manner and with the same conditions under a gift-in-default clause had the property not been appointed, the power of appointment is deemed not to have been exercised and the appointee takes under the clause.

A powerholder may revoke or amend an exercise of a power of appointment only to the extent that:

2. The terms of the instrument creating the power of appointment provide that the exercise is revocable or amendable.

## 11.95A.350 - Exercise of power in favor of holder—Limitations.
If the standard governing the exercise of a lifetime or a testamentary power of appointment does not clearly indicate that a broader or more restrictive power of appointment is intended, the holder of the power of appointment may exercise it in his or her favor only for his or her health, education, support, or maintenance as described in section 2041 or 2514 of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable regulations adopted under the section.

## 11.95A.355 - Exercise of power in favor of holder—Disregard of provision conferring absolute or similar power—Power of removal.
If the holder of a lifetime or testamentary power of appointment may exercise the power in his or her own favor only for his or her health, education, support, or maintenance as described in section 2041 or 2514 of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable regulations adopted under that section, then a provision of the instrument creating the power of appointment that purports to confer "absolute," "sole," "complete," "conclusive," or a similar discretion shall be disregarded in the exercise of that power in favor of the holder, and that power may then only be exercised reasonably and in accordance with the ascertainable standards set forth in RCW 11.95A.350 and this section. A person who has the right to remove or replace a trustee does not possess nor may the person be deemed to possess, by virtue of having that right, the power of the trustee who is subject to removal or to replacement.

Notwithstanding any provision of RCW 11.95A.350 through 11.95A.375 seemingly to the contrary, RCW 11.95A.350 through 11.95A.375 do not limit or restrict the distribution of income of a trust that qualifies or that otherwise could have qualified for the marital deduction under section 2056 or 2523 of the Internal Revenue Code, those Internal Revenue Code sections requiring that all income be distributed to the spouse of the decedent or of the trustor at least annually, whether or not an election was in fact made under section 2056(b)(7) or 2523(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, RCW 11.95A.350 through 11.95A.375 do not limit or restrict the power of a spouse of the trustor or the spouse of the decedent to exercise a power of appointment described in section 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to that portion of the trust that could otherwise qualify for the marital deduction under either of those Internal Revenue Code sections.

RCW 11.95A.350 through 11.95A.375 do not raise an inference that the law of this state prior to July 25, 1993, was different than contained in RCW 11.95A.350 through 11.95A.375.
