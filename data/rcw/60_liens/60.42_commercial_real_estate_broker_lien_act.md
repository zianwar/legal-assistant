## 60.42.005 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Commercial real estate" means a fee title interest or possessory estate in real property located in this state except an interest in real property which is (a) improved with one single-family residential unit or one multifamily structure with four or less residential units, or (b) unimproved and the maximum permitted development is one to four residential units or structures under the county or city zoning ordinances or comprehensive plan applicable to that real estate, or (c) classified as farm and agricultural land or timberland for assessment purposes pursuant to chapter 84.34 RCW, or (d) improved with single-family residential units such as condominiums, townhouses, timeshares, or stand-alone houses in a subdivision that may be legally sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of on a unit-by-unit basis. Real estate will be considered commercial real estate if the commission agreement so provides, or if it meets the definition contained in this section on the date of the disposition.

2. "Commission agreement" means a written instrument which meets the requirements of RCW 19.36.010 signed by the owner, or by a party duly authorized to sign on behalf of the owner, of commercial real estate, pursuant to which the owner agrees to pay a broker a real estate commission upon either the disposition or lease of commercial real estate or upon entering into an agreement for disposition or lease of commercial real estate. When a broker and owner execute multiple versions of a commission agreement regarding the same disposition of commercial real estate, the final written version of the commission agreement, which incorporates the final agreement between the broker and the owner, constitutes the "commission agreement" and shall be used to determine the amount of the lien created by this chapter.

3. "Days" means calendar days. However, if a period ends on a day other than a business day, then the last day shall be the next business day.

4. "Disposition" means a voluntary transfer or conveyance of commercial real estate.

5. "Escrow closing agent" means the person or entity who receives documents and funds for recording and disbursement in completing a transaction for the disposition of commercial real estate.

6. "Lease" means a written agreement which gives rise to a relationship of landlord and tenant, affecting commercial real estate, such that the holder of a fee simple interest or possessory estate in commercial real estate permits another to possess the commercial real estate for a period, and which meets the requirements of RCW 19.36.010, if applicable.

7. "Net rental proceeds" means the base rent paid by the tenant under a lease, less any amounts currently due under the terms of liens which have priority over the lien created under this chapter. Base rent is the rent so designated in a lease as base rent, or a similar term, for the possession and use of the commercial real estate, but does not include separate payments made by tenants for insurance, taxes, utilities, or other expenses.

8. "Owner" means a person or entity which is vested in record fee title or a possessory estate in commercial real estate.

9. [Empty]

   a. "Owner's net proceeds" means the gross sales proceeds from the disposition of the commercial real estate described in a notice of claim of lien against proceeds pursuant to this chapter, less the following: (i) Amounts necessary to pay all encumbrances and liens which have priority over the lien created by this chapter other than those permitted to remain by the buyer; (ii) owner's closing costs, such as real estate excise tax, title insurance premiums, real estate tax and assessment prorations, and escrow fees payable by the owner pursuant to an agreement with the buyer; and (iii) amounts held by a third party for use by the owner to complete an exchange of real estate which is deferred from federal income tax under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.

   b. "Owner's net proceeds" shall include any gross sales proceeds which are held by a third party for purposes of completing an exchange of real estate which is deferred from federal income tax under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, but are subsequently not used for that purpose. "Owner's net proceeds" are personal property, upon which the lien created by this chapter attaches.

10. "Real estate broker" or "broker" means the same as defined in *RCW 18.85.010.

11. "Real property" means one or more parcels or tracts of land, including appurtenances or improvements.

## 60.42.010 - Lien upon personal property—Effective date—Notice of claim of lien—Waiver of lien rights—Court costs, attorneys' fees, and statutory interest.
1. The lien created under this chapter is a lien upon personal property, not upon real property.

2. A broker has a lien upon the owner's net proceeds from the disposition of commercial real estate and a lien upon the net rental proceeds from the lease of commercial real estate in the amount which the owner has agreed to pay the broker under a commission agreement. The lien under this chapter is available only to the broker named in the commission agreement, and may not be assigned voluntarily or by operation of law.

3. Subject to the requirements of subsection (4) of this section, the lien created by this chapter becomes effective on the date of the recording of a notice of claim of lien upon proceeds pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, and is perfected by such recording. Recording must be made with the county auditor or recorder in the county or counties in which the commercial real estate is located.

4. In the case of a disposition of commercial real estate, the lien under this chapter is not effective unless it is recorded at least thirty days prior to the date a deed conveying the commercial real estate is recorded in the office of the county auditor or recorder in the county or counties in which the commercial real estate is located. In the case of a lease of commercial real estate, the lien under this chapter is not effective unless it is recorded within ninety days after the tenant takes possession of the leased commercial real estate.

5. The lien created by this chapter is null and void unless, within ten days of recording its notice of claim of lien against proceeds, the broker delivers a copy of the notice of claim of lien against proceeds to the owner of the commercial real estate in the manner provided in RCW 60.42.070. In the case of the disposition of commercial real estate, on or before the date the deed conveying the commercial real estate is recorded, the broker shall deliver a copy of the notice of claim of lien against proceeds to the escrow closing agent closing the disposition in the manner provided in RCW 60.42.070, if the identity of the escrow closing agent is actually known by the broker.

6. To be effective, the notice of claim of lien against proceeds must state the following:

   a. The name, address, and telephone number of the broker;

   b. The date of the commission agreement;

   c. The name of the owner of the commercial real estate;

   d. The legal description of the commercial real estate as described in the commission agreement;

   e. The amount for which the lien is claimed, which may be stated in a dollar amount or may be stated in the form of a formula for how the amount is to be determined such as a percentage of the sales price;

   f. The real estate license number of the broker; and

   g. That the lien claimant has read the claim, knows the contents, and believes the same to be true and correct, and that the claim is made pursuant to a valid commission agreement, and is not frivolous, under penalties of perjury.

A copy of the commission agreement must be attached to the recorded notice of claim of lien against proceeds. The notice of claim of lien against proceeds must recite that the information contained in the notice of claim of lien against proceeds is true and accurate to the knowledge of the signatory. The notice of claim of lien against proceeds must be acknowledged pursuant to chapter 64.08 RCW. A notice of claim of lien against proceeds substantially in the following form is sufficient:

7. Whenever a notice of claim of lien against proceeds is recorded and a condition or event occurs, or fails to occur, that would preclude the broker from receiving compensation under the terms of the commission agreement, including the filing of a notice of claim of lien against proceeds in a manner which does not comply with this chapter, the broker shall record, within seven days following demand by the owner, a written release of the notice of claim of lien against proceeds.

8. Whenever the amount claimed in a notice of claim of lien against proceeds is paid to the lien claimant, the lien claimant shall promptly record a satisfaction or release of the notice of claim of lien against proceeds on written demand of the owner no later than five days after receipt of payment. In the case of a disposition of commercial real estate, the escrow closing agent is required to pay to the lien claimant the owner's net proceeds up to the amount claimed in the notice of claim of lien against proceeds. If the amount claimed in the notice of claim of lien against proceeds is to be fully or partially paid to the lien claimant by the escrow closing agent, upon such disposition, then the lien claimant shall submit a release of the notice of claim of lien against proceeds in the amount of the owner's net proceeds or the amount of the lien, whichever is smaller, to the escrow closing agent to be held in escrow pending such disposition and payment. In a suit brought by the owner to compel delivery of the release by the lien claimant, if the court determines that the delay was unjustified, the court shall, in addition to ordering the release of the notice of claim of lien, award the costs of the action including reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.

9. An owner of commercial real estate may request that a broker waive the rights to a lien under this chapter, and such a waiver contained in the commission agreement signed by the broker is effective to waive the broker's rights to a lien under this chapter. In a suit filed by a broker to recover amounts due under a commission agreement in which the broker has waived lien rights under this chapter, if the court finds that payment is due to the broker under the commission agreement, the court, in addition to awarding normal damages, shall award to the broker court costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and statutory interest, as provided in RCW 19.52.010, from the date the deed is recorded in the event of a disposition, or from the date the tenant takes possession in the event of a lease.

## 60.42.020 - Disputed claim—Order to show cause—Hearing.
1. An owner of commercial real estate subject to a recorded notice of claim of lien against proceeds under this chapter, who disputes the broker's claim in the notice of claim of lien against proceeds, may apply by motion to the superior court for the county where the commercial real estate, or some part thereof, is located for an order directing the broker to appear before the court at a time no earlier than seven nor later than fifteen days following the date of service of the motion and order on the broker, to show cause as to why the relief requested should not be granted. The motion must state the grounds upon which relief is asked and must be supported by the affidavit of the owner setting forth a concise statement of the facts upon which the motion is based.

2. The order to show cause must clearly state that if the broker fails to appear at the time and place noted, the notice of claim of lien against proceeds must be released, with prejudice, and the broker must be ordered to pay the costs requested by the owner, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

3. If, following a hearing on the matter, the court determines that the owner is not a party to an agreement which will result in the owner being obligated to pay to the broker a commission pursuant to the terms of a commission agreement, the court shall issue an order releasing the notice of claim of lien against proceeds and awarding costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the owner to be paid by the broker. If the court determines that the owner is a party to an agreement which will result in the owner being obligated to pay to the broker a commission pursuant to the terms of a commission agreement, the court shall issue an order so stating and awarding costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the broker, to be paid by the owner. Such orders are final judgments.

4. Proceedings under this section shall not affect other rights and remedies available to the parties under this chapter or otherwise.

\[ [1997 c 315 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1936-S.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20315%20§%203); \]

## 60.42.030 - Lien on net rental proceeds—Order to show cause—Hearing.
1. If a broker has a lien on net rental proceeds pursuant to RCW 60.42.010(2), and the broker has recorded a notice of claim of lien against proceeds and otherwise complied with the requirements of this chapter, the broker may apply by motion to the superior court for the county where the commercial real estate, or some part thereof, is located, for an order directing the owner to appear before the court at a time no earlier than seven nor later than fifteen days following the date of service of the motion and order on the owner, and show cause as to why the relief requested should not be granted. The motion must state the grounds upon which relief is asked, and must be supported by the affidavit of the broker setting forth a concise statement of the facts upon which the motion is based.

2. The order to show cause must clearly state that if the owner fails to appear at the time and place noted, the broker shall be entitled to an order enjoining the owner from paying the net rental proceeds from such lease to any party other than the broker, and that the owner shall be ordered to pay the costs requested by the broker, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

3. If, following a hearing on the matter, the court determines that the owner is, or was, a party to an agreement for the lease of commercial real estate, which did or will result in the owner being obligated to pay to the broker a commission pursuant to the terms of a commission agreement, the court shall issue an order enjoining the owner from paying the net rental proceeds from such lease to any party other than the broker. The court shall also order the owner to pay such net rental proceeds to the broker and award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the broker, to be paid by the owner. If the court determines that the owner is not, or was not, a party to an agreement for the lease of commercial real estate, which did or will result in the owner being obligated to pay to the broker a commission pursuant to the terms of a commission agreement, the court shall issue an order so stating and awarding costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the owner, to be paid by the broker. Such orders are final judgments.

4. Proceedings under this section shall not affect other rights and remedies available to the parties under this chapter or otherwise.

\[ [1997 c 315 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1936-S.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20315%20§%204); \]

## 60.42.040 - Priority of lien claims.
All statutory liens, consensual liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, assignments of rents, and other encumbrances, including all advances or charges made or accruing thereunder, whether voluntary or obligatory, and all modifications, extensions, renewals, and replacements thereof, recorded prior to the recording of a notice of claim of lien against proceeds have priority over a lien created under this chapter. A prior recorded lien includes, without limitation, a valid material supplier's or mechanic's lien claim that is recorded after the recording of the broker's notice of claim of lien against proceeds but which relates back to a date prior to the recording date of the broker's notice of claim of lien against proceeds.

## 60.42.050 - Deposit made pending resolution of amounts due—Recording of receipt—Release of notice of claim of lien.
A notice of claim of lien against proceeds recorded under this chapter must be released without further act, upon the recording of a receipt showing the deposit with the superior court of the county in which the commercial real estate, or some part thereof, is located, of an amount equal to one and one-quarter times the amount of the lien claimed. The receipt shall be recorded in the office in which the notice of claim was recorded. The amount of the deposit in the superior court shall be held pending a resolution of amounts due to the broker and the owner.

\[ [1997 c 315 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1936-S.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20315%20§%206); \]

## 60.42.060 - County auditor or recorder—Duties—Fees.
The county auditor or recorder shall record the notice of claim of lien against proceeds, and any release thereof, in the same manner as deeds and other instruments of title are recorded under chapter 65.08 RCW. Notices of claim of lien against proceeds for registered land need not be recorded in the Torrens register. The county auditor or recorder may not charge a higher fee for recording a notice of claim of lien against proceeds, or for a release thereof, than what the county auditor or recorder charges for other documents.

\[ [1997 c 315 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1936-S.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20315%20§%207); \]

Delivery is effective at the time of personal service, or personal or electronic delivery, or three days following deposit in the mail as required by this section. Notice to a broker or owner may be given to the address of the broker or owner that is contained in the commission agreement, or such other address as is contained in a written notice from the broker or owner to the party giving the notice. If no address is provided in the commission agreement, the notice to the broker may be given to the broker's address of record with the department of licensing pursuant to chapter 18.85 RCW and notice to the owner may be given to the address of the commercial real estate.
