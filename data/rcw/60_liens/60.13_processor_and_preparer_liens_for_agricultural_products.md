## 60.13.020 - Processor lien.
Starting on the date a producer delivers any agricultural product to a processor or conditioner, the producer has a first priority statutory lien, referred to as a "processor lien." A commercial fisher who delivers fish to a processor also has a first priority statutory "processor lien" starting on the date the fisher delivers fish to the processor. This processor lien shall continue until twenty days after payment for the product is due and remains unpaid, without filing any notice of lien, for the contract price, if any, or the fair market value of the products delivered. The processor lien attaches to the agricultural products or fish delivered, to the processor's or conditioner's inventory, and to the processor's or conditioner's accounts receivable. However, no processor lien may attach to agricultural products or fish delivered by a producer or commercial fisher, or on the producer's or fisher's behalf, to a processor which is organized and operated on a cooperative basis and of which the producer or fisher is a member, nor may such lien attach to such processor's inventory or accounts receivable.

## 60.13.030 - Preparer lien for grain, hay, or straw.
Starting on the date a producer delivers grain, hay, or straw to a preparer, the producer has a first priority statutory lien, referred to as a "preparer lien." This preparer lien shall continue twenty days after payment for the product is due and remains unpaid, without filing any notice of lien, for the contract price, if any, or the fair market value of the products delivered. The preparer lien attaches to the agricultural products delivered by the producer to the preparer, and to the preparer's accounts receivable.

The notice required herein shall contain the information described in RCW 60.13.040(2). If requested by the person responsible for payment of such amounts, the producer must seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the preparer lien continues to exist and unless such proof is so furnished, that person has no obligation to pay the producer. A preparer of dairy products shall provide the name of the purchaser or marketing agent of the products to the producer upon request.

Failure to furnish the written notice as provided in this section shall not affect the status of the lien established under this chapter in regard to the relationship with other creditors.

## 60.13.038 - Wine producer lien—First priority—Terms.

This wine producer lien shall continue, without filing notice of lien, until sixty days after payment for the product is due and remains unpaid, for the contract price, if any, or the fair market value of the products delivered.
