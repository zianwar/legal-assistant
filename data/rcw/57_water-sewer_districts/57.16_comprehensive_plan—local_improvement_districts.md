## 57.16.010 - General comprehensive plan of improvements—Approval of engineer, director of health, and city, town, or county—Amendments.
Before ordering any improvements or submitting to vote any proposition for incurring any indebtedness, the district commissioners shall adopt a general comprehensive plan for the type or types of facilities the district proposes to provide. A district may prepare a separate general comprehensive plan for each of these services and other services that districts are permitted to provide, or the district may combine any or all of its comprehensive plans into a single general comprehensive plan.

1. For a general comprehensive plan of a water supply system, the commissioners shall investigate the several portions and sections of the district for the purpose of determining the present and reasonably foreseeable future needs thereof; shall examine and investigate, determine, and select a water supply or water supplies for such district suitable and adequate for present and reasonably foreseeable future needs thereof; and shall consider and determine a general system or plan for acquiring such water supply or water supplies, and the lands, waters, and water rights and easements necessary therefor, and for retaining and storing any such waters, and erecting dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and pipe lines to convey the same throughout such district. There may be included as part of the system the installation of fire hydrants at suitable places throughout the district. The commissioners shall determine a general comprehensive plan for distributing such water throughout such portion of the district as may then reasonably be served by means of subsidiary aqueducts and pipe lines, and a long-term plan for financing the planned projects and the method of distributing the cost and expense thereof, including the creation of local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts, and shall determine whether the whole or part of the cost and expenses shall be paid from revenue or general obligation bonds.

2. For a general comprehensive plan for a sewer system, the commissioners shall investigate all portions and sections of the district and select a general comprehensive plan for a sewer system for the district suitable and adequate for present and reasonably foreseeable future needs thereof. The general comprehensive plan shall provide for treatment plants and other methods and services, if any, for the prevention, control, and reduction of water pollution and for the treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial and other liquid wastes now produced or which may reasonably be expected to be produced within the district and shall, for such portions of the district as may then reasonably be served, provide for the acquisition or construction and installation of laterals, trunk sewers, intercepting sewers, syphons, pumping stations or other sewage collection facilities, septic tanks, septic tank systems or drainfields, and systems for the transmission and treatment of wastewater. The general comprehensive plan shall provide a long-term plan for financing the planned projects and the method of distributing the cost and expense of the sewer system and services, including the creation of local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts; and provide whether the whole or some part of the cost and expenses shall be paid from revenue or general obligation bonds.

3. For a general comprehensive plan for a reclaimed water system, the commissioners shall investigate all portions and sections of the district and select a general comprehensive plan for a reclaimed water system for the district suitable and adequate for present and reasonably foreseeable future needs thereof. The general comprehensive plan must provide for treatment plants or the use of existing treatment plants and other methods and services, if any, for reclaiming water and must, for such portions of the district as may then reasonably be served, provide for a general system or plan for acquiring the lands and easements necessary therefor, including retaining and storing reclaimed water, and for the acquisition or construction and installation of mains, transmission mains, pumping stations, hydrants, or other facilities and systems for the reclamation and transmission of reclaimed water throughout such district for such uses, public and private, as authorized by law. The general comprehensive plan must provide a long-term plan for financing the planned projects and the method of distributing the cost and expense of the reclaimed water system and services, including the creation of local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts; and provide whether the whole or some part of the cost and expenses must be paid from revenue or general obligation bonds.

4. For a general comprehensive plan for a drainage system, the commissioners shall investigate all portions and sections of the district and adopt a general comprehensive plan for a drainage system for the district suitable and adequate for present and future needs thereof. The general comprehensive plan shall provide for a system to collect, treat, and dispose of stormwater or surface waters, including use of natural systems and the construction or provision of culverts, stormwater pipes, ponds, and other systems. The general comprehensive plan shall provide for a long-term plan for financing the planned projects and provide for a method of distributing the cost and expense of the drainage system, including local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts, and provide whether the whole or some part of the cost and expenses shall be paid from revenue or general obligation bonds.

5. For a general comprehensive plan for street lighting, the commissioners shall investigate all portions and sections of the district and adopt a general comprehensive plan for street lighting for the district suitable and adequate for present and future needs thereof. The general comprehensive plan shall provide for a system or systems of street lighting, provide for a long-term plan for financing the planned projects, and provide for a method of distributing the cost and expense of the street lighting system, including local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts, and provide whether the whole or some part of the cost and expenses shall be paid from revenue or general obligation bonds.

6. The commissioners may employ such engineering and legal service as in their discretion is necessary in carrying out their duties.

7. Any general comprehensive plan or plans shall be adopted by resolution and submitted to an engineer designated by the legislative authority of the county in which fifty-one percent or more of the area of the district is located, and to the director of health of the county in which the district or any portion thereof is located, and must be approved in writing by the engineer and director of health, except that a comprehensive plan relating to street lighting shall not be submitted to or approved by the director of health. The general comprehensive plan shall be approved, conditionally approved, or rejected by the director of health and by the designated engineer within sixty days of their respective receipt of the plan. However, this sixty-day time limitation may be extended by the director of health or engineer for up to an additional sixty days if sufficient time is not available to review adequately the general comprehensive plans.

Before becoming effective, the general comprehensive plan shall also be submitted to, and approved by resolution of, the legislative authority of every county within whose boundaries all or a portion of the district lies. The general comprehensive plan shall be approved, conditionally approved, or rejected by each of the county legislative authorities pursuant to the criteria in RCW 57.02.040 for approving the formation, reorganization, annexation, consolidation, or merger of districts. The resolution, ordinance, or motion of the legislative body that rejects the comprehensive plan or a part thereof shall specifically state in what particular the comprehensive plan or part thereof rejected fails to meet these criteria. The general comprehensive plan shall not provide for the extension or location of facilities that are inconsistent with the requirements of RCW 36.70A.110. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a county from rejecting a proposed plan because it is in conflict with the criteria in RCW 57.02.040. Each general comprehensive plan shall be deemed approved if the county legislative authority fails to reject or conditionally approve the plan within ninety days of the plan's submission to the county legislative authority or within thirty days of a hearing on the plan when the hearing is held within ninety days of submission to the county legislative authority. However, a county legislative authority may extend this ninety-day time limitation by up to an additional ninety days where a finding is made that ninety days is insufficient to review adequately the general comprehensive plan. In addition, the commissioners and the county legislative authority may mutually agree to an extension of the deadlines in this section.

If the district includes portions or all of one or more cities or towns, the general comprehensive plan shall be submitted also to, and approved by resolution of, the legislative authorities of the cities and towns before becoming effective. The general comprehensive plan shall be deemed approved by the city or town legislative authority if the city or town legislative authority fails to reject or conditionally approve the plan within ninety days of the plan's submission to the city or town or within thirty days of a hearing on the plan when the hearing is held within ninety days of submission to the county legislative authority. However, a city or town legislative authority may extend this time limitation by up to an additional ninety days where a finding is made that insufficient time exists to adequately review the general comprehensive plan within these time limitations. In addition, the commissioners and the city or town legislative authority may mutually agree to an extension of the deadlines in this section.

Before becoming effective, the general comprehensive plan shall be approved by any state agency whose approval may be required by applicable law. Before becoming effective, any amendment to, alteration of, or addition to, a general comprehensive plan shall also be subject to such approval as if it were a new general comprehensive plan. However, only if the amendment, alteration, or addition affects a particular city or town, shall the amendment, alteration, or addition be subject to approval by such particular city or town governing body.

## 57.16.060 - Resolution or petition to form district—Procedure—Written protest—Notice.
Local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts to carry out the whole or any portion of the general comprehensive plan of improvements or plan providing for additions and betterments to an original general comprehensive plan previously adopted may be initiated either by resolution of the board of commissioners or by petition signed by the owners according to the records of the office of the applicable county auditor of at least fifty-one percent of the area of the land within the limits of the improvement district to be created.

In case the board of commissioners desires to initiate the formation of an improvement district by resolution, it first shall pass a resolution declaring its intention to order the improvement, setting forth the nature and territorial extent of such proposed improvement, designating the number of the proposed improvement district, and describing the boundaries thereof, stating the estimated cost and expense of the improvement and the proportionate amount thereof which will be borne by the property within the proposed improvement district, and fixing a date, time, and place for a public hearing on the formation of the proposed improvement district.

In case any such improvement district is initiated by petition, the petition shall set forth the nature and territorial extent of the proposed improvement requested to be ordered and the fact that the signers thereof are the owners according to the records of the applicable county auditor of at least fifty-one percent of the area of land within the limits of the improvement district to be created. Upon the filing of such petition the board shall determine whether the petition is sufficient, and the board's determination thereof shall be conclusive upon all persons. No person may withdraw his or her name from the petition after it has been filed with the board of commissioners. If the board finds the petition to be sufficient, it shall proceed to adopt a resolution declaring its intention to order the improvement petitioned for, setting forth the nature and territorial extent of the improvement, designating the number of the proposed improvement district and describing the boundaries thereof, stating the estimated cost and expense of the improvement and the proportionate amount thereof which will be borne by the property within the proposed improvement district, and fixing a date, time, and place for a public hearing on the formation of the proposed improvement district.

## 57.16.062 - Hearing—Improvement ordered—Divestment of power to order—Notice—Appeal—Assessment roll.
Whether an improvement district is initiated by petition or resolution, the board shall conduct a public hearing at the time and place designated in the notice to property owners. At this hearing the board shall hear objections from any person affected by the formation of the improvement district and may make such changes in the boundaries of the improvement district or such modifications in the plans for the proposed improvement as shall be deemed necessary. The board may not change the boundaries of the improvement district to include property not previously included in it without first passing a new resolution of intention and giving a new notice to property owners in the manner and form and within the time provided in this chapter for the original notice.

After the hearing and the expiration of the ten-day period for filing protests, the commissioners shall have jurisdiction to overrule protests and proceed with any such improvement district initiated by petition or resolution. The jurisdiction of the commissioners to proceed with any improvement district initiated by resolution shall be divested by protests filed with the secretary of the board within ten days after the public hearing, signed by the owners, according to the records of the applicable county auditor, of at least forty percent of the area of land within the proposed improvement district.

If the commissioners find that the improvement district should be formed, they shall by resolution form the improvement district and order the improvement. After execution of the resolution forming the improvement district, the secretary of the board of commissioners shall publish, in a legal publication that serves the area subject to the improvement district, a notice setting forth that a resolution has been passed forming the improvement district and that a lawsuit challenging the jurisdiction or authority of the district to proceed with the improvement and creating the improvement district must be filed, and notice to the district served, within thirty days of the publication of the notice. The notice shall set forth the nature of the appeal. Property owners bringing the appeal shall follow the procedures set forth under RCW 57.16.090. Whenever a resolution forming an improvement district has been adopted, the formation is conclusive in all things upon all parties, and cannot be contested or questioned in any manner in any proceeding whatsoever by any person not commencing a lawsuit in the manner and within the time provided in this section, except for lawsuits made under RCW 57.16.090.

## 57.16.090 - Review.
The decision of the district board of commissioners upon any objections made within the time and in the manner herein prescribed may be reviewed by the superior court upon an appeal thereto taken in the following manner. The appeal shall be made by filing written notice of appeal with the secretary of the board of commissioners and with the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the real property is situated within ten days after publication of a notice that the resolution confirming such assessment roll has been adopted, and such notice of appeal shall describe the property and set forth the objections of such appellant to such assessment. Within ten days from the filing of such notice of appeal with the clerk of the superior court, the appellant shall file with the clerk of the court a transcript consisting of the assessment roll and the appellant's objections thereto, together with the resolution confirming the assessment roll and the record of the district commissioners with reference to the assessment. The transcript, upon payment of the necessary fees therefor, shall be furnished by the secretary of the board of commissioners and shall be certified by the secretary to contain full, true, and correct copies of all matters and proceedings required to be included in such transcript. Such fees shall be the same as the fees payable to the county clerk for the preparation and certification of transcripts on appeal to the supreme court or the court of appeals in civil actions. At the time of the filing of the notice of appeal with the clerk of the superior court, the appellant shall file a sufficient bond in the penal sum of two hundred dollars, with at least two sureties, to be approved by the judge of the court, conditioned to prosecute such appeal without delay, and if unsuccessful to pay all costs to which the district is put by reason of such appeal. The court may order the appellant, upon application therefor, to execute and file such additional bond or bonds as the necessity of the case may require. Within three days after such transcript is filed in the superior court, the appellant shall give written notice to the secretary of the district that such transcript is filed. The notice shall state a time, not less than three days from the service thereof, when the appellant will call up the cause for hearing. The superior court shall, at such time or at such further time as may be fixed by order of the court, hear and determine such appeal without a jury. The appeal shall have preference over all civil causes pending in the court, except eminent domain proceedings and actions of forcible entry and detainer. The judgment of the court shall confirm, unless the court shall find from the evidence that such assessment is either founded upon a fundamentally wrong basis or a decision of the board of commissioners thereon was arbitrary or capricious, or both, in which event the judgment of the court shall correct, modify, or annul the assessment insofar as it affects the property of the appellant. A certified copy of the decision of the court shall be filed with the officer who shall have custody of the assessment roll, who shall modify and correct the assessment roll in accordance with such decision. Appellate review of the judgment of the superior court may be sought as in other civil cases. However, the appeal must be sought within fifteen days after the date of the entry of the judgment of such superior court. A certified copy of the order of the supreme court or the court of appeals upon such appeal shall be filed with the officer having custody of the assessment roll, who shall thereupon modify and correct the assessment roll in accordance with the decision.

## 57.16.100 - Conclusiveness of roll—Correction of errors.
1. Whenever any assessment roll for local improvements shall have been confirmed by the district board of commissioners, the regularity, validity, and correctness of the proceedings relating to the improvements, and to the assessment therefor, including the action of the district commissioners upon the assessment roll and the confirmation thereof, shall be conclusive in all things upon all parties, and cannot in any manner be contested or questioned in any proceeding whatsoever by any person not filing written objections to such roll in the manner and within the time provided in this chapter, and not appealing from the action of the commissioners in confirming such assessment roll in the manner and within the time in this chapter provided. No proceedings of any kind shall be commenced or prosecuted for the purpose of defeating or contesting any such assessment, or the sale of property to pay such assessment, or any certificate of delinquency issued therefor, or the foreclosure of any lien issued therefor. However, this section shall not be construed as prohibiting the bringing of injunction proceedings to prevent the sale of any real estate upon the grounds (a) that the property about to be sold does not appear upon the assessment roll, or (b) that the assessment had been paid.

2. This section also shall not prohibit the correction of clerical errors and errors in the computation of assessments in assessment rolls by the following procedure:

   a. The board of commissioners may file a petition with the superior court of the county wherein the real property is located, asking that the court enter an order correcting such errors and directing that the county treasurer pay a portion or all of the incorrect assessment by the transfer of funds from the district's maintenance fund, if such relief be necessary.

   b. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall set a date for hearing and upon the hearing may enter an order as provided in (a) of this subsection. However, neither the correcting order nor the corrected assessment roll shall result in an increased assessment to the property owner.

Whenever any land against which there has been levied any special assessment by any district shall have been sold in part or divided, the board of commissioners of the district shall have the power to order a segregation of the assessment.

Any person desiring to have a special assessment against a tract of land segregated to apply to smaller parts thereof shall apply to the board of commissioners of the district that levied the assessment. If the commissioners determine that a segregation should be made, they shall by resolution order the treasurer of the county in which the real property is located to make segregation on the original assessment roll as directed in the resolution. The segregation shall be made as nearly as possible on the same basis as the original assessment was levied, and the total of the segregated parts of the assessment shall equal the assessment before segregation. The resolution shall describe the original tract and the amount and date of the original assessment, and shall define the boundaries of the divided parts and the amount of the assessment chargeable to each part. A certified copy of the resolution shall be delivered to the treasurer of the county in which the real property is located who shall proceed to make the segregation. The board of commissioners may require as a condition to the order of segregation that the person seeking it pay the district the reasonable engineering and clerical costs incident to making the segregation.
