If an applicant or licensee fails to correct the deficiency, the department shall deny or cancel the license. If aggrieved by the decision, the applicant or licensee may request a hearing as authorized under chapter 34.05 RCW.

7. Notwithstanding the payment of a late renewal fee, it is a violation to distribute a commercial feed by an unlicensed person, and nothing in this chapter prevents the department from imposing a penalty authorized by this chapter for the violation.

8. The department may under conditions specified by rule, request submission of labels and labeling in order to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

6.
