This chapter may be known and cited as the Washington state milk pooling act to provide for equitable pricing and pooling among producers and processors of milk and milk products.

\[ [1993 c 345 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5263-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20345%20§%201); [1971 ex.s. c 230 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c230.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20230%20§%201); \]

## 15.35.030 - Declaration of public interest.
It is hereby declared that:

1. Milk is a necessary article of food for human consumption;

2. The production, distribution, and maintenance of an adequate supply of healthful milk of proper chemical and physical content, free from contamination, is vital to the public health and welfare;

3. It is the policy of the state to promote, foster, and encourage the intelligent production and orderly marketing of adequate supplies of pure and wholesome milk and milk products necessary to its citizens, to promote competitive prices, and to eliminate economic waste, destructive trade practices, and improper accounting for milk purchased from producers;

4. Economic factors concerning the production, marketing, and sale of milk in the state may not be accurately reflected in federal programs;

5. Conditions within the milk industry of this state are such that it may be necessary to establish marketing areas wherein pricing and pooling arrangements between producers are necessary, and for that purpose the director shall have the administrative authority, with such additional duties as are herein prescribed, after investigations and public hearings, to prescribe such marketing areas and modify the same when advisable or necessary.

\[ [1993 c 345 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5263-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20345%20§%202); [1991 c 239 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5476.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20239%20§%201); [1971 ex.s. c 230 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c230.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20230%20§%203); \]

## 15.35.060 - Purposes.
The purposes of this chapter are to:

1. Authorize and enable the director to prescribe marketing areas and to establish pricing and pooling arrangements which are necessary to prevent disorderly marketing of milk due to varying factors of costs of production, health regulations, transportation, and other factors in said marketing areas of this state;

2. Authorize and enable the director to formulate marketing plans subject to the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, which provide for pricing and pooling arrangements and declare such plans in effect for any marketing area;

3. Provide funds for administration and enforcement of this chapter by assessments to be paid by producers.

\[ [1993 c 345 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5263-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20345%20§%203); [1991 c 239 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5476.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20239%20§%202); [1971 ex.s. c 230 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c230.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20230%20§%206); \]

## 15.35.070 - Powers conferred to be liberally construed—Monopoly—Price setting.
It is the intent of the legislature that the powers conferred in this chapter shall be liberally construed. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as permitting or authorizing the development of conditions of monopoly in the production or distribution of milk, nor shall this chapter give the director authority to establish wholesale or retail prices for processed milk products.

\[ [1993 c 345 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5263-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20345%20§%205); [1991 c 239 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5476.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20239%20§%203); [1971 ex.s. c 230 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c230.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20230%20§%207); \]

## 15.35.105 - Minimum milk price—Competition from outside the marketing area.
1. In establishing a minimum milk price or a formula to determine a minimum milk price, as provided under RCW 15.35.060 and 15.35.100, the director shall, in addition to other appropriate criteria, consider the:

   a. Cost of producing fluid milk for human consumption;

   b. Transportation costs;

   c. Milk prices in states or regions outside of the state that influence prices within the marketing areas;

   d. Demand for fluid milk for human consumption;

   e. Alternative enterprises available to producers; and

   f. Economic impact on milk dealers.

2. A milk dealer who believes that actual competition from outside the marketing area is having a significant economic impact on that milk dealer, may petition the director for a public hearing on an expedited basis to consider whether the minimum milk price in the market plan should be changed relative to the milk price to a competitor located outside the state plus transportation costs for that competitor to compete with the petitioning milk dealer.

   a. To be considered, the petition must identify the specific action requested, and must be accompanied by a statement summarizing the facts and evidence that would be provided at a public hearing by or on behalf of the petitioner to support the need for the requested action, including an identification of circumstances that have changed since the last rule-making proceeding at which the minimum price was established.

   b. Within twenty-one days of receiving the petition, the director shall either:

      i. Adopt rules on an emergency basis, in accordance with RCW 34.05.350;

      ii. File, and distribute to all milk dealers and other interested parties, notice that a hearing will be held within sixty days of receiving the petition;

      iii. Advise the petitioner in writing that the request for rule making is denied, and explain the reasons for the denial; or

      iv. Advise the petitioner in writing that the petition provides insufficient information from which to find that rule making should be initiated, and request that the petition be resubmitted with additional information.

   c. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, this petition must be handled in accordance with RCW 34.05.330, and the rule-making procedures of chapter 34.05 RCW.

3. The director may adopt rules of practice or procedure with respect to the proceedings.

\[ [1993 c 345 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5263-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20345%20§%207); [1991 c 239 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5476.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20239%20§%207); \]

## 15.35.110 - Referendum on establishing or discontinuing market area pooling arrangement.
1. The director, either upon his or her own motion or upon petition by ten percent of the producers in any proposed area, shall conduct a hearing to determine whether to establish or discontinue a market area pooling arrangement. Upon determination by the director that in order to satisfy the purposes of this chapter a pooling arrangement should be established, a referendum of affected individual producers and milk dealers shall be conducted by the department.

2. In order for the director to establish a market area and pooling plan:

   a. Sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the producers and producer-dealers that vote must be in favor of establishing a market area and pooling plan; 

   b. Sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the milk dealers and producer-dealers that vote must be in favor of establishing a market area and pooling plan; and

   c. Producer-dealers providing notice to the director under RCW 15.35.115(1), shall be authorized to vote both as producers and as milk dealers.

3. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the director, within ninety days from the date the results of a referendum approved under subsection (2) of this section are filed with the secretary of state, shall adopt rules to establish a market pool in the market area, as provided for in this chapter. In conducting hearings on rules proposed for adoption under this subsection, the director shall invite public comment on whether milk regulation similar to the market area pooling plan proposed in the rules exists in neighboring states and whether a lack of such milk regulation in neighboring states would render such a market area pooling plan in this state ineffective or impractical.

4. If, following hearings held under subsection (3) of this section, the director determines that the lack of milk regulation in neighboring states similar to the market area pooling plan proposed for this state would render such a pooling arrangement in this state ineffective or impractical, the director shall so state in writing. The director shall file the statement with the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register. In such a case, a market area pooling plan shall not be established in the market area under subsection (3) of this section based upon the referendum that precipitated the hearings.

If the director determines that such a lack of milk regulation in neighboring states would not render such a market area pooling plan ineffective or impractical in this state, the director shall adopt rules in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

5. If fifty-one percent of the producers and producer-dealers voting representing fifty-one percent of the milk produced and fifty-one percent of the milk dealers and producer-dealers in the market area vote to terminate a pooling plan, the director, within one hundred twenty days, shall terminate all the provisions of said market area and pooling arrangement.

6. A referendum of affected producers, producer-dealers, and milk dealers shall be conducted only when a market area pooling arrangement is to be established. Only producers, milk dealers, and producer-dealers who are subject to the plan may vote on the termination of a pooling plan.

\[ [1993 c 345 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5263-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20345%20§%208); [1992 c 58 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6155.SL.pdf?cite=1992%20c%2058%20§%204); [1991 c 239 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5476.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20239%20§%208); [1971 ex.s. c 230 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c230.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20230%20§%2011); \]

## 15.35.115 - Referendum on establishing or discontinuing market area pooling arrangement—Producer-dealers.
1. Not less than sixty days before a referendum creating a market area and pooling plan with quotas is to be conducted under RCW 15.35.110, the director shall notify each producer-dealer regarding the referendum. Any producer-dealer may choose to vote on the referendum and each choosing to do so shall notify the director in writing of this choice not later than thirty days before the referendum is conducted. Such a producer-dealer and any person who becomes a producer-dealer or producer by acquiring the quota of such a producer-dealer shall be a fully regulated producer under such an approved plan and shall receive a quota which is not less than the sales of milk in fluid form from the producer facilities during the reference period used by the director in determining quotas for producers. Such a producer-dealer shall also be a fully regulated milk dealer under the terms of such an approved plan. RCW 15.35.310(1) does not apply to a producer-dealer who is subject to regulation under this subsection.

2. If a person was not a producer-dealer at the time notice was provided to producer-dealers under subsection (1) of this section regarding a referendum on a proposed market area and pooling plan with quotas, the plan was approved by referendum, and the person subsequently became a producer-dealer (other than by virtue of the person's acquisition of the quota of a producer-dealer who is fully regulated under the plan), the person is subject to all of the terms of the plan for producers and milk dealers during the duration of the plan and RCW 15.35.310(1) does not apply to such a person with regard to that plan.

3. This subsection applies: To a person who was a producer-dealer at the time the notice was provided to producer-dealers under subsection (1) of this section regarding a referendum which was approved and who did not notify the director under subsection (1) of this section to vote in that referendum; and to a person who acquires the facility of such a person.

If such a person's sales of milk in fluid form subsequent to the adoption of the plan increases such that those sales in any year are more than fifty percent greater than the sales of milk in fluid form from the producer facilities during any of the previous five years, RCW 15.35.310(1) does not apply to that person with regard to that plan. Such a producer-dealer shall be a fully regulated producer under such an approved plan and shall receive a quota which is not less than the producer-dealer's sales of milk in fluid form during the reference period used by the director in determining quotas for producers. Such a producer-dealer shall also be a fully regulated dealer under the terms of such an approved plan.

If changes are made, on a market area-wide basis, to the quotas established under the plan, the director shall by rule adjust the fifty percent limitation provided by this section by an equivalent amount.

\[ [1993 c 345 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5263-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20345%20§%209); [1992 c 58 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6155.SL.pdf?cite=1992%20c%2058%20§%202); \]

## 15.35.120 - Qualifications for producers to sign petitions or vote in referendums.
1. The producers qualified to sign a petition, or to vote in any referendum concerning a market pool, shall be all those producers shipping milk to the market area on a regular supply basis and who would or do receive or pay equalization in an existing market pool in a market area, or in a market pool if established in such market area.

2. The milk dealers qualified to vote in any referendum establishing a market pool shall be all those milk dealers who operate a plant which is located within the state and who would receive milk priced under a market pool if established in such market area.

3. The director is authorized during business hours to review the books and records of milk dealers to obtain a list of the producers qualified to sign petitions or to vote in referendums and to verify that such milk dealers are qualified to vote in a referendum.

\[ [1991 c 239 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5476.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20239%20§%209); [1971 ex.s. c 230 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c230.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20230%20§%2012); \]

## 15.35.130 - Form of producer petitions.
Petitions filed with the director by producers shall:

1. The director shall establish a system of classifying, pricing, and pooling of all milk used in each market area established under RCW 15.35.110.

2. Thereafter the director may establish a system in each market area for the equalization of returns for all quota milk and all surplus over quota milk whereby all producers selling milk to milk dealers or delivering milk in such market area, or their cooperative associations, will receive the same prices for all quota milk and all surplus over quota milk, except that any premium paid to a producer by a dealer above established prices shall not be considered in determining average pool prices. Such prices may reflect adjustments based on the value of component parts of each producer's milk.

## 15.35.150 - Determination of quota.
1. Under a market pool and as used in this section, "quota" means a producer's or producer-dealer's portion of the total sales of milk in a market area in fluid form or, in the director's discretion, in other forms.

2. The director may in each market area subject to a market plan establish each producer's and each producer-dealer's initial quota in the market area. Such initial quotas shall be determined by the department after due notice and the opportunity for a hearing as provided in chapter 34.05 RCW. In making this determination, consideration shall be given to a history of the producer's production record. In no case shall a producer-dealer receive as a quota an amount which is less than his or her fluid milk sales for the reference period used by the director in determining quotas for other producers.

In any system of establishing quotas, provision shall be made for new producers to qualify for allocation of quota in a reasonable proportion and for old and new producers to participate in any new increase in available quota in a reasonable proportion. The director may establish a method to proportionately decrease quota allocations in the event decreases in milk usage occur.

All subsequent changes or new quotas issued shall be determined by the department after due notice and the opportunity for a hearing as provided in chapter 34.05 RCW.
