## 15.66.015 - Regulating agricultural commodities—Existing comprehensive scheme.
The history, economy, culture, and the future of Washington state to a large degree all involve agriculture. In order to develop and promote Washington's agricultural products as part of the existing comprehensive scheme to regulate agricultural commodities, the legislature declares:

1. That the marketing of agricultural products within this state is in the public interest. It is vital to the continued economic well-being of the citizens of this state and their general welfare that its agricultural commodities be properly promoted by (a) enabling producers of agricultural commodities to help themselves in establishing orderly, fair, sound, efficient, and unhampered marketing, grading, and standardizing of the commodities they produce; and (b) working towards stabilizing the agricultural industry by increasing consumption of agricultural commodities within the state, the nation, and internationally;

2. That farmers and ranchers operate within a regulatory environment that imposes burdens on them for the benefit of society and the citizens of the state and includes restrictions on marketing autonomy. Those restrictions may impair the agricultural producer's ability to compete in local, domestic, and foreign markets;

3. That it is now in the overriding public interest that support for the agricultural industry be clearly expressed, that adequate protection be given to agricultural commodities, uses, activities, and operations, and that each agricultural commodity be promoted individually, and as part of a comprehensive industry to:

   a. Enhance the reputation and image of Washington state's agricultural commodities;

   b. Increase the sale and use of Washington state's agricultural commodities in local, domestic, and foreign markets;

   c. Protect the public by educating the public in reference to the quality, care, and methods used in the production of Washington state's agricultural commodities;

   d. Increase the knowledge of the health-giving qualities and dietetic value of Washington state's agricultural commodities and products; and

   e. Support and engage in programs or activities that benefit the planting, production, harvesting, handling, processing, marketing, and uses of agricultural commodities produced in Washington state;

4. That the director seek to enhance, protect, and perpetuate the ability of the private sector to produce food and fiber, and seek to maintain the economic well-being of the agricultural industry in Washington state consistent with its regulatory activities and responsibilities;

5. That the director is hereby authorized to implement, administer, and enforce this chapter through the adoption of marketing orders that establish commodity commissions; and

6. That this chapter is enacted in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state.

## 15.66.150 - Annual assessments—Rate—Collection.
There is hereby levied, and there shall be collected by each commission, upon each and every unit of any agricultural commodity specified in any marketing order an annual assessment which shall be paid by the producer thereof upon each and every such unit sold, processed, stored, or delivered for sale, processing, or storage by him or her. Such assessments shall be expressed as a stated amount of money per unit or as a percentage of the net unit price at the time of sale. The total amount of such annual assessment to be paid by all affected producers of such commodity shall not exceed three percent of the total market value of all affected units sold, processed, stored, or delivered for sale, processing, or storage by all affected producers of such units during the year to which the assessment applies.

Every marketing order shall prescribe the per unit or percentage rate of such assessment. Such rate may be at the full amount of, or at any lesser amount than the amount hereinabove limited and may be altered from time to time by amendment of such order. In every such marketing order and amendment the determination of such rate shall be based upon the volume and price of sales of affected units during a period which the director determines to be a representative period. The per unit or percentage rate of assessment prescribed in any such order or amendment shall for all purposes and times be deemed to be within the limits of assessment above provided until such time as such order is amended as to such rate. However, at the end of any year, any affected producer may obtain a refund from the commission of any assessment payments made which exceed three percent of the total market value of all of the affected commodity sold, processed, stored, or delivered for sale, processing, or storage by such producer during the year. Such refund shall be made only upon satisfactory proof given by such producer in accordance with reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by the director. Such market value shall be based upon the average sales price received by such producer during the year from all his or her bona fide sales or, if such producer did not sell twenty-five percent or more of all of the affected commodity produced by him or her during the year, such market value shall be determined by the director upon other sales of the affected commodity determined by the director to be representative and comparable.

To collect such assessment each order may require:

1. Stamps to be purchased from the affected commodity commission or other authority stated in such order and attached to the containers, invoices, shipping documents, inspection certificates, releases, or receiving receipts or tickets (said stamps to be canceled immediately upon being attached and the date of cancellation placed thereon).

2. Payment of producer assessments before the affected units are shipped off the farm or payment of assessments at different or later times, and in such event the order may require any person subject to the assessment to give adequate assurance or security for its payment.

3. Every affected producer subject to assessment under such order to deposit with the commission in advance an amount based on the estimated number of affected units upon which such person will be subject to such assessment in any one year during which such marketing order is in force, or upon any other basis which the director determines to be reasonable and equitable and specifies in such order, but in no event shall such deposit exceed twenty-five percent of the estimated total annual assessment payable by such person. At the close of such marketing year the sums so deposited shall be adjusted to the total of such assessments payable by such person.

4. Handlers receiving the affected commodity from the producer, including warehouse operators and processors, to collect producer assessments from producers whose production they handle and remit the same to the affected commission. The lending agency for a commodity credit corporation loan to producers shall be deemed a handler for the purpose of this subsection. No affected units shall be transported, carried, shipped, sold, stored, or otherwise handled or disposed of until every due and payable assessment herein provided for has been paid and the receipt issued, but no liability hereunder shall attach to common carriers in the regular course of their business.

If the commodity commission finds that the amounts of moneys are so small as to make impractical the computation and remitting of the pro rata refund, the moneys shall be paid into the state treasury as unclaimed trust moneys; and

4. Transfer all remaining files to the department for storage and archiving, as appropriate.

Any due and payable assessment herein levied, and every sum due under any marketing order in a specified amount shall constitute a personal debt of every person so assessed or who otherwise owes the same, and the same shall be due and payable to the commission when payment is called for by the commission. In the event any person fails to pay the full amount of such assessment or such other sum on or before the date due, the commission may add to such unpaid assessment or sum an amount not exceeding ten percent of the same to defray the cost of enforcing the collecting of the same. In the event of failure of such person or persons to pay any such due and payable assessment or other such sum, the commission may bring a civil action against such person or persons in a state court of competent jurisdiction for the collection thereof, together with the above specified ten percent thereon, and such action shall be tried and judgment rendered as in any other cause of action for debt due and payable.

The director shall hold a public hearing upon such application. Not less than five days prior thereto he or she shall give written notice thereof to all producers whom he or she determines may be proper parties to such agreement and shall publish such notice at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected area.

2. That such agreement will tend to effectuate its purpose and the declared policies of this chapter and conforms to law;

3. That enough persons who produce a sufficient amount of the affected commodity to tend to effectuate said policies and purposes and to provide sufficient moneys to defray the necessary expenses of formulation, issuance, administration, and enforcement have agreed in writing to said agreement.

Such agreement may be for any of the purposes and may contain any of the provisions that a marketing order may contain under the provisions of this chapter but no other purposes and provisions. A commodity commission created by such agreement shall in all respects have all powers and duties as a commodity commission created by a marketing order. Such agreement shall be binding upon, and only upon, persons who have signed the agreement: PROVIDED, That a cooperative association may, in behalf of its members, execute any and all marketing agreements authorized hereunder, and upon so doing, such agreement so executed shall be binding upon said cooperative association and its members. Such agreements shall go into force when the director endorses his or her approval in writing upon the agreement and so notifies all who have signed the agreement. Additional signatories may be added at any time with the approval of the director. Every agreement shall remain in force and be binding upon all persons so agreeing for the period specified in such agreement but the agreement shall provide a time at least once in every twelve months when any or all such persons may withdraw upon giving notice as provided in the agreement. Such an agreement may be amended or terminated in the same manner as herein provided for its creation and may also be terminated whenever after the withdrawal of any signatory the director finds on the basis of evidence presented at such hearing that not enough persons remain signatory to such agreement to effectuate the purposes of the agreement or the policies of the act or to provide sufficient moneys to defray necessary expenses. However, in the event that a cooperative association is signatory to the marketing agreement in behalf of its members, the action of the cooperative association shall be considered the action of its members for the purpose of determining withdrawal or termination.
