## 15.04.150 - Berry harvesting by youthful workers—Legislative finding.
The legislature finds that the crops of berry growers in the state are imperiled by a recent change in the federal law relating to youthful agricultural workers. Since the berry harvest season is so short that few migrant agricultural workers find the trip to this state to pick berries worth the trouble, the long-established use of younger pickers must be permitted to the extent where such employment will not interfere with interstate commerce and the federal law. Further, the legislature finds that such employment is healthful, a good indoctrination for youth in the work ethic and the role of agriculture in society, and an opportunity youths welcome to earn extra spending money.

\[ [1975 1st ex.s. c 238 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1975ex1c238.pdf?cite=1975%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20238%20§%201); \]

## 15.04.160 - Berry harvesting by youthful workers—Authorized—Restrictions.
1. An employee engaged to pick berries in this state outside of school hours for the school district where such employee is living while so employed may be less than twelve years of age: PROVIDED, That (a) the employee is employed with the consent of his or her parent or person standing in the place of his or her parent, (b) the berries are for sale within the state only, and are not to be shipped out of the state in any form; (c) the secretary of agriculture or his or her designated representative has certified that there are not sufficient workers available in the immediate area to harvest the crop without such youthful employees, and (d) all employees of any employer engaging youthful employees are paid at the same rate for picking berries.

2. Each basket, package, or other container containing berries or berry products picked by an employee under twelve years of age shall be distinctively marked so as to insure that the berries do not enter interstate commerce: PROVIDED HOWEVER, That nothing in RCW 15.04.150 and 15.04.160 shall apply to employers who are exempt from the federal fair labor standards act.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 6004](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%206004); [1975 1st ex.s. c 238 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1975ex1c238.pdf?cite=1975%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20238%20§%202); \]

## 15.04.200 - Agricultural development or trade promotion and promotional hosting—Expenditures, approval by commodity commission—Exemption from housing requirements.
1. Under the authority of Article VIII of the state Constitution as amended, agricultural commodity commission expenditures for agricultural development or trade promotion and promotional hosting by an agricultural commodities commission under chapters 15.24, 15.28, 15.44, 15.65, 15.66, 15.88, 15.89, 15.115, and 16.67 RCW shall be pursuant to specific budget items as approved by the agricultural commodity commission at the annual public hearings on the agricultural commodity commission budget.

All payments and reimbursements shall be identified and supported on vouchers.

3. Agricultural commodity commissions shall be exempt from the requirements of RCW 43.01.090 and 43.19.500 and chapter 43.82 RCW.

## 15.04.300 - Guide to state and federal programs of assistance to farm families.
The department of agriculture is authorized to develop, in cooperation with Washington State University and other state agencies, an informational guide to programs offered by state and federal agencies which would be of assistance to farm families. The informational guide shall be made available to farmers and ranchers through county extension offices, farm organizations, and other appropriate means.

\[ [1987 c 393 § 26](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c393.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20393%20§%2026); \]

## 15.04.400 - Findings—Department's duty to promote agriculture, protect public health and welfare.
The history, economy, culture, and the future of Washington state to a large degree all involve agriculture, which is vital to the economic well-being of the state. The legislature finds that farmers and ranchers are responsible stewards of the land, but are increasingly subjected to complaints and unwarranted restrictions that encourage, and even force, the premature removal of lands from agricultural uses.

The legislature further finds that it is now in the overriding public interest that support for agriculture be clearly expressed and that adequate protection be given to agricultural lands, uses, activities, and operations.

The legislature further finds that the department of agriculture has a duty to promote and protect agriculture and its dependent rural community in Washington state however, the duty shall not be construed as to diminish the responsibility of the department to fully carry out its assigned regulatory responsibilities to protect the public health and welfare.

\[ [1994 c 46 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6463-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%2046%20§%209); [1991 c 280 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5096-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20280%20§%201); \]

## 15.04.402 - Department to advance private sector, economic well-being of agricultural industry.
The department shall seek to enhance, protect, and perpetuate the ability of the private sector to produce food and fiber. Additionally, the department shall seek, consistent with its regulatory responsibilities, to maintain the economic well-being of the agricultural industry and its dependent rural community in Washington state.

\[ [1994 c 46 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6463-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%2046%20§%2010); [1991 c 280 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5096-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20280%20§%202); \]

## 15.04.410 - Declarations of "Washington state grown"—Restrictions—Violations unlawful—Application of consumer protection act.
1. Before being offered for retail sale in this state, any agricultural commodity, defined under RCW 15.66.010, that was grown or raised in this state may be advertised, labeled, described, sold, marked, or otherwise held out, with the words "Washington state grown," or other similar language indicating that the product is from Washington state grown or raised agricultural commodities.

2. An agricultural commodity that was not grown or raised in this state and packages of that product shall not be advertised, labeled, described, sold, marked, or otherwise held out as "Washington state grown," or in any way as to imply that such product is a Washington state grown or raised agricultural commodity.

3. It is unlawful for any person to violate this section.

4. The legislature finds that the practices covered by this section are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Violations of this section are not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business. A violation of this section is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

## 15.04.415 - Information on product country of origin—Findings—Use of placards.
1. The legislature finds that it is a common practice for consumers to be provided information as to the country [of] origin for many products available to them for purchase. The legislature finds that consumers have a right to know the origin of the fresh fruits and vegetables being offered to them at retail sale. The legislature finds that there is value to the consumer being able to make an informed buying decision as to whether the fresh fruit or vegetable was produced under standards and conditions required in the United States. Further, the legislature finds that consumers should be given the ability to make an informed choice to buy fresh fruits and vegetables that are grown in Washington state as a means of supporting the economy of the state.

2. Stores or other businesses offering fresh fruit and vegetables for retail sale to consumers shall place a placard on the bin, shelf, or other location the product is displayed that informs the consumer where the fruit or vegetable was grown if it was grown in the United States or grown in Washington. The placard shall indicate that the product was either "Grown in United States" or "Grown in Washington." Placards are not required if (a) the product was grown outside of the United States, or (b) each item in the bin, shelf, or other location contains a sticker or label that indicates where the fruit or vegetable product was grown.

   a. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department must establish and implement a compost reimbursement program to reimburse farming operations in the state for purchasing and using compost products that were not generated by the farming operation, including transportation, spreading equipment, labor, fuel, and maintenance costs associated with spreading equipment.

The applicant must also declare that it is not seeking reimbursement for purchase or labor costs for:

   a. Its own compost products; or

   b. Compost products that it has transferred, or intends to transfer, to another individual or entity, whether or not for compensation.

4.

Applications for reimbursement must be filed before the end of the fiscal year in which purchases were made and usage costs incurred.

5. The department must distribute reimbursement funds, subject to the following limitations:

   a. A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement if the farming operation's application was not found eligible for reimbursement by the department under subsection (2) of this section prior to the transport or use of compost;

   b. A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for more than 50 percent of the costs it incurs each fiscal year for the purchase and use of compost products, including transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor costs;

   c. A farming operation is not eligible to receive more than $10,000 per fiscal year;

   d. A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for its own compost products or compost products that it has transferred, or intends to transfer, to another individual or entity, whether or not for compensation; and

   e. A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for compost products that were not purchased from a facility with a solid waste handling permit.

6. The applicant shall indemnify and hold harmless the state and its officers, agents, and employees from all claims arising out of or resulting from the compost products purchased that are subject to the compost reimbursement program under this section.

8. In compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department must submit an annual report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by January 15th of each year of the program in which grants have been issued or completed. The report must include:

   a. The amount of compost for which reimbursement was sought under the program;

   b. The qualitative or quantitative effects of the program on soil quality and carbon storage; and

   c. A periodically updated evaluation of the benefits and costs to the state of expanding or furthering the strategies promoted in the program.
