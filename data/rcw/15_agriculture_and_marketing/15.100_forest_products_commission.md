## 15.100.010 - Finding.
The legislature finds that the creation of a forest products commission would assist in expanding the state's economy, because:

1. Marketing is a dynamic and changing part of the Washington forest products industry and a vital element in expanding the state economy;

2. The sale in the state and export to other states and abroad of forest products made in the state contribute substantial benefits to the economy of the state, provide a large number of jobs and sizeable tax revenues, and are key components of the health of many local communities because many secondary businesses are largely dependent on the health of the forest products industry; and

3. Forest products are made from a renewable resource and are more environmentally sound than many alternative products.

## 15.100.030 - Washington forest products commission—Created—Membership—Quorum—Terms.
1. [Empty]

   a. There is created a commodity commission to be known and designated as the Washington forest products commission. The commission is composed of nine voting members. The commission may, in its sole discretion, add or remove nonvoting ex officio members to the commission. Of the members, six shall be from western Washington, and three shall be from eastern Washington. After the initial election of commission members, however, if a position cannot be filled by a member from eastern Washington within sixty days from the date on which nominations may first be received because of a lack of candidates, the position may be filled by a member from western Washington. Under no circumstances will there be less than two board members from eastern Washington. If a position was filled by a member from western Washington because of a lack of candidates from eastern Washington, and districts are not used for the nomination and election of members, then a person from eastern Washington must fill the next available vacancy or open position at the next election to bring the number of representatives from eastern Washington up to three members. All members shall be elected by the entire group of producers unless the commission creates districts for the members as authorized in RCW 15.100.050. If districts are used for the nomination and election of commission members, and it does not appear that one of the positions from eastern Washington will be filled because of a lack of candidates, then a commission member who resides in western Washington must be elected by the entire group of producers as an at large member. The position of the western Washington member who is elected as an at large member shall be filled by a member from eastern Washington at the expiration of the term of the at large member. If districts are not used for the nomination and election of members, the commission shall strive to achieve representation on the commission from the different geographic regions of the state.

   b. Of the six members from western Washington, three members must have annual harvests of more than seventy-five million board feet, and three members must have annual harvests between two million board feet and seventy-five million board feet.

   c. Of the two members from eastern Washington, one member must have an annual harvest greater than forty million board feet, and one member must have an annual harvest between two million board feet and forty million board feet. If there is a third member from eastern Washington, the only harvest requirement is that the member have an annual harvest of at least two million board feet.

2. The members must be citizens and residents of this state, and over the age of twenty-one years. Each member must currently, and for the five years last preceding his or her election, be actually engaged in producing forest products within the state of Washington, either individually or as an officer of a corporation, firm, partnership, trust, association, or business organization at the level of production required to qualify as a producer. Each member must also derive a substantial amount of his or her income from the production of forest products. The qualifications set forth in this section apply throughout each member's term of office.

3. No more than one member of the commission may be employed by, or connected in a proprietary capacity with, the same corporation, firm, partnership, trust, association, or business organization.

4. Five voting members of the commission constitute a quorum for the transaction of all business and the carrying out of the duties of the commission.

5. The regular term of office of the members is four years from November 1st following their election and until their successors are elected and qualified. However, the first terms of the members elected in the initial November 1st election is as follows: Positions one, four, and seven terminate on November 1st, two years after the initial election is held; positions two, five, and eight terminate on November 1st, three years after the initial election is held; and positions three, six, and nine terminate on November 1st, four years after the initial election is held.

3. For the initial election of commission members, any qualified producer may be nominated orally for a commissioner position at the meeting convened by the director. Nominations may also be made within five days prior to the meeting by a written petition filed with the department, signed by at least five producers who reside in the state. If the director determines that one of the positions from eastern Washington will go unfilled because of a lack of candidates, the director shall announce that this position shall be filled by a member from western Washington. If the position designated for eastern Washington is filled by a member from western Washington because of a lack of candidates from eastern Washington, this position shall be designated as position number seven by the director for purposes of RCW 15.100.030(5). Under no circumstances will there be less than two board members from eastern Washington.

4. The initial members of the commission shall be elected by secret mail ballot under the supervision of the director at the same time the referendum is submitted under RCW 15.100.120 calling for the creation of the commission and the imposition of the initial assessment.

Public notice of the meeting shall be given by the commission in the manner it determines is appropriate.

The commission shall submit any proposed increase in the assessment to producers pursuant to the referendum process established in this section, and shall supply all known producers with a ballot for the referendum. The commission shall establish the assessment for the marketing year by January 1st of each year, or as soon thereafter as possible. Assessments may only be used for the purposes and objects of this chapter.

3. The forest products commission may raise the assessment on forest products in excess of the fiscal growth factor under chapter 43.135 RCW.

However, any alteration in assessments made under this section must be made with the procedural requirements established by this chapter for altering such assessments.

4. The requirement for approval of an assessment is met if: (a) At least fifty-one percent by numbers of producers replying in the referendum vote affirmatively, and these producers represent at least sixty-one percent of the volume of the producers replying in the referendum; or (b) sixty-five percent by numbers of producers replying in the referendum vote affirmatively, and these producers represent at least fifty-one percent of the volume of the producers replying in the referendum.

## 15.100.120 - Establishment of commission and initial assessment—Statewide referendum among producers.
1. For purposes of determining producer participation in the commission, the initial election of commissioners, and for imposition of the original assessment specified in RCW 15.100.110, the director shall conduct a referendum among all producers of forest products within the state.

2. The requirement for approval of the assessment and creation of the commission is met if: (a) At least fifty-one percent by numbers of producers replying in the referendum vote affirmatively, and these producers represent at least sixty-one percent of the volume of the producers replying in the referendum; or (b) sixty-five percent by numbers of producers replying in the referendum vote affirmatively, and these producers represent at least fifty-one percent of the volume of the producers replying in the referendum. The referendum shall only be approved if at least forty percent of the eligible producers participate in the vote.

3. If the director determines that the requisite approval has been given, the director shall declare the establishment of the commission and direct it to put into force the assessment authorized in RCW 15.100.110. If the director finds that the requisite approval has not been given, then this chapter is not operative.

The commission shall deposit moneys collected under RCW 15.100.110 in a separate account in the name of the commission in any bank that is a state depositary. All expenditures and disbursements made from this account under this chapter may be made without the necessity of a specific legislative appropriation.

\[ [2001 c 314 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1835-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2001%20c%20314%20§%2013); \]

## 15.100.140 - Assessment—Personal debt—Payable when called—Failure to pay—Civil action.
A due and payable assessment levied in the amount determined by the commission under RCW 15.100.110 constitutes a personal debt of every person so assessed, or who otherwise owes the assessment, and the assessment is due and payable to the commission when payment is called for by the commission. If a person fails to pay the commission the full amount of the assessment by the date due, the commission may add to the unpaid assessment an amount not exceeding ten percent of the assessment to defray the cost of enforcing its collection. If the person fails to pay any due and payable assessment or other such sum, the commission may bring a civil action for collection against the person or persons in a court of competent jurisdiction. The action shall be tried and judgment rendered as in any other cause of action for a debt due and payable.
