## 15.140.010 - Intent.
The legislature intends to:

1. Authorize and establish a new licensing and regulatory program for hemp production in this state in accordance with the agriculture improvement act of 2018;

2. Replace the industrial hemp research program in *chapter 15.120 RCW, with the new licensing and regulatory program established in this chapter, and enable hemp growers licensed under the industrial hemp research program on the effective date of rules implementing this chapter and regulating hemp production, to transfer into the program created in this chapter; and

3. Authorize the growing of hemp as a legal, agricultural activity in this state. Hemp is an agricultural product that may be legally grown, produced, processed, possessed, transferred, commercially sold, and traded. Hemp and processed hemp produced in accordance with this chapter or produced lawfully under the laws of another state, tribe, or country may be transferred and sold within the state, outside of this state, and internationally. Nothing in this chapter is intended to prevent or restrain commerce in this state involving hemp or hemp products produced lawfully under the laws of another state, tribe, or country.

No rule may establish such a distance requirement, limitation, or buffer zone without the evaluation of sufficient data showing impacts to either crop as a result of cross-pollination.

2. Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, in an effort to prevent cross-pollination between hemp plants produced under this chapter and cannabis plants produced under chapter 69.50 RCW, the department, in consultation with the liquor and cannabis board, must review the state's policy regarding cross-pollination and pollen capture to ensure an appropriate policy is in place, and must modify policies or establish new policies as appropriate. Under any such policy, when a documented conflict involving cross-pollination exists between two farms or production facilities growing or producing hemp or cannabis, the farm or production facility operating first in time shall have the right to continue operating and the farm or production facility operating second in time must cease growing or producing hemp or cannabis, as applicable.

Upon the submittal of the plan to the United States department of agriculture, the department may conduct initial expedited rule making under RCW 34.05.353 to establish rules to allow hemp licenses to be issued without delay.

2. On the effective date of rules adopted by the department regulating hemp production under chapter 15.140 RCW, a licensed hemp producer under this chapter may immediately produce hemp pursuant to chapter 15.140 RCW with all the privileges of a hemp producer licensed under chapter 15.140 RCW.
