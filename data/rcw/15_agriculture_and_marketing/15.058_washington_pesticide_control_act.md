1. If it does not appear to the director that the pesticide is such as to warrant the proposed claims for it or if the pesticide and its labeling and other material required to be submitted do not comply with the provisions of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, the registrant shall be notified of the manner in which the pesticide, labeling, or other material required to be submitted fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter so as to afford the applicant an opportunity to make the necessary corrections.

If the owner or custodian is not available for service of the order, the director may attach the order to the pesticide or device. The pesticide or device shall not be sold, used or removed until the provisions of this chapter have been complied with and the pesticide or device has been released in writing under conditions specified by the director, or the violation has been otherwise disposed of as provided in this chapter by a court of competent jurisdiction.

\[ [1989 c 380 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c380.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20380%20§%2012); [1971 ex.s. c 190 § 16](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c190.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20190%20§%2016); \]

## 15.58.170 - "Stop sale, use or removal" order—Adjudication.
1. After service of a "stop sale, use or removal" order is made upon any person, either that person or the director may file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which a violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter is alleged to have occurred for an adjudication of the alleged violation. The court in such action may issue temporary or permanent injunctions mandatory or restraining, and such intermediate orders as it deems necessary or advisable. The court may order condemnation of any pesticide or device which does not meet the requirements of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter: PROVIDED, That no authority is granted hereunder to affect the sale or use of products on which legally approved pesticides have been legally used.

## 15.58.180 - Pesticide dealer license—Generally.
1. Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, it is unlawful for any person to act in the capacity of a pesticide dealer or advertise as or assume to act as a pesticide dealer without first having obtained an annual license from the director. The license expires on the business license expiration date. A license is required for each location or outlet located within this state from which pesticides are distributed. A manufacturer, registrant, or distributor who has no pesticide dealer outlet licensed within this state and who distributes pesticides directly into this state must obtain a pesticide dealer license for his or her principal out-of-state location or outlet, but such a licensed out-of-state pesticide dealer is exempt from the pesticide dealer manager requirements.

2. Application for a license must be accompanied by a fee of eighty-eight dollars and must be made through the business licensing system and must include the full name of the person applying for the license and the name of the individual within the state designated as the pesticide dealer manager. If the applicant is a partnership, association, corporation, or organized group of persons, the full name of each member of the firm or partnership or the names of the officers of the association or corporation must be given on the application. The application must state the principal business address of the applicant in the state and elsewhere, the name of a person domiciled in this state authorized to receive and accept service of summons of legal notices of all kinds for the applicant, and any other necessary information prescribed by the director.

3. It is unlawful for any licensed dealer outlet to operate without a pesticide dealer manager who has a license of qualification.

4. This section does not apply to (a) a licensed pesticide applicator who sells pesticides only as an integral part of the applicator's pesticide application service when pesticides are dispensed only through apparatuses used for pesticide application, or (b) any federal, state, county, or municipal agency that provides pesticides only for its own programs.

Upon the receipt of service of such certified copy the department shall direct the financial institution to pay from the assigned account, through the registry of the court which rendered judgment, towards the amount of the unsatisfied judgment. The priority of payment from the assigned account shall be the order of receipt of the final judgment by the department.

2. Nothing in subsection (1) of this section that limits the time period in which a suit must be commenced on a surety bond or in which a claim must be made on a policy effects the statute of limitations applicable to any claim any person may have against the structural pest inspector or company.
