\[ [1959 c 218 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1959c218.pdf?cite=1959%20c%20218%20§%2014); \]

## 54.04.020 - Districts authorized.
Municipal corporations, to be known as public utility districts, are hereby authorized for the purposes of chapter 1, Laws of 1931 and may be established within the limits of the state of Washington, as provided herein.

\[ [1931 c 1 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1931c1.pdf?cite=1931%20c%201%20§%202); RRS § 11606; \]

## 54.04.030 - Restrictions on invading other municipalities.
Chapter 1, Laws of 1931, shall not be deemed or construed to repeal or affect any existing act, or any part thereof, relating to the construction, operation and maintenance of public utilities by irrigation or water-sewer districts or other municipal corporations, but shall be supplemental thereto and concurrent therewith. No public utility district created hereunder shall include therein any municipal corporation, or any part thereof, where such municipal corporation already owns or operates all the utilities herein authorized: PROVIDED, that in case it does not own or operate all such utilities it may be included within such public utility district for the purpose of establishing or operating therein such utilities as it does not own or operate: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That no property situated within any irrigation or water-sewer districts or other municipal corporations shall ever be taxed or assessed to pay for any utility, or part thereof, of like character to any utility, owned or operated by such irrigation or water districts or other municipal corporations.

\[ [1999 c 153 § 64](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1264.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%20153%20§%2064); [1931 c 1 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1931c1.pdf?cite=1931%20c%201%20§%2012); RRS § 11616; \]

## 54.04.035 - Annexation of territory.
In addition to other powers authorized in Title 54 RCW, public utility districts may annex territory as provided in this section.

The boundaries of a public utility district may be enlarged and new contiguous territory added pursuant to the procedures for annexation by cities and towns provided in RCW 35.13.015 through 35.13.110. The provisions of these sections concerning community municipal corporations, review boards, and comprehensive plans, however, do not apply to public utility district annexations. For purposes of conforming with such procedures, the public utility district is deemed to be the city or town and the board of commissioners is deemed to be the city or town legislative body.

Annexation procedures provided in this section may only be used to annex territory that is both: (1) Contiguous to the annexing public utility district; and (2) located within the service area of the annexing public utility district. As used in this section, a public utility district's "service area" means those areas whether located within or outside of the annexing public utility district's boundaries that were generally served with electrical energy by the annexing public utility district on January 1, 1987. Such service area may, or may not, have been recognized in an agreement made under chapter 54.48 RCW, but no area may be included within such service area that was generally served with electrical energy on January 1, 1987, by another public utility as defined in RCW 54.48.010. An area proposed to be annexed may be located in the same or a different county as the annexing public utility district.

If an area proposed to be annexed is located within the boundaries of another public utility district, annexation may be initiated only upon petition of registered voters residing in the area in accordance with RCW 35.13.020 and adoption by the boards of commissioners of both districts of identical resolutions stating (a) the boundaries of the area to be annexed, (b) a determination that annexation is in the public interest of the residents of the area to be annexed as well as the public interest of their respective districts, (c) approval of annexation by the board, (d) the boundaries of the districts after annexation, (e) the disposition of any assets of the districts in the area to be annexed, (f) the obligations to be assumed by the annexing district, (g) apportionment of election costs, and (h) that voters in the area to be annexed will be advised of lawsuits that may impose liability on the annexed territory and the possible impact of annexation on taxes and utility rates.

If annexation is approved, the area annexed shall cease to be a part of the one public utility district at the same time that it becomes a part of the other district. The annexing public utility district shall assume responsibility for providing the area annexed with the services provided by the other public utility district in the area annexed.

\[ [1987 c 292 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c292.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20292%20§%202); [1983 c 101 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c101.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20101%20§%201); \]

## 54.04.037 - Annexation of territory—Coordination among county officials.
When territory has been added to a public utility district in accordance with RCW 54.04.035, the supervisor of elections and other officers of the county in which the public utility district first operated shall coordinate elections, the levy and collection of taxes, and other necessary duties with the appropriate county officials of the other county.

\[ [1987 c 292 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c292.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20292%20§%203); \]

## 54.04.039 - County with federal nuclear reservation within its boundaries—Special procedure for addition or withdrawal of territory from public utility district.
1. Any voting precinct located within a county that has a federal nuclear reservation within its boundaries is:

   a. Withdrawn from a public utility district if the precinct receives at least one electric distribution, water, or sewer service from a city, and no electric distribution, water, or sewer service from a public utility district;

   b. Included in a public utility district if any portion of the precinct receives at least one electric distribution, water, or sewer service from the public utility district.

2. For voting precincts that meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, within ten days after March 24, 2004, and for voting precincts that later meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, within thirty days of meeting the requirements:

   a. The city that provides any electric distribution, water, or sewer service to a precinct that is withdrawn from a public utility district under subsection (1) of this section shall submit to the public utility district and the county auditor a list of street addresses, or map of the areas to which any service is provided;

   b. The public utility district that provides any electric distribution, water, or sewer service to a precinct that is included in the public utility district under subsection (1) of this section shall submit to the city or town and the county auditor a list of street addresses, or map of the areas to which any service is provided.

3. Within ten days of receipt of the information required under subsection (2) of this section, the auditor shall determine which voting precincts are required to be withdrawn from or included in the public utility district, and provide that information to the public utility district commissioners who shall, within ten days, revise the boundaries of the district in conformance with RCW 54.12.010 without dividing any voting precinct.

4. Unless otherwise provided in an agreement between the public utility district and the city or town, taxes or assessments levied or assessed against property located in an area withdrawn from a public utility district shall remain a lien and be collected as by law (a) if the taxes or assessments were levied or assessed before the withdrawal or (b) if the levies or assessments were made to pay or secure an obligation of the district duly incurred or issued before the withdrawal. The withdrawal of an area from the boundaries of a district does not exempt any property therein from taxation or assessment for the purpose of paying the costs of retiring or redeeming any obligation of the district duly incurred or issued before the withdrawal.

5. Except as set forth in subsection (4) of this section, a public utility district may not levy or impose any taxes upon property located within those voting precincts withdrawn from the public utility district.

6. Nothing in chapter 113, Laws of 2004 limits the authority of public utility districts and cities or towns to enter into service agreements that are otherwise permitted by law.

\[ [2004 c 113 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2891-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20113%20§%202); \]

## 54.04.040 - Utilities within a city or town—Restrictions.
A district shall not construct any property to be utilized by it in the operation of a plant or system for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for sale, on the streets, alleys, or public places within a city or town without the consent of the governing body of the city or town and approval of the plan and location of the construction, which shall be made under such reasonable terms as the city or town may impose. All such properties shall be maintained and operated subject to such regulations as the city or town may prescribe under its police power.

\[ [1957 c 278 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1957c278.pdf?cite=1957%20c%20278%20§%209); [1941 c 245 § 3a](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1941c245.pdf?cite=1941%20c%20245%20§%203a); Rem. Supp. 1941 § 11616-4.  1941 c 245 § 1, part; Rem. Supp. 1941 § 11616-1; \]

## 54.04.045 - Locally regulated utilities—Attachments to poles—Rates—Contracting.
1. As used in this section:

   a. "Attachment" means the affixation or installation of any wire, cable, or other physical material capable of carrying electronic impulses or light waves for the carrying of intelligence for telecommunications or television, including, but not limited to cable, and any related device, apparatus, or auxiliary equipment upon any pole owned or controlled in whole or in part by one or more locally regulated utilities where the installation has been made with the necessary consent.

   b. "Licensee" means any person, firm, corporation, partnership, company, association, joint stock association, or cooperatively organized association, which is authorized to construct attachments upon, along, under, or across public ways.

   c. "Locally regulated utility" means a public utility district not subject to rate or service regulation by the utilities and transportation commission.

   d. "Nondiscriminatory" means that pole owners may not arbitrarily differentiate among or between similar classes of licensees approved for attachments.

2. All rates, terms, and conditions made, demanded, or received by a locally regulated utility for attachments to its poles must be just, reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and sufficient. A locally regulated utility shall levy attachment space rental rates that are uniform for the same class of service within the locally regulated utility service area.

3. A just and reasonable rate must be calculated as follows:

   a. One component of the rate shall consist of the additional costs of procuring and maintaining pole attachments, but may not exceed the actual capital and operating expenses of the locally regulated utility attributable to that portion of the pole, duct, or conduit used for the pole attachment, including a share of the required support and clearance space, in proportion to the space used for the pole attachment, as compared to all other uses made of the subject facilities and uses that remain available to the owner or owners of the subject facilities;

   b. The other component of the rate shall consist of the additional costs of procuring and maintaining pole attachments, but may not exceed the actual capital and operating expenses of the locally regulated utility attributable to the share, expressed in feet, of the required support and clearance space, divided equally among the locally regulated utility and all attaching licensees, in addition to the space used for the pole attachment, which sum is divided by the height of the pole; and

   c. The just and reasonable rate shall be computed by adding one-half of the rate component resulting from (a) of this subsection to one-half of the rate component resulting from (b) of this subsection.

4. For the purpose of establishing a rate under subsection (3)(a) of this section, the locally regulated utility may establish a rate according to the calculation set forth in subsection (3)(a) of this section or it may establish a rate according to the cable formula set forth by the federal communications commission by rule as it existed on June 12, 2008, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the federal communications commission by rule, consistent with the purposes of this section.

5. Except in extraordinary circumstances, a locally regulated utility must respond to a licensee's application to enter into a new pole attachment contract or renew an existing pole attachment contract within forty-five days of receipt, stating either:

   a. The application is complete; or

   b. The application is incomplete, including a statement of what information is needed to make the application complete.

6. Within sixty days of an application being deemed complete, the locally regulated utility shall notify the applicant as to whether the application has been accepted for licensing or rejected. In extraordinary circumstances, and with the approval of the applicant, the locally regulated utility may extend the sixty-day timeline under this subsection. If the application is rejected, the locally regulated utility must provide reasons for the rejection. A request to attach may only be denied on a nondiscriminatory basis (a) where there is insufficient capacity; or (b) for reasons of safety, reliability, or the inability to meet generally applicable engineering standards and practices.

7. Nothing in this section shall be construed or is intended to confer upon the utilities and transportation commission any authority to exercise jurisdiction over locally regulated utilities.

\[ [2008 c 197 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2533-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20197%20§%202); [1996 c 32 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6554-S.SL.pdf?cite=1996%20c%2032%20§%205); \]

## 54.04.050 - Group employee insurance—Deferred compensation plans—Supplemental savings plans.
1. Subject to chapter 48.62 RCW, any public utility district engaged in the operation of electric or water utilities may enter into contracts of group insurance for the benefit of its employees, and pay all or any part of the premiums for such insurance. Such premiums shall be paid out of the revenues derived from the operation of such properties: PROVIDED, That if the premium is to be paid by the district and employees jointly, and the benefits of the policy are offered to all eligible employees, not less than seventy-five percent of such employees may be so insured.

2. A public utility district engaged in the operation of electric or water utilities may establish and maintain for the benefit of its eligible employees and officials any plan of deferred compensation or supplemental savings plan for retirement, and make contributions or pay benefits thereunder out of the revenue derived from the operation of its properties. For purposes of this section, "contributions" includes contributions on behalf of an eligible employee equal to the amount by which the employee agrees to a reduction in salary or wages and also includes contributions made by the public utility district separate from amounts otherwise intended as salary or wages. Coverage of an employee under a plan under this section does not render the employee or official ineligible for simultaneous membership and participation in any pension system for public employees.

3. Contributions must be deposited in designated accounts, held in trust, or remitted to an insurer. When deposited to an account or held in trust, the account or trust fund is considered a public retirement fund within the meaning of Article XXIX, section 1 of the state Constitution, for the purpose of determining eligible investments and deposits of money into the account or trust.

4. Contributions may be deposited or invested in a credit union, savings and loan association, bank, mutual savings bank, purchase life insurance, shares of an investment company, or fixed or variable annuity contracts from any insurance company or any investment company licensed to contract business in this state. To the extent a plan is an individual account plan, participants in the plan may be permitted to self-direct the investment of assets allocated to their account through the selection of investment options authorized under the plan, and an employee, official, or commissioner of the district is not liable for any loss or deficiency resulting from participant investments. An "individual account plan" is a plan that provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based upon the amount contributed to the participant's account, and any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts or other participants which may be allocated to that participant's account.

Supp. 1941 § 11616-6; \]

## 54.04.055 - Employee benefits—District may continue to pay premiums after employee retires.
Any public utility district which provides for the coverage of any of its employees under any plan for individual annuity contracts, retirement income policies, group annuity contracts, group insurance for the benefit of its employees, or any other contract for the benefit of its employees, and pays all or any part of the premiums or other payments required therefor, is hereby authorized to continue to make such payments for such employees after their retirement from employment. Such payments agreed to by the public utility district shall be considered as deferred compensation. Such payments shall not be retroactive but shall only be available for those employees employed on or after August 6, 1965 provided that such payments for retired employees shall not exceed those being paid for regular employees.

\[ [1965 ex.s. c 149 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965ex1c149.pdf?cite=1965%20ex.s.%20c%20149%20§%201); \]

## 54.04.060 - District elections.
The supervisor of elections or other proper officer of the county shall give notice of all elections held under this title, for the time and in the manner and form provided for city, town, school district, and port district elections. When the supervisor or other officer deems an emergency exists, and is requested so to do by a resolution of the district commission, he or she may call a special election at any time in the district, and he or she may combine or divide precincts for the purpose of holding special elections, and special elections shall be conducted and notice thereof given in the manner provided by law.

The supervisor or other officer shall provide polling places, appoint the election officers, provide their compensation, provide ballot boxes, and ballots or voting machines, poll books and tally sheets, and deliver them to the election officers at the polling places, publish and post notices of the elections in the manner provided by law, and apportion to the district its share of the expense of the election.

The manner of conducting and voting at the elections, opening and closing of polls, keeping of poll lists, canvassing the votes, declaring the result, and certifying the returns, shall be the same as for the election of state and county officers, except as otherwise provided herein.

The district commission shall certify to the supervisor a list of offices to be filled at a district election and the commission, if it desires to submit to the voters of the district a proposition, shall require the secretary of the commission to certify it at the time and in the manner and form provided for certifying propositions by the governing board of cities, towns, and port districts.

## 54.04.070 - Contracts for work or materials—Notice—Exemptions—Unit priced contracts.
1. Any item, or items of the same kind of materials, equipment, or supplies purchased, the estimated cost of which is in excess of thirty thousand dollars, exclusive of sales tax, shall be by contract. However, a district may make purchases of the same kind of items of materials, equipment, and supplies not exceeding twelve thousand dollars in any calendar month without a contract, purchasing any excess thereof over twelve thousand dollars by contract.

2. Any work ordered by a district commission, the estimated cost of which is in excess of fifty thousand dollars, exclusive of sales tax, shall be by contract. However, a district commission may have its own regularly employed personnel perform work which is an accepted industry practice under prudent utility management without a contract. For purposes of this section, "prudent utility management" means performing work with regularly employed personnel utilizing material of a worth not exceeding three hundred thousand dollars in value without a contract. This limit on the value of material being utilized in work being performed by regularly employed personnel shall not include the value of individual items of equipment. For the purposes of this section, the term "equipment" includes but is not limited to conductor, cabling, wire, pipe, or lines used for electrical, water, fiber optic, or telecommunications.

3. Before awarding a contract required under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the commission shall publish a notice once or more in a newspaper of general circulation in the district at least thirteen days before the last date upon which bids will be received, inviting sealed proposals for the work or materials. Plans and specifications for the work or materials shall at the time of publication be on file at the office of the district and subject to public inspection. Any published notice ordering work to be performed for the district shall be mailed at the time of publication to any established trade association which files a written request with the district to receive such notices. The commission may, at the same time and as part of the same notice, invite tenders for the work or materials upon plans and specifications to be submitted by the bidders.

4. As an alternative to the competitive bidding requirements of this section and RCW 54.04.080, a district may let contracts using the small works roster process under RCW 39.04.155.

5. Whenever equipment or materials required by a district are held by a governmental agency and are available for sale but such agency is unwilling to submit a proposal, the commission may ascertain the price of such items and file a statement of such price supported by the sworn affidavit of one member of the commission, and may consider such price as a bid without a deposit or bond.

6. Pursuant to RCW 39.04.280, the commission may waive the competitive bidding requirements of this section and RCW 54.04.080 if an exemption contained within RCW 39.04.280 applies to the purchase or public work.

7. [Empty]

   a. A district may procure public works with a unit priced contract under this section, RCW 54.04.080, or 54.04.085 for the purpose of completing anticipated types of work based on hourly rates or unit pricing for one or more categories of work or trades.

   b. For the purposes of this section, unit priced contract means a competitively bid contract in which public works are anticipated on a recurring basis to meet the business or operational needs of a district, under which the contractor agrees to a fixed period indefinite quantity delivery of work, at a defined unit price, for each category of work.

   c. Unit priced contracts must be executed for an initial contract term not to exceed three years, with the district having the option of extending or renewing the unit priced contract for one additional year.

   d.

Any notice inviting sealed bids shall state generally the work to be done, or the material to be purchased and shall call for proposals for furnishing it, to be sealed and filed with the commission on or before the time named therein. Each bid shall be accompanied by a certified or cashier's check, payable to the order of the commission, for a sum not less than five percent of the amount of the bid, or accompanied by a bid bond in an amount not less than five percent of the bid with a corporate surety licensed to do business in the state, conditioned that the bidder will pay the district as liquidated damages the amount specified in the bond unless he or she enters into a contract in accordance with his or her bid and furnishes the performance bond within ten days from the date on which he or she is notified that he or she is the successful bidder. A low bidder who claims error and fails to enter into a contract is prohibited from bidding on the same project if a second or subsequent call for bids is made for the project.

At the time and place named, the bids shall be publicly opened and read, and the commission shall canvass the bids, and may let the contract to the lowest responsible bidder upon the plans and specifications on file, or to the best bidder submitting his or her own plans or specifications; or if the contract to be let is to construct or improve electrical facilities, the contract may be let to the lowest bidder prequalified according to the provisions of RCW 54.04.085 upon the plans and specifications on file, or to the best bidder submitting his or her own plans and specifications: PROVIDED, That no contract shall be let for more than fifteen percent in excess of the estimated cost of the materials or work.
