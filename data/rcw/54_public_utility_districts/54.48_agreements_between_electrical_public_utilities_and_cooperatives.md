## 54.48.020 - Legislative declaration of policy.
The legislature hereby declares that the duplication of the electric lines and service of public utilities and cooperatives is uneconomical, may create unnecessary hazards to the public safety, discourages investment in permanent underground facilities, and is unattractive, and thus is contrary to the public interest and further declares that it is in the public interest for public utilities and cooperatives to enter into agreements for the purpose of avoiding or eliminating such duplication.

\[ [1969 c 102 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1969c102.pdf?cite=1969%20c%20102%20§%202); \]

## 54.48.040 - Cooperatives not to be classified as public utilities or under authority of utilities and transportation commission.
