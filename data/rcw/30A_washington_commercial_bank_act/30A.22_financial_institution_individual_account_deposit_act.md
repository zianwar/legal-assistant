## 30A.22.010 - Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the financial institution individual account deposit act.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%201); \]

## 30A.22.020 - Purposes.
The purposes of this chapter are:

1. To provide a consistent law applicable to all financial institutions authorized to accept deposits from individuals with respect to payments by the institutions to individuals claiming rights to the deposited funds; and

2. To qualify and simplify the law concerning the respective ownership interests of individuals to funds held on deposit by financial institutions, both as to the relationship between the individual depositors and beneficiaries of an account, and to the financial institution-depositor-beneficiary relationships; and

3. To simplify and make consistent the law pertaining to payments by financial institutions of deposited funds both before and after the death of a depositor or depositors, including provisions for the validity and effect of certain nontestamentary transfers of deposits upon the death of one or more depositors.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%202); \]

## 30A.22.030 - Construction.
When construing sections and provisions of this chapter, the sections and provisions shall:

1. Be liberally construed and applied to promote the purposes of the chapter; and

2. Be considered part of a general act which is intended as unified coverage of the subject matter, and no part of the chapter shall be deemed impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation if such construction can be reasonably avoided; and

3. Not be held invalid because of the invalidity of other sections or provisions of the chapter as long as the section or provision in question can be given effect without regard to the invalid section or provision, and to this end the sections and provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable; and

4. Not be construed by reference to section or subsection headings as used in the chapter since these do not constitute any part of the law; and

5. Not be deemed to alter the community or separate property nature of any funds held on deposit by a financial institution or any individual's community or separate property rights thereto, and a depositor's community and/or separate property rights to funds on deposit shall not be affected by the form of the account; and

6. Not be construed as authorizing or extending the authority of any financial institution to accept deposits or to permit a financial institution to accept deposits from such persons or entities or upon such terms as would contravene any other applicable federal or state law.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%203); \]

## 30A.22.040 - Definitions.
Unless the context of this chapter otherwise requires, the terms contained in this section have the meanings indicated.

1. "Account" means a contract of deposit between a depositor or depositors and a financial institution; the term includes a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit, savings certificate, share account, savings bond, and other like arrangements.

2. "Actual knowledge" means written notice to a manager of a branch of a financial institution, or an officer of the financial institution in the course of his or her employment at the branch, pertaining to funds held on deposit in an account maintained by the branch received within a period of time which affords the financial institution a reasonable opportunity to act upon the knowledge.

3. "Agency account" means an account to which funds may be deposited and from which payments may be made by an agent designated by a depositor. In the event there is more than one depositor named on an account, each depositor may designate the same or a different agent for the purpose of depositing to or making payments of funds from a depositor's account.

4. "Agent" means a person designated by a depositor or depositors in a contract of deposit or other document to have the authority to deposit and to make payments from an account in the name of the depositor or depositors.

5. "Depositor," when utilized in determining the rights of individuals to funds in an account, means an individual who owns the funds. When utilized in determining the rights of a financial institution to make or withhold payment, and/or to take any other action with regard to funds held under a contract of deposit, "depositor" means the individual or individuals who have the current right to payment of funds held under the contract of deposit without regard to the actual rights of ownership thereof by these individuals. A trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary becomes a depositor only when the account becomes payable to the beneficiary by reason of having survived the depositor or depositors named on the account, depending upon the provisions of the contract of deposit.

6. "Depositor's funds" or "funds of a depositor" means the amount of all deposits belonging to or made for the benefit of a depositor, less all withdrawals of the funds by the depositor or by others for the depositor's benefit, plus the depositor's prorated share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance of the account and any proceeds of deposit life insurance added to the account by reason of the death of a depositor.

7. "Director" means the director of the department of financial institutions or his or her designee.

8. "Financial institution" means a bank, trust company, mutual savings bank, savings and loan association, or credit union authorized to do business and accept deposits in this state under state or federal law.

9. "Individual" means a human being; "person" includes an individual, corporation, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, trust, or other entity recognized by law to have separate legal powers.

10. "Joint account with right of survivorship" means an account in the name of two or more depositors and which provides that the funds of a deceased depositor become the property of one or more of the surviving depositors.

11. "Joint account without right of survivorship" means an account in the name of two or more depositors and which contains no provision that the funds of a deceased depositor become the property of the surviving depositor or depositors.

12. "Payment(s)" of sums on deposit includes withdrawal, payment by check or other directive of a depositor or his or her agent, any pledge of sums on deposit by a depositor or his or her agent, any set-off or reduction or other disposition of all or part of an account balance, and any payments to any person under RCW 30A.22.120, 30A.22.140, 30A.22.150, 30A.22.160, 30A.22.170, 30A.22.180, 30A.22.190, 30A.22.200, and 30A.22.220.

13. "Promotional contest of chance" means a promotional contest conducted pursuant to RCW 9.46.0356(1)(b).

14. "Proof of death" means a certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate, or photostatic copy thereof, purporting to be issued by an official or agency of the jurisdiction where the death purportedly occurred, or a certified or authenticated copy of a record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that a person is dead. In either case, the proofs constitute prima facie proof of the fact, place, date, and time of death, and identity of the decedent and the status of the dates, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report.

15. "Request" means a request for withdrawal, or a check or order for payment, which complies with all conditions of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the financial institution; but if the financial institution conditions withdrawal or payment on advance notice, for purposes of this chapter the request for withdrawal or payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for withdrawal.

16. "Single account" means an account in the name of one depositor only.

17. "Trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary" means a person or persons, other than a codepositor, who has or have been designated by a depositor or depositors to receive the depositor's funds remaining in an account upon the death of a depositor or all depositors.

18. "Trust and P.O.D. accounts" means accounts payable on request to a depositor during the depositor's lifetime, and upon the depositor's death to one or more designated beneficiaries, or which are payable to two or more depositors during their lifetimes, and upon the death of all depositors to one or more designated beneficiaries. The term "trust account" does not include deposits by trustees or other fiduciaries where the trust or fiduciary relationship is established other than by a contract of deposit with a financial institution.

19. "Withdrawal" means payment to a person pursuant to check or other directive of a depositor.

In each case, the type of account shall be determined by the terms of the contract of deposit between the depositor and the financial institution. The financial institution shall describe to a potential depositor the various types of accounts available.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%205); \]

## 30A.22.060 - Requirements of contract of deposit.
The contract of deposit shall be in writing and signed by all individuals who have a current right to payment of funds from an account. The designation of an agent, or trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary by a depositor of a joint account without right of survivorship, or the designation of an agent by a depositor of a joint account with right of survivorship or by a depositor of a trust or P.O.D. account does not require the signature of a codepositor. A financial institution may insert such additional terms and conditions in a contract of deposit as it deems appropriate.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%206); \]

## 30A.22.070 - Accounts of minors and incompetents.
A minor or incompetent may enter into a valid and enforceable contract of deposit with the financial institution and any account in the name of a minor or incompetent shall, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of a different intention at the time it is created, be held for the exclusive right and benefit of the minor or incompetent free from the control of all other persons.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%207); \]

## 30A.22.080 - Accounts of married persons.
A financial institution may enter into a contract of deposit without regard to whether the depositor is married and without regard as to whether the funds on deposit are the community or separate property of the depositor.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%208); \]

## 30A.22.090 - Ownership of funds during lifetime of depositor.
Subject to community property rights, during the lifetime of a depositor, or the joint lifetimes of depositors:

1. Funds on deposit in a single account belong to the depositor.

2. Funds on deposit in a joint account without right of survivorship and in a joint account with right of survivorship belong to the depositors in proportion to the net funds owned by each depositor on deposit in the account, unless the contract of deposit provides otherwise or there is clear and convincing evidence of a contrary intent at the time the account was created.

3. Funds on deposit in a trust or P.O.D. account belong to the depositor and not to the trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary or beneficiaries; if two or more depositors are named on the trust or P.O.D. account, their rights of ownership to the funds on deposit in the account are governed by subsection (2) of this section.

4. Ownership of funds on deposit in an agency account shall be determined in accordance with subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section depending upon whether the principal is a depositor on a single account, joint account, joint account with right of survivorship, or trust or P.O.D. account.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%209); \]

## 30A.22.100 - Ownership of funds after death of a depositor.
Subject to community property rights and subject to the terms and provisions of any community property agreement, upon the death of a depositor:

1. Funds which remain on deposit in a single account belong to the depositor's estate.

2. Funds belonging to a deceased depositor which remain on deposit in a joint account without right of survivorship belong to the depositor's estate, unless the depositor has also designated a trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary of the depositor's interest in the account.

3. Funds belonging to a deceased depositor which remain on deposit in a joint account with right of survivorship belong to the surviving depositors unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a contrary intent at the time the account was created. If there is more than one individual having right of survivorship, the funds belong equally to the surviving depositors unless the contract of deposit otherwise provides. If there is more than one surviving depositor, the rights of survivorship shall continue between the surviving depositors.

4. Funds remaining on deposit in a trust or P.O.D. account belong to the trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary designated by the deceased depositor unless the account has also been designated as a joint account with right of survivorship, in which event the funds remaining on deposit in the account do not belong to the trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary until the death of the last surviving depositor and the rights of the surviving depositors shall be determined by subsection (3) of this section. If the deceased depositor has designated more than one trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary, and more than one of the beneficiaries survive the depositor, the funds belong equally to the surviving beneficiaries unless the depositor has specifically designated a different method of distribution in the contract of deposit; if two or more beneficiaries survive, there is no right of survivorship as between them unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for rights of survivorship between the beneficiaries.

5. Upon the death of a depositor of an agency account, the agency shall terminate and any funds remaining on deposit belonging to the deceased depositor shall become the property of the depositor's estate or such other persons who may be entitled thereto, depending upon whether the account was a single account, joint account, joint account with right of survivorship, or a trust or P.O.D. account.

Any transfers to surviving depositors or to trust or P.O.D. account beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of this section are declared to be effective by reason of the provisions of the account contracts involved and this chapter and are not to be considered as testamentary dispositions. The rights of survivorship and of trust and P.O.D. account beneficiaries arise from the express terms of the contract of deposit and cannot, under any circumstances, be changed by the will of a depositor.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%2010); \]

## 30A.22.110 - Controversies between owners.
*RCW 30.22.090 and 30.22.100 are intended to establish ownership of funds on deposit in the accounts stated, as between depositors and/or trust or P.O.D. account beneficiaries, and the provisions thereof are relevant only as to controversies between such persons and their creditors, and other successors, and have no bearing on the power of any person to receive payment of funds maintained in the accounts or the right of a financial institution to make payments to any person as provided by the terms of the contract of deposit.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%2011); \]

## 30A.22.120 - Right to rely on form of account—Discharge of financial institutions.
In making payments of funds deposited in an account, a financial institution may rely conclusively and entirely upon the form of the account and the terms of the contract of deposit at the time the payments are made. A financial institution is not required to inquire as to either the source or the ownership of any funds received for deposit to an account, or to the proposed application of any payments made from an account. Unless a financial institution has actual knowledge of the existence of dispute between depositors, beneficiaries, or other persons claiming an interest in funds deposited in an account, all payments made by a financial institution from an account at the request of any depositor to the account and/or the agent of any depositor to the account in accordance with this section and RCW 30A.22.140, 30A.22.150, 30A.22.160, 30A.22.170, 30A.22.180, 30A.22.190, 30A.22.200, and 30A.22.220 shall constitute a complete release and discharge of the financial institution from all claims for the amounts so paid regardless of whether or not the payment is consistent with the actual ownership of the funds deposited in an account by a depositor and/or the actual ownership of the funds as between depositors and/or the beneficiaries of P.O.D. and trust accounts, and/or their heirs, successors, personal representatives, and assigns.

\[ [2014 c 37 § 196](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6135.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%2037%20§%20196); [1981 c 192 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%2012); \]

## 30A.22.130 - Rights as between individuals preserved.
The protection accorded to financial institutions under RCW 30A.22.120, 30A.22.140, 30A.22.150, 30A.22.160, 30A.22.170, 30A.22.180, 30A.22.190, 30A.22.200, 30A.22.210, and 30A.22.220 shall have no bearing on the actual rights of ownership to deposited funds by a depositor, and/or between depositors, and/or by and between beneficiaries of trust and P.O.D. accounts, and their heirs, successors, personal representatives, and assigns.

\[ [2014 c 37 § 197](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6135.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%2037%20§%20197); [1981 c 192 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%2013); \]

## 30A.22.140 - Payment of funds to a depositor.
Payments of funds on deposit in a single account may be made by a financial institution to or for the depositor regardless of whether the depositor is, in fact, the actual owner of the funds. Payments of funds on deposit in an account having two or more depositors may be made by a financial institution to or for any one or more of the depositors named on the account without regard to the actual ownership of the funds by or between the depositors, and without regard to whether any other depositor or depositors so named are deceased or incompetent at the time the payments are made.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%2014); \]

## 30A.22.150 - Payment to minors and incompetents.
Financial institutions may make payments of funds on deposit in an account established by a depositor who is a minor or incompetent without regard to whether it has actual knowledge of the minority or incompetency of the depositor unless the branch of the financial institution at which the account is maintained has received written notice to withhold payment to the minor or incompetent by the guardian of his or her estate and had a reasonable opportunity to act upon the notice.

\[ [2011 c 336 § 748](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5045.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20336%20§%20748); [1981 c 192 § 15](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%2015); \]

## 30A.22.160 - Payment to trust and P.O.D. account beneficiaries.
Financial institutions may pay any funds remaining on deposit in an account to a trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary or beneficiaries when the financial institution has received proofs of death of all depositors to the account who pursuant to the terms of the contract of deposit were required to predecease the beneficiary. If there is more than one trust or P.O.D. account beneficiary, financial institutions shall not, unless the contract of deposit otherwise provides, pay to any one such beneficiary more than that amount which is obtained by dividing the total of the funds on deposit in the account by the number of trust or P.O.D. account beneficiaries.

\[ [1981 c 192 § 16](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c192.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20192%20§%2016); \]

## 30A.22.170 - Payment to agents of depositors.
Any funds on deposit in an account may be paid by a financial institution to or upon the order of any agent of any depositor.
