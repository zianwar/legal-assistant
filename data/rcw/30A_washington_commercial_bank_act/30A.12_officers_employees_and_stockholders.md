## 30A.12.025 - Rights of shareholder to examine and make extracts of records—Penalty—Financial statements.
Any person who has been a shareholder of record at least six months immediately preceding his or her demand or who is the holder of record of at least five percent of all the outstanding shares of a bank, upon written demand stating the purpose thereof, has the right to examine, in person, or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable time or times, for any proper purpose, the bank's minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders, its shareholder records, and its existing publicly available records. The person is entitled to make extracts therefrom, except that the person is not entitled to view or make extracts of any portion of minutes that refer or relate to information which is confidential.

Any officer or agent who, or a bank that, refuses to allow any such shareholder or his or her agent or attorney, to examine and make extracts from its minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders, record of shareholders, or existing publicly available books and records, for any proper purpose, shall be liable to the shareholder for actual damages or other remedy afforded the shareholder by law.

It is a defense to any action for penalties under this section that the person suing therefor has, within two years: (1) Sold or offered for sale any list of shareholders for shares of such bank or any other bank; (2) aided or abetted any person in procuring any list of shareholders for any such purpose; (3) improperly used any information secured through any prior examination of existing publicly available books and records, or minutes, or record of shareholders of such bank or any other bank; or (4) not acted in good faith or for a proper purpose in making his or her demand.

Nothing in this section impairs the power of any court of competent jurisdiction, upon proof by a shareholder of proper purpose, irrespective of the period of time during which the shareholder has been a shareholder of record, and irrespective of the number of shares held by him or her, to compel the production for examination by the shareholder of the existing publicly available books and records, minutes, and record of shareholders of a bank.

Upon the written request of any shareholder of a bank, the bank shall mail to the shareholder its most recent financial statements showing in reasonable detail its assets and liabilities and the results of its operations. As used in this section, "shareholder" includes the holder of voting trust certificates for shares.

Such bonds may be individual, schedule or blanket form, and the premiums therefor shall be paid by the bank.

2. The said directors shall also direct and require suitable insurance protection to the bank against burglary, robbery, theft and other similar insurance hazards to which the bank may be exposed in the operations of its business on the premises or elsewhere.

The said directors shall be responsible for prescribing at least once in each year the amount or penal sum of such bonds or policies and the sureties or underwriters thereon, after giving due consideration to all known elements and factors constituting such risk or hazard. Such action shall be recorded in the minutes of the board of directors.

## 30A.12.115 - Transactions in which director or officer has an interest.
1. If a transaction is fair to a corporation at the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified, the fact that a director or an officer had a direct or indirect interest in the transaction is not grounds for either invalidating the transaction or imposing liability on the director or officer.

2. In any proceeding seeking to invalidate a transaction with the corporation in which a director or an officer had a direct or indirect interest in a transaction with the corporation, the person asserting the validity of the transaction has the burden of proving fairness unless:

   a. The material facts of the transaction and the director's or officer's interest was disclosed or known to the board of directors, or a committee of the board, and the board or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction; or

   b. The material facts of the transaction and the director's or officer's interest was disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote, and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.

3. For purposes of this section, a director or an officer of a corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction with the corporation if:

   a. Another entity in which the director or officer has a material financial interest, or in which such person is a general partner, is a party to the transaction; or

   b. Another entity of which the director or officer is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction, and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.

4. For purposes of *subsection (3)(a) of this section, a transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified only if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors or on the committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under *subsection (3)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in that subsection.

5. For purposes of *subsection (3)(b) of this section, a transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified only if it receives the vote of a majority of shares entitled to be counted under this subsection. All outstanding shares entitled to vote under this title or the articles of incorporation are entitled to be counted under this subsection except shares owned by or voted under the control of a director or an officer who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction. Shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (3)(a) of this section shall not be counted to determine whether shareholders have authorized, approved, or ratified a transaction for purposes of *subsection (3)(b) of this section. The vote of the shares owned by or voted under the control of a director or an officer who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction and shares owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (3)(a) of this section, however, shall be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this title and for purposes of determining a quorum.

## 30A.12.180 - Levy of assessments.
Whenever the director shall notify the board of directors of a bank to levy an assessment upon the stock of such corporation and the holders of two-thirds of the stock shall consent thereto, such board shall, within ten days from the issuance of such notice, adopt a resolution for the levy of such assessment, and shall immediately upon the adoption of such resolution serve notice upon each stockholder, personally or by mail, at his or her last known address, to pay such assessment; and that if the same be not paid within twenty days from the date of the issuance of such notice, his or her stock will be subject to sale and all amounts previously paid thereon shall be subject to forfeiture. If any stockholder fail within said twenty days to pay the assessment as provided in this section, it shall be the duty of the board of directors to cause a sufficient amount of the capital stock of such stockholder to be sold to make good the deficiency. The sale shall be held at such time and place as shall be designated by the board of directors and shall be either public or private, as the board shall deem best. At any time after the expiration of sixty days from the expiration of said twenty-day period the director may require any stock upon which the assessment remains unpaid to be canceled and deducted from the capital of the corporation. If such cancellation shall reduce the capital of the corporation below the minimum required by this title or its articles of incorporation the capital shall, within thirty days thereafter be increased to the required amount by original subscription, in default of which the director may take possession of such corporation in the manner provided by law in case of insolvency.
