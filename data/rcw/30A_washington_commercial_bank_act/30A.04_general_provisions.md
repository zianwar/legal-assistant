## 30A.04.002 - Short title.
This title may be known and cited as the Washington commercial bank act.

\[ [2014 c 37 § 101](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6135.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%2037%20§%20101); \]

## 30A.04.005 - Legislative declarations.
The legislature declares that:

1. Banking institutions and trust companies provide essential and valuable fiduciary management services to consumers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in the state of Washington;

2. There is a critical public need to encourage and promote the revitalization and growth of the state's financial sector and realize its potential as an alternative global financial services hub;

3. The fulfillment of this potential can best be achieved by taking measures to:

   a. Clarify prudential standards of professional fiduciary management to provide assurances to state, national, and international owners and managers of wealth;

   b. Promote flexibility in the management of asset portfolios to respond to ever changing global conditions; and

   c. Provide certainty and clear expectations for owners of wealth, asset managers, and their respective advisors;

4. Banking institutions and nondepositary trust companies in the state of Washington will be better prepared to continue providing professional fiduciary management services effectively if laws of the state's banking institutions and nondepositary trust companies are modernized, clarified, reorganized and, with respect to some situations, amended;

5. There is a need for improved services and reduced costs for trust institution clients and customers and other consumers in this state through modernization of state law to clarify and thereby promote the delegation by trust institutions of fiduciary functions to qualified third-party professionals, to authorize clients to designate any trust institution to act for them, and to protect the public from excessive fees or undisclosed conflicts of interest of trust institutions and their affiliates;

6. Properly capitalized and professionally managed trusts and trust companies serving only family members and their affiliated entities, which operate privately and do not hold themselves out to, nor provide services to, the general public, should continue to operate without the necessity of being chartered or regulated by the department of financial institutions;

7. The authority of the department of financial institutions needs to be clarified, preserved, and assured as the primary instrument of assuring the safety and soundness of banking institutions and nondepositary trust companies acting as fiduciaries and engaging in trust business in this state;

8. Nondepository trust companies should continue to act as fiduciaries and otherwise engage in trust business in this state, so long as they are properly capitalized, competently managed by persons of integrity, and supervised by the department of financial institutions so as to ensure that such trust companies are operated in compliance with law, in a safe and sound manner, and in a manner which protects trust settlors, trust beneficiaries, and the general public in this state; and

9. The creation of a comprehensive trust institutions act serves the convenience and advantage of Washington state trust settlors and trust beneficiaries, and the state's general public, and preserves and maintains the fairness of competition and parity between Washington state-chartered banking institutions and trust companies, and federally chartered and out-of-state state-chartered banking institutions and trust companies.

## 30A.04.017 - Director's subpoenas—Unauthorized banking activity.
1. The director or authorized assistants may apply for and obtain a superior court order approving and authorizing a subpoena in advance of its issuance. The application may be made in the county where the subpoenaed person resides or is found, or the county where the subpoenaed documents, records, or evidence are located, or in Thurston county. The application must:

   b. Adequately specify the documents, records, evidence, or testimony; and

   c. Include a declaration made under oath that an investigation is being conducted for a lawfully authorized purpose related to an investigation within the department's authority and that the subpoenaed documents, records, evidence, or testimony are reasonably related to an investigation within the department's authority.

2. When an application under this section is made to the satisfaction of the court, the court must issue an order approving the subpoena. An order under this subsection constitutes authority of law for the agency to subpoena the documents, records, evidence, or testimony.

3. The director or authorized assistants may seek approval and a court may issue an order under this section without prior notice to any person, including the person to whom the subpoena is directed and the person who is the subject of an investigation. An application for court approval is subject to the fee and process set forth in RCW 36.18.012(3).

## 30A.04.020 - Use of words indicating bank or trust company—Penalty.
1. The name of every bank shall contain the word "bank" and the name of every trust company shall contain the word "trust," or the word "bank." Except as provided in RCW 33.08.030 or as otherwise authorized by this section or approved by the director, only a national bank, federal savings bank, a bank or trust company, savings bank under Title 32 RCW, bank holding company or financial holding company, a holding company authorized by this title or Title 32 RCW, or a foreign or alien corporation or other legal person authorized by this title to do so, shall:

   a. Use as a part of his or her or its name or other business designation, as a prominent syllable within a word comprising all or a portion of its name or other business designation, or in any manner as if connected with his or her or its business or place of business any of the following words or the plural thereof, to wit: "bank," "banking," "banker," "bancorporation," "bancorp," or "trust," or any foreign language designations thereof, including, by way of example, "banco" or "banque."

   b. Use any sign, logo, or marketing message, in any media, or use any letterhead, billhead, note, receipt, certificate, blank, form, or any written, printed, electronic or internet-based instrument or material representation whatsoever, directly or indirectly indicating that the business of such person is that of a bank or trust company.

2. A foreign corporation or other foreign domiciled legal person, whose name contains the words "bank," "banker," "banking," "bancorporation," "bancorp," or "trust," or the foreign language equivalent thereof, or whose articles of incorporation empower it to engage in banking or to engage in a trust business, may not engage in banking or in a trust business in this state unless the corporation or other legal person (a) is expressly authorized to do so under this title, under federal law, or by the director, and (b) complies with all applicable requirements of Washington state law regarding foreign corporations and other foreign legal persons. If an activity would not constitute "transacting business" within the meaning of RCW 23B.15.010(1) or chapter 23B.18 RCW, then the activity shall not constitute banking or engaging in a trust business. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent operations by an alien bank in compliance with chapter 30A.42 RCW.

3.

8. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or other applicable law, a bank, trust company, alien bank, or holding company is not in violation of this section on account of its compliance with required reporting to the federal securities and exchange commission, including the disclosure of any order of the director.

## 30A.04.111 - Limit on loans and extensions of credit to one person—Exceptions—Definitions—Rules—Nonconforming loans and extensions of credit.
1. The total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to a person outstanding at any one time shall not exceed twenty percent of the capital and surplus of such bank. A loan or extension of credit made by a bank does not violate this section if the loan or extension of credit would qualify for an exception to the lending limit for a national bank under rules adopted by the United States office of the comptroller of the currency, or successor federal agency with authority over national banks and federal savings associations.

2. For the purposes of this section, the terms "borrower," "capital and surplus," "derivative transaction," "loans and extensions of credit," and "person" shall have the same meaning as those terms are defined in section 32.2 of Title 12 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, 12 C.F.R. Sec. 32.2, except that "loans and extensions of credit" also includes repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or securities borrowing transactions between a bank and a borrower if the federal deposit insurance corporation requires such treatment for a state insured bank or the board of governors of the federal reserve system requires such treatment for member state banks.

3. The director may prescribe rules to administer and carry out the purposes of this section, including without limitation rules (a) to define or further define terms used in this section, (b) to establish limits or requirements other than those specified in this section for particular classes or categories of loans and extensions of credit, (c) to determine when a loan putatively made to a person shall, for purposes of this section, be attributed to another person, (d) to set standards for computation of time in relation to determining limits on loans and extensions of credit, and (e) to implement and incorporate other changes in limits on loans and extensions of credit necessary to conform to federal statute and rule required or otherwise authorized by this section. In adopting the rules, the director shall be guided by rulings of the United States comptroller of the currency, or successor federal banking regulator, that govern limits on loans and extensions of credit applicable to national banks and federal savings associations. In lieu of the adoption by the department of a rule applicable to specific types of transactions, a bank, unless otherwise approved by the director, shall conform to all applicable rulings of the comptroller of the currency, or successor federal banking regulator, which (i) relate to national banks and federal savings associations, (ii) govern such specific types of transactions or circumstances, and (iii) are consistent with this section and the department's adopted rules.

4. [Empty]

   a. A loan or extension of credit that was within the limit on loans and extensions of credit when made is not a violation but will be treated as nonconforming if the loan or extension of credit is no longer in conformity with the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit because:

      i. The bank's capital has declined, borrowers have subsequently merged or formed a common enterprise, lenders have merged, or the limit on loans and extensions of credit or capital rules have changed; or

      ii. Collateral securing the loan or extension of credit, in order to satisfy the requirements of an exception to the limit, has declined in value.

   b. A bank shall make reasonable efforts to bring a loan or extension of credit that is nonconforming under (a)(i) of this subsection into conformity with the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit unless to do so would be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.

   c. A bank must bring a loan or extension of credit that is nonconforming under (a)(ii) of this subsection into conformity with the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit within thirty calendar days, except when judicial proceedings, regulatory actions, or other extraordinary circumstances beyond the bank's control prevent the bank or trust company from taking action.

   d. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (4), the director may by rule or interpretation prescribe standards for treatment of nonconforming extensions of credit that are derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or securities borrowing transactions, and may, if required for state insured banks or member state banks, rely upon rules or interpretations of the federal deposit insurance corporation or the board of governors of the federal reserve system, as applicable.

5. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, in the event that a bank's capital declines sufficiently to seriously impair the bank's ability to effectively operate in its marketplace or serve the needs of its customers or the community in which it is located, the director may, upon written application and in the exercise of the director's discretion, grant the bank temporary permission to fund loans and extensions of credit in excess of the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit under this section. In the exercise of discretion, the director may further specify conditions for granting such emergency exception and may limit emergency lending authority under this section to particular types or classes of loans and extensions of credit.

6. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the director, in the exercise of discretion, may grant an exception to the limit on loans and extensions of credit otherwise required by this section, based on extenuating facts and circumstances. In deciding whether to grant an exception under this subsection, the director shall consider:

   a. The proposed transaction for which the exception is sought;

   b. How the requested exception would affect the capital adequacy and safety and soundness of the requesting bank if the exception is not granted or, if the exception is granted, if the proposed borrower should ultimately default;

   c. How the requested exception would affect the loan portfolio diversification of the requesting bank;

   d. The competency of management to handle the proposed transaction and any resulting safety and soundness issues;

   e. The marketability and value of the proposed collateral; and

   f. The extenuating facts and circumstances that warrant an exception in light of the purpose of limit on loans and extensions of credit set forth in this section.

## 30A.04.215 - Engaging in other business activities.
1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, in addition to all powers enumerated by this title, and those necessarily implied therefrom, a bank may engage in other business activities that have been determined by the board of governors of the federal reserve system or by the United States Congress to be closely related to the business of banking, as of July 28, 2013.

2. A bank that desires to perform an activity that is not expressly authorized by subsection (1) of this section shall first apply to the director for authorization to conduct such activity. Within thirty days of the receipt of this application, the director shall determine whether the activity is closely related to the business of banking, whether the public convenience and advantage will be promoted, whether the activity is apt to create an unsafe and unsound practice by the bank and whether the applicant is capable of performing such an activity. If the director finds the activity to be closely related to the business of banking and the bank is otherwise qualified, he or she shall immediately inform the applicant that the activity is authorized. If the director determines that such activity is not closely related to the business of banking or that the bank is not otherwise qualified, he or she shall promptly inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have the right to appeal from an unfavorable determination in accordance with the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, chapter 34.05 RCW. In determining whether a particular activity is closely related to the business of banking, the director shall be guided by the rulings of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the comptroller of the currency in making determinations in connection with the powers exercisable by bank holding companies, and the activities performed by other commercial banks or their holding companies.

3. Notwithstanding any restrictions, limitations, and requirements of law, in addition to all powers, express or implied, that a bank has under the laws of this state, a bank shall have the powers and authorities conferred as of July 28, 1985, or as of any subsequent date not later than July 28, 2013, upon any federally chartered bank doing business in this state. A bank may exercise the powers and authorities conferred on a federally chartered bank after July 28, 2013, only if the director finds that the exercise of such powers and authorities:

   a. Serves the convenience and advantage of depositors, borrowers, or the general public; and

   b. Maintains the fairness of competition and parity between state-chartered banks and federally chartered banks.

4. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, a bank has the powers and authorities that an out-of-state state bank operating a branch in Washington has if the director finds that the exercise of such powers and authorities serves the convenience and advantage of depositors and borrowers, or the general public, and maintains the fairness of competition and parity between state-chartered banks and out-of-state state banks.

5. As used in this section, "powers and authorities" include without limitation powers and authorities in corporate governance and operational matters.

6. The restrictions, limitations, and requirements applicable to specific powers and authorities of federally chartered banks and out-of-state state banks, as applicable, shall apply to banks exercising those powers and authorities permitted under this section but only insofar as the restrictions, limitations, and requirements relate to exercising the powers and authorities granted banks solely under this section.

7. The director may require a bank to provide notice to the director prior to implementation of a plan to develop, improve, or continue holding real estate, including capitalized and operating leases, acquired through any means in full or partial satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, under circumstances which a national bank would be required to provide notice to the comptroller of the currency prior to implementation of such a plan. The director may adopt rules or issue orders, directives, standards, policies, memoranda, or other official communications to specify guidance with regard to the exercise of the powers and authorities to expend such funds as are needed to enable a bank to recover its total investment to the fullest extent authorized for a national bank under the national bank act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 29.

8. Any activity which may be performed by a bank, except the taking of deposits, may be performed by (a) a corporation or (b) another entity approved by the director, which in either case is owned in whole or in part by the bank.

4. Any such acquisition referred to under subsection (2) of this section by an out-of-state bank holding company requires the express written approval of the director. Approval shall not be granted unless and until the following conditions are met:

   a. An out-of-state bank holding company desiring to make an acquisition referred to under subsection (2) of this section and the bank, national banking association, or domestic bank holding company parent thereof, if any, proposed to be acquired shall file an application in writing with the director.

      i. The bank or national banking association that is proposed to be acquired or the domestic bank holding company controlling such bank or national banking association is in such a liquidity or financial condition as to be in danger of closing, failing, or insolvency. In making any such determination the director shall be guided by the criteria developed by the federal regulatory agencies with respect to emergency acquisitions under the provisions of 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1828(c);

      ii. There is no state bank or national banking association doing business in the state of Washington or domestic bank holding company with sufficient resources willing to acquire the entire bank or national banking association on at least as favorable terms as the out-of-state bank holding company is willing to acquire it;

      iii. The applicant out-of-state bank holding company has provided all information and documents requested by the director in relation to the application; and

      iv. The applicant out-of-state bank holding company has demonstrated an acceptable record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution.
