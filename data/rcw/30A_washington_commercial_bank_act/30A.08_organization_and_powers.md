5. [Empty]

   a. Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 25.15 RCW or this section to the contrary, all voting members remain liable and responsible as fiduciaries of a bank or holding company organized as a limited liability company, regardless of resignation, dissociation, or disqualification, to the same extent that directors of a bank or holding company organized as a corporation would be or remain liable or responsible to the department and applicable federal banking regulators; and

   b. If death, incapacity, or disqualification of all members of the limited liability company would result in a complete dissociation of all members, then the bank, holding company, or both, as applicable is deemed nonetheless to remain in existence for purposes of the department or an applicable federal regulator, or both, having standing under RCW 30A.44.270 or applicable federal law, or both, to exercise the powers and authorities of a receiver for the bank or holding company.

Otherwise the director shall notify the applicant that he or she refuses to grant such certificate. The applicant may appeal from such refusal in the same manner as in the case of a refusal to grant an original certificate of authority. Otherwise the determination of the director shall be conclusive.

Should any bank fail to continue its existence in the manner herein provided and be not previously dissolved, the director shall at the end of its original term of existence immediately take possession thereof and wind up the same in the same manner as in the case of insolvency.
