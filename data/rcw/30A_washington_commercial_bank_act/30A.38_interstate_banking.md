The provisions applicable to examinations and sharing of information of Washington state banks shall apply to these examinations.

2. The director may prescribe requirements for reports regarding any branches of an out-of-state bank that operates a branch in Washington pursuant to this chapter. The required reports shall be provided by the bank or by the bank supervisory agency having primary responsibility for the bank. Any reporting requirements prescribed by the director under this subsection shall be consistent with the reporting requirements applicable to Washington state banks and appropriate for the purpose of enabling the director to carry out his or her responsibilities under this chapter.

## 30A.38.070 - Out-of-state state bank becomes resulting bank—Branches in this state—RCW  30A.49.125(5) does not apply—When established and maintained—Notice to director.
1. Any out-of-state state bank that will be the resulting bank pursuant to an interstate combination involving any bank with branches in Washington, if RCW 30A.49.125(5) does not apply, shall notify the director of the proposed combination not later than three days after the date of filing of an application for the combination with the responsible federal bank supervisory agency, and shall submit a copy of the application to the director and pay applicable application fees, if any, required by the director. In lieu of notice from the out-of-state state bank the director may accept notice from the bank's home state regulator. The director has the authority to waive any procedures required by Washington merger laws if the director finds that the provision is in conflict with the applicable federal law or in conflict with the applicable law of the state of the resulting bank.

2. An out-of-state state bank that has established and maintains a branch in this state pursuant to this chapter shall give at least thirty days' prior written notice or, in the case of an emergency transaction, shorter notice as is consistent with the applicable state or federal law, to the director of any transaction that would cause a change of control with respect to the bank or any bank holding company that controls the bank, with the result that an application would be required to be filed pursuant to the federal change in bank control act of 1978, as amended, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1817(j), or the federal bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1841 et seq., or any successor statutes. In lieu of notice from the out-of-state state bank the director may accept notice from the bank's home state regulator.

## 30A.38.080 - Application of Washington laws—Declaration of invalidity.
1. The laws of Washington applicable to Washington state banks regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and the establishment of intrastate branches apply to any branch in Washington of an out-of-state national bank or out-of-state state bank to the same extent as Washington laws apply to a Washington state bank. In lieu of taking action directly against an out-of-state state bank to enforce compliance with these Washington laws on host state branches, the director may refer action to the home state regulator, but the director retains enforcement powers to ensure that compliance is satisfactory to the director.

2. Any host state branch of a Washington state bank shall comply with all applicable host state laws concerning community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and the establishment of intrastate branches.

3. In the event that the responsible federal chartering authority, pursuant to applicable federal law, or in the event a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any Washington state law is invalid with respect to an out-of-state or national bank, that Washington state law is also invalid with respect to Washington state banks and to host branches of out-of-state state banks to that same extent. The director may, from time to time, publish by rule Washington state laws that have been found invalidated pursuant to federal law and procedures. This subsection does not impair, in any manner, the authority of the state attorney general to enforce antitrust laws applicable to banks, bank holding companies, or affiliates of those banks or bank holding companies.
