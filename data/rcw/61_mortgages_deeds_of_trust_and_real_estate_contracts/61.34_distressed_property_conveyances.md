## 61.34.010 - Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that persons are engaging in patterns of conduct which defraud innocent homeowners of their equity interest or other value in residential dwellings under the guise of a purchase of the owner's residence but which is in fact a device to convert the owner's equity interest or other value in the residence to an equity skimmer, who fails to make payments, diverts the equity or other value to the skimmer's benefit, and leaves the innocent homeowner with a resulting financial loss or debt.

The legislature further finds this activity of equity skimming to be contrary to the public policy of this state and therefore establishes the crime of equity skimming to address this form of real estate fraud and abuse.

## 61.34.030 - Criminal penalty.
Any person who wilfully engages in a pattern of equity skimming is guilty of a class B felony under RCW 9A.20.021. Equity skimming shall be classified as a level II offense under chapter 9.94A RCW, and each act of equity skimming found beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant upon a plea of guilty to be included in the pattern of equity skimming, shall be a separate current offense for the purpose of determining the sentence range for each current offense pursuant to RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a).

\[ [1988 c 33 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c33.pdf?cite=1988%20c%2033%20§%202); \]

## 61.34.040 - Application of consumer protection act—Remedies are cumulative.
1. In addition to the criminal penalties provided in RCW 61.34.030, the legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying chapter 19.86 RCW.

2. In a private right of action under chapter 19.86 RCW for a violation of this chapter, the court may double or triple the award of damages pursuant to RCW 19.86.090, subject to the statutory limit. If, however, the court determines that the defendant acted in bad faith, the limit for doubling or tripling the award of damages may be increased, but shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars. Any claim for damages brought under this chapter must be commenced within four years after the date of the alleged violation.

3. The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not restrict any remedy that is otherwise available. The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive and are in addition to any other requirements, rights, remedies, and penalties provided by law. An action under this chapter shall not affect the rights in the distressed home held by a distressed home purchaser for value under this chapter or other applicable law.

## 61.34.120 - Distressed home purchaser—Prohibited practices.
A distressed home purchaser shall not:

1. Enter into, or attempt to enter into, a distressed home conveyance with a distressed homeowner unless the distressed home purchaser verifies and can demonstrate that the distressed homeowner has a reasonable ability to pay for the subsequent conveyance of an interest back to the distressed homeowner. In the case of a lease with an option to purchase, payment ability also includes the reasonable ability to make the lease payments and purchase the property within the term of the option to purchase. An evaluation of a distressed homeowner's reasonable ability to pay includes debt to income ratios, fair market value of the distressed home, and the distressed homeowner's payment and credit history. There is a rebuttable presumption that the distressed home purchaser has not verified a distressed homeowner's reasonable ability to pay if the distressed home purchaser has not obtained documentation of assets, liabilities, and income, other than an undocumented statement, of the distressed homeowner;

2. Fail to either:

   a. Ensure that title to the distressed home has been reconveyed to the distressed homeowner; or

   b. Make payment to the distressed homeowner so that the distressed homeowner has received consideration in an amount of at least eighty-two percent of the fair market value of the property as of the date of the eviction or voluntary relinquishment of possession of the distressed home by the distressed homeowner. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(b), the following applies:
