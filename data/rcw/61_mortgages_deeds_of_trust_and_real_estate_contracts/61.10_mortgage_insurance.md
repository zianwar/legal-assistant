   b. The residential mortgage transaction is at least two years old;

   c. The outstanding principal balance of the residential loan is not greater than eighty percent of the current fair market value of the property and is:

      ii. For all other residential mortgage transactions, less than eighty percent of the appraised value at the time the residential loan transaction was entered into.

The lender or servicer may request that a current appraisal be done to verify the outstanding principal balance is less than eighty percent of the current fair market value of the property; unless otherwise agreed to in writing, the lender or servicer selects the appraiser and splits the cost with the borrower;

   b. Any mortgage funded with bond proceeds issued under an indenture requiring mortgage insurance for the life of the loan.

4. If the residential mortgage transaction will be or has been sold in whole or in part to an institutional third party, adherence to the institutional third party's standards for termination of future payments for mortgage insurance shall be deemed in compliance with this section.
