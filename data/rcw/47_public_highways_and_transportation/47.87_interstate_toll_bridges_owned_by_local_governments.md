## 47.87.010 - Findings.
The legislature finds and declares that:

1. Interstate toll bridges owned by local governments provide critical links for the transport of workers, services, tourism, and emergency response between Washington and Oregon, and for Washington and Oregon businesses to transport local agricultural products, forest products, rock and gravel, and manufactured products within their bistate regions and to broader national markets.

2. Existing local government-owned interstate toll bridges are becoming functionally obsolete, weight-restricted, seismically deficient, and a hazardous obstacle for marine freight; and need to be replaced.

3. Replacement of aging interstate toll bridges by local governments is extremely challenging, and local governments that own or are served by the bridges require additional means to address the problem. For some bistate regions, the successful replacement and subsequent operations of interstate toll bridges can be best accomplished by an independent bistate governmental authority, chartered by local governments, with sufficient powers to efficiently and equitably develop, operate, maintain, toll, and finance the replacement bridge.

## 47.87.030 - Commission formation agreement.
1. Upon enactment of an act by a bordering state having the same material effect as chapter 89, Laws of 2022, as determined by the office of the attorney general, local governments may enter into a commission formation agreement to form and charter a commission under this chapter. The commission shall be a public corporation formed under the laws of both states, vested with the powers and duties granted by this chapter. The commission shall perform an essential governmental function and shall exercise its powers for the public purposes described in this chapter.

2. Local governments may by resolution enter a commission formation agreement, consistent with the requirements of this chapter, to charter and form a commission. The commission formation agreement shall, at a minimum, be approved and executed by the owner of an existing bridge and the governing bodies of the counties within which an existing bridge is situated. A commission formation agreement may be enacted by local governments in phases. However, all required elements of a commission formation agreement must be enacted by the local governments prior to any board authorization to issue toll revenue bonds for the construction of the bridge. The commission formation agreement shall establish the following provisions:

   a. A name for the commission;

   b. The date on which the powers granted to the commission by this chapter become effective;

   c. The primary place of business for the purpose of establishing applicable laws under RCW 47.87.130;

   d. The composition and appointment process for members of the board, as described in RCW 47.87.040 (1) and (2);

   e. The term of office for, and rules, responsibilities, and requirements applicable to, the office of chair and cochair, as described in RCW 47.87.040(4);

   f. The requirements for formal actions of the board, as described in RCW 47.87.040(5); and

3. The commission formation agreement may allow the board to amend all or some of the provisions included in the commission formation agreement pursuant to subsection (2)(d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section and RCW 47.87.040(5), and may establish conditions for such amendments.

4. The purposes of the commission are to:

   a. Design, engineer, develop, finance and refinance, install, equip, and construct a bridge to replace and remove an existing toll bridge;

   b. Act as a cooperative bistate governance structure to develop, own or control, fix and adjust tolls, and regulate the use of a bridge;

## 47.87.040 - Commission, governed by board.
1. The commission shall be governed by a board. The commission formation agreement shall establish the number of voting and, if any, nonvoting or ex officio directors appointed by local governments of each state and, if any, appointed by governmental entities that are not local governments, and shall further establish the procedures for the nomination and appointment of such directors, which may differ by state.

2. Each nominating authority shall nominate and each appointing authority shall appoint an alternate director for each director it nominates or appoints. The alternate director may only act in the absence of the director for whom the alternate is appointed. Unless the context requires otherwise, the term director under this chapter includes the alternate director when such alternate director is acting in the absence of the director.

3. Directors and alternate directors shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred as an incident to the performance of their duties. Directors and alternate directors shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing body, and with or without cause may be removed or suspended from office by the appointing body. The commission formation agreement shall establish the length of the initial term of each of director and alternate director so that subsequent appointments by appointing bodies from each state are reasonably and similarly staggered. Except for the initial appointments of directors and alternate directors, the term of directors and alternate directors shall be four years.

4. The board shall elect two cochairs from among its directors, with one cochair residing in Washington state and the other cochair residing in the bordering state. The two cochairs shall serve as first cochair and second cochair, with the first cochair responsible for presiding at all commission meetings. The board shall indicate which cochair will serve in the respective two positions within the first year after the formation of the commission, after which time the two positions must alternate on an annual basis. The commission formation agreement shall establish the terms of the cochairs, and may establish such other requirements for the office of cochair as the local governments elect.

5. Formal actions of the board shall be by ordinance or resolution duly approved at any regular or special meeting of the board. No action of the board shall be effective unless there is a quorum and a majority of the directors present assent. The commission formation agreement shall establish the requirements for a quorum, and may establish such other requirements for formal actions of the board as the local governments may elect, provided such requirements are consistent with applicable laws.

6. Unless otherwise provided in an ordinance or resolution enacted by the board, the board shall have the exclusive right to exercise the powers granted by this chapter, and the exercise of all powers granted to the board by this chapter shall not be subject to any prior or subsequent authorization, approval, or concurrence by any local government or other governmental entity of either state.

7. The board shall adopt rules, consistent with applicable laws and the commission formation agreement, regarding the organization, activities, and procedures of the board and the commission, as the board may determine.

\[ [2022 c 89 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5558-S.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%2089%20§%204); \]

3. All privileges and immunities from liability, laws, and benefits that apply to directors, officers, agents, or employees of a municipal corporation under applicable law shall apply to the directors, officers, agents, and employees of the commission.

4. The commission may purchase insurance or self-insure to protect and hold personally harmless any of its directors, alternate directors, and the officers, employees, and agents of the commission from any action, claim, or proceeding arising out of their performance, purported performance, or failure of performance, in good faith of duties for, or employment with the commission, and to hold these individuals harmless from any expenses connected with the defense, settlement, or monetary judgments from such actions, claims, or proceedings.

5. The commission may purchase insurance or self-insure against loss or damage to any of its properties or facilities, damage to persons or property, loss of revenues, or such other coverages as the board may elect to accomplish the purposes of the commission. Insurance coverage shall be in such form and amount as the board may determine, provided that it satisfies any requirements of any agreement arising out of issuance of bonds or other obligations by the commission. The board may enter into intergovernmental agreements with any state, or local government, or combination thereof, to acquire or maintain the insurance.

6. The commission shall furnish such information with respect to its affairs as may be requested by the state of Washington, bordering state, or any local government. The commission shall prepare an annual report which summarizes the major activities and expenditures of the commission during the year and anticipated for the following year. The commission shall furnish a copy of the annual report, together with any additional information deemed appropriate, to the local governments and other interested parties.

\[ [2022 c 89 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5558-S.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%2089%20§%206); \]

## 47.87.070 - Financing, refinancing, acquiring, assuming control—Eminent domain.
The commission may:

1. Finance, refinance, and acquire or otherwise assume control by purchase, lease, donation, or by other means such real and personal property, structures, property rights, franchises, easements, and other property interests, whether situated within the state of Washington or the bordering state, as the board may deem necessary or incidental to the purposes of the commission; and

2. Exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire by condemnation any property, structures, property rights, franchises, easements, and other property interests situated within the state of Washington or the bordering state as the board deems necessary or incidental to the purposes of the commission, subject to the applicable laws described in RCW 47.87.130(1)(b). No property owned or held by any state or local government shall be taken by the commission without the prior consent of such state or local government.

\[ [2022 c 89 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5558-S.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%2089%20§%207); \]

## 47.87.080 - Tolls, other charges—Agreements—Photo toll systems—Enforcement—Proceeds.
1. The board shall have the exclusive power to impose, fix, and periodically adjust the rate of tolls and other charges for use of any bridge owned by or operated by the commission without any approval, authorization, or concurrence by a legislature, state toll authority, local government, state agency or official, or other entity. The board may establish and implement such policies and criteria as the board deems advisable for the rate of tolls and other charges including, but not limited to, establishing discounts, exemptions, administrative fees, late fees, civil penalties, and toll rates for such classes of vehicles and users as the board may determine.

2. In setting and periodically adjusting toll rates and other charges, the board shall ensure that toll rates and other charges will annually yield revenue sufficient to meet all costs, expenses, and obligations of the commission, including the satisfaction of all financial and other covenants made by the commission with regard to any bond or other debt instrument.

3. The commission may enter agreements with the Washington state department of licensing and the applicable agency of the bordering state to enforce the payment of tolls and other charges for use of the bridge. Such agreements may provide that if the commission or its designee gives notice to the applicable department that a person has not paid a toll or other charge for use of the bridge, the applicable department shall refuse to renew the motor vehicle registration of the motor vehicle operated by the person at the time of the violation. The applicable department may renew such motor vehicle registration upon receipt of a notice from the commission or its designee indicating that all tolls and other charges owed by the person have been paid.

4. Photo toll systems may take photographs, digital photographs, microphotographs, videotapes, or other recorded images of the vehicle and vehicle license plate only. A photo toll image of a vehicle and the registration plate of the vehicle produced by a photo toll system at the time the driver of the vehicle did not pay a toll is prima facie evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle is the driver of the vehicle. However, if the registered owner of a vehicle is a person in the vehicle rental or leasing business, the registered owner may elect to identify the person who was operating the vehicle at the time the toll was not paid or to pay the toll, civil penalty, and administrative fee. A registered owner of a vehicle who pays the toll, civil penalty, and administrative fee is entitled to recover the same from the driver, renter, or lessee of the vehicle.

5. The rights to enforce the payment of tolls and other charges of the commission granted under this chapter are supplemental; the commission may employ all other remedies available to it under the laws of the state of Washington and the bordering state.

6. The proceeds from toll rates and other charges of the commission shall only be used to pay the necessary and incidental costs and expenses incurred by the commission in connection with owning, constructing, operating, maintaining, renewing, and governing the bridge, which shall include, but not be limited to, costs incurred for:

   a. The design, development, construction, equipping, installation, and financing and refinancing of the bridge, demolition and removal of the existing bridge, and mitigation of associated impacts;

   b. The operations of the bridge including, but not limited to, repair, maintenance, resurfacing, preservation, equipping, improvement, reconstruction, renewal, and replacement;

   c. The tolling of the bridge including, but not limited to, toll collection, administration, and enforcement, and the acquisition, leasing, maintenance, and replacement of tolling equipment and software;

   d. The financing or refinancing of any bonds or other debt instruments of the commission;

   e. A reasonable return on investment for any private financing of any costs, expenses, or obligations of the commission;

   f. The establishment and maintenance of any reserves or sinking funds approved by the board; and

   g. Any other obligations or expenses incurred by the commission in carrying out its purposes under this chapter.

7. The commission may grant to any public or private entity by franchise, lease, or otherwise the use or control of any portion of the bridge or any property or facility owned or under the control of the commission, and may fix the terms, conditions, rents, and other payments for such use.

8. All revenues, receipts, grants, bond proceeds, and other funds of the commission may be comingled and spent to carry out commission purposes within either state, unless and to the extent otherwise restricted by the terms of a grant agreement or debt instrument.

9. For purposes of this section, "photo toll system" means the system defined in RCW 47.56.010 and 47.46.020.

\[ [2022 c 89 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5558-S.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%2089%20§%208); \]

## 47.87.090 - Bridge design and construction.
1. The commission shall design and construct the bridge to standards and specifications satisfactory to the departments of transportation, and in accordance with all applicable permits, clearances, and mitigation requirements. The commission shall arrange for timely review by the departments of transportation of all pertinent engineering plans, specifications, and related reports.

2. The commission may undertake any construction activities that have necessary permits and for which funding is available, provided that prior to issuing a notice to proceed with the construction of any bridge foundation, the commission shall:

   a. Prepare and adopt an initial bridge finance plan to fund the design, construction, operations, maintenance, administration, and governance of the bridge. Prior to adopting the initial bridge finance plan, the board shall require a feasibility review of the initial bridge finance plan and shall submit the feasibility review to the departments of transportation and the local governments for their review as determined by the board. Following the review by the departments of transportation and local governments, the board may adopt the initial bridge finance plan, as it may be amended as a result of the reviews. Following the adoption of the initial bridge finance plan, the board may periodically adjust or amend the bridge finance plan as the board may determine; and

   b. Make and enter into a written agreement with the owner of the applicable existing bridge, under such terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the commission and the owner of the existing bridge, regarding the removal and disposition of the existing bridge. The agreement shall address: (i) The roles, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties with respect to the removal and disposal of the existing bridge, including any liabilities or potential liabilities incidental thereto; (ii) the retirement of any outstanding debt for which toll revenue from the existing bridge is pledged; (iii) the distribution of proceeds from any salvage value of the existing bridge; (iv) the disposition of any property, equipment, or other assets incidental to the existing bridge; (v) mitigation of impacts to existing bridge operations; and (vi) such other matters as the commission and owner of the existing bridge may determine.

3. For purposes of the acquisition, design, construction, installation, operation, or maintenance of the bridge, or any combination thereof, the commission, without any prior or subsequent authorization, approval, or concurrence by any state, local government, or any other governmental entity of either state, may enter into any combination of contracts, agreements, or other arrangements with any one or more private entities or units of government, or any combination thereof, as the commission may elect including, but not limited to, any alternative or supplemental public works contract such as design-build and construction manager-general contractor contracts, public-private partnership agreement, lease agreement, franchise agreement, or financing agreement, and may include such terms and conditions as permitted under the constitutions of both states and the parties may agree to.

4. As part of the construction of a bridge, the commission shall demolish, remove, and dispose of the applicable existing bridge in accordance with all applicable environmental permits and the terms of an agreement between the commission and owner of the existing bridge. Unless otherwise agreed to by the owner of the existing bridge, the proceeds from the sale of any salvaged materials from the existing bridge shall be owing to such owner.

5. A commission is deemed a municipal corporation for the purposes of RCW 82.04.050(10), and therefore the public road construction exemption under RCW 82.04.050(10) shall apply to taxes otherwise owing from construction of a bridge. Subject to RCW 47.87.150, the commission may apply for a deferral of all state and local sales and use taxes incurred from construction of a bridge that are not relieved by the public road construction exemption.

\[ [2022 c 89 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5558-S.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%2089%20§%209); \]

## 47.87.100 - Rules and regulations—Compensation to contractor—Revenue, other assistance.
1. The board shall have the exclusive power to enact and enforce such rules and regulations as the board may elect for the use, operations, maintenance, inspection, and preservation of any bridge owned or operated by the commission, including limiting loads permitted on the bridge and closing the bridge to any traffic deemed unsafe by the commission, provided the commission shall comply with all state and federal regulations generally applicable to bridge operations, maintenance, safety, and inspections.

2. Any facility or property owned, leased, operated, or controlled by the commission may be operated by the commission directly, or by another public or a private entity pursuant to a contract, lease, or agreement that is subject to such terms and conditions as the board may determine.

3. Compensation to a contractor under an operating contract may be in the form of a payment by the commission to the contractor for services rendered, a payment by the contractor to the commission for the rights to operate the facility or property, or such other arrangements as the board may elect.

4. A state agency or local government may pledge or grant revenue or other assistance to support or guaranty, in whole or part, the repayment of debt, costs of operations, or capitalization of reserves of the commission under such terms as the commission and the state agency or local government may agree, and the commission may accept such assistance.

\[ [2022 c 89 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5558-S.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%2089%20§%2010); \]

## 47.87.110 - Revenue bonds or other debt instruments.
1. The commission may, from time to time, without the necessity of any assent by electors, local governments, or any other governmental entity, issue or enter into revenue bonds or other debt instruments paid from or secured by all or any revenues available to the commission in one or more series, and such amounts, maturities, denominations, and forms, with such insurance, credit enhancements, or other guarantees, and with such other terms and provisions as the board may determine.
