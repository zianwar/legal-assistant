## 47.06.010 - Findings.
The legislature recognizes that the ownership and operation of Washington's transportation system is spread among federal, state, and local government agencies, regional transit agencies, port districts, and the private sector. The legislature also recognizes that transportation planning authority is shared on the local, regional, and state levels, and that this planning must be a comprehensive and coordinated effort. While significant authority for transportation planning is vested with local agencies and regional transportation planning organizations under the growth management act, the legislature recognizes that certain transportation issues and facilities cross local and regional boundaries and are vital to the statewide economy and the cross-state mobility of people and goods. Therefore, the state has an appropriate role in developing statewide transportation plans that address state jurisdiction facilities and services as well as transportation facilities and services of state interest. These plans shall serve as a guide for short-term investment needs and provide a long-range vision for transportation system development.

A long-term view of corridors must be employed to determine whether an existing corridor should be expanded, a city or county road should become a state route, and whether a new corridor is needed to alleviate congestion and enhance mobility based on travel demand. To the extent practicable, full costs of all strategies must be reflected in the analysis. At a minimum, this analysis must include:

   a. The current and projected future demand for total person trips on that corridor;

   b. The impact of making no improvements to that corridor;

   c. The daily cost per added person served for each mode or improvement proposed to meet demand;

   d. The cost per hour of travel time saved per day for each mode or improvement proposed to meet demand; and

   e. How much of the current and anticipated future demand will be met and left unmet for each mode or improvement proposed to meet demand.

The end result of this analysis will be to provide a cost-benefit analysis by which policymakers can determine the most cost-effective improvement or mode, or mix of improvements and modes, for increasing mobility and reducing congestion.
