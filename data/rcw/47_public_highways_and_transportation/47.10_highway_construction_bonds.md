## 47.10.791 - Administration and amount of bond sales.
Upon request being made by the transportation commission, the state finance committee shall supervise and provide for the issuance, sale, and retirement of the bonds authorized by RCW 47.10.790 in accordance with the provisions of chapter 39.42 RCW. The amount of such bonds issued and sold under the provisions of RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798 in any biennium may not exceed the amount of a specific appropriation therefor. Such bonds may be sold from time to time in such amounts as may be necessary for the orderly progress of the state highway improvements specified in RCW 47.10.790. The bonds shall be sold in such manner, at such time or times, in such amounts, and at such price or prices as the state finance committee shall determine. The state finance committee may obtain insurance, letters of credit, or other credit facility devices with respect to the bonds and may authorize the execution and delivery of agreements, promissory notes, and other obligations for the purpose of insuring the payment or enhancing the marketability of the bonds. Promissory notes or other obligations issued under this section shall not constitute a debt or the contracting of indebtedness under any constitutional or statutory indebtedness limitation if their payment is conditioned upon the failure of the state to pay the principal of or interest on the bonds with respect to which the promissory notes or other obligations relate. The state finance committee may authorize the issuance of short-term obligations in lieu of long-term obligations for the purposes of more favorable interest rates, lower total interest costs, and increased marketability and for the purposes of retiring the bonds during the life of the project for which they were issued.

The principal of and interest on such bonds must be first payable in the manner provided in RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798 from the proceeds of the state excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels imposed by chapter 82.38 RCW. Proceeds of such excise taxes are hereby pledged to the payment of any bonds and the interest thereon issued under the provisions of RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798, and the legislature hereby agrees to continue to impose the same excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels in amounts sufficient to pay, when due, the principal and interest on all bonds issued under the provisions of RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798.

## 47.10.794 - Designation of funds to repay bonds and interest.
Any funds required to repay the bonds authorized by RCW 47.10.790 or the interest thereon when due shall be taken from that portion of the motor vehicle fund which results from the imposition of excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels and which is distributed to the state for expenditure pursuant to RCW 46.68.130 and shall never constitute a charge against any allocations of such funds to counties, cities, and towns unless and until the amount of the motor vehicle fund arising from the excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels and available for state highway purposes proves insufficient to meet the requirements for bond retirement or interest on any such bonds.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 180 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c180.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%20180%20§%205); \]

## 47.10.795 - Repayment procedure—Bond retirement fund.
At least one year prior to the date any interest is due and payable on such bonds or before the maturity date of such bonds, the state finance committee shall estimate, subject to the provisions of RCW 47.10.794, the percentage of the receipts in money of the motor vehicle fund resulting from collection of excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels, for each month of the year which shall be required to meet interest or bond payments when due and shall notify the treasurer of such estimated requirement. The state treasurer shall thereafter from time to time each month as such funds are paid into the motor vehicle fund, transfer such percentage of the monthly receipts from excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels of the motor vehicle fund to the highway bond retirement fund heretofore created in the state treasury, which funds shall be available solely for payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds when due. If in any month it shall appear that the estimated percentage of moneys so made is insufficient to meet the requirements for payment of the principal thereof or interest thereon, the treasurer shall notify the state finance committee forthwith, and such committee shall adjust its estimates so that all requirements for the interest on and principal of all bonds issued shall be fully met at all times.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 180 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c180.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%20180%20§%206); \]

## 47.10.796 - Sums in excess of retirement requirements—Use.
Whenever the percentage of the motor vehicle fund arising from excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels payable into the highway bond retirement fund shall prove more than is required for the payment of interest on bonds when due, or current retirement of bonds, any excess may, in the discretion of the state finance committee, be available for the prior redemption of any bonds pursuant to applicable bond covenants or remain available in the fund to reduce requirements upon the fuel excise tax portion of the motor vehicle fund.

## 47.10.797 - Bonds legal investment for state funds.
The bonds authorized in RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798 constitute a legal investment for all state funds or for funds under state control and all funds of municipal corporations.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 180 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c180.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%20180%20§%208); \]

## 47.10.798 - Bonds equal charge against fuel tax revenues.
Except as otherwise provided by statute, general obligation bonds issued under authority of legislation enacted during the 45th session of the legislature and thereafter and which pledge motor vehicle and special fuel excise taxes for the payment of principal and interest thereon shall be an equal charge against the revenues from such motor vehicle and special fuel excise taxes.
