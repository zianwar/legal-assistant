\[ [1984 c 7 § 217](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c7.pdf?cite=1984%20c%207%20§%20217); [1971 ex.s. c 101 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c101.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20101%20§%203); \]

## 47.41.040 - Screening or removal of junkyard.
Before July 1, 1971, the department shall determine whether or not the topography of the land adjoining the highway will permit adequate screening of any junkyard lawfully in existence located outside of a zoned industrial area or an unzoned industrial area as defined under RCW 47.41.030 on August 9, 1971, that is within one thousand feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main traveled way of any highway on the interstate and primary system and whether screening of the junkyard would be economically feasible. Within thirty days thereafter the department shall notify by certified mail the record owner of the land upon which the junkyard is located, or the operator thereof, of its determination.

If it is economically feasible to screen the junkyard, the department shall screen the junkyard so that it will not be visible from the main-traveled way of the highway. The department is authorized to acquire by gift, purchase, exchange, or condemnation such lands or interest in lands as may be required for these purposes.

If it is not economically feasible to screen the junkyard, the department shall acquire by purchase, gift, or condemnation an interest in the real property used for junkyard purposes that is visible from the main traveled way of the highway, restricting any owner of the remaining interest to use of the real estate for purposes other than a junkyard. In addition to compensation for the real property interest, the operator of a junkyard shall receive the actual reasonable expenses in moving his or her business personal property to a location within the same general area where a junkyard may be lawfully established, operated, and maintained. This section shall be interpreted as being in addition to all other rights and remedies of a junkyard owner or operator and shall not be interpreted as a limitation on or alteration of the law of compensation in eminent domain.

## 47.41.060 - Other laws not affected.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit a person to maintain any junkyard that is otherwise prohibited by statute or by the resolution or ordinance of any county, city, or town, nor to abrogate or affect the lawful provisions of any statute, ordinance, regulation, or resolution which are more restrictive than the provisions of this chapter.

\[ [1971 ex.s. c 101 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c101.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20101%20§%206); \]

## 47.41.070 - Violations—Penalty—Abatement as public nuisance.
1. If the owner of the land upon which any such junkyard is located, or the operator thereof, as the case may be, fails to comply with the notice or remove any such junk within the time provided in this chapter after being so notified, he or she is guilty of a misdemeanor. In addition to the penalties imposed by law upon conviction, an order may be entered compelling compliance with this chapter. Each day the junkyard is maintained in a manner so as not to comply with this chapter constitutes a separate offense.

2. If the operator of the junkyard or the owner of the property upon which it is located, as the case may be, is not found or refuses receipt of the notice, the department, the chief of the Washington state patrol, the county sheriff, or the chief of police of any city or town shall post the property upon which it is located with a notice that the junkyard constitutes a public nuisance and that the junk thereon must be removed as provided in this chapter. If the notice is not complied with, the department, the chief of the Washington state patrol, the county sheriff, or the chief of police of any city or town shall abate the nuisance and remove the junk, and for that purpose may enter upon private property without incurring liability for doing so.
