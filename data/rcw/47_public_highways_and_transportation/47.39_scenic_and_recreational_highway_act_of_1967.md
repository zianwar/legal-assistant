## 47.39.010 - System created—Standards.
There is hereby created a scenic and recreational highway system. Highways in this system shall be developed and maintained in accordance with general standards for state highways of comparable classification and usage.

Recognizing that the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century establishes a national "scenic byway" program that could benefit state and local roadways, the Washington state scenic byway designation program is revised to address state and local transportation routes. Byways in this program must be designated and maintained in accordance with the criteria developed by the department under this chapter. However, a highway so designated under RCW 47.39.069 does not become part of the scenic and recreational highway system unless approved by the legislature. Corridors within the scenic and recreational highway system that showcase the state's historic agricultural areas and promote the maintenance and enhancement of agricultural areas may be designated as agricultural scenic corridors.

## 47.39.075 - Corridor management plan.

## 47.39.080 - Funding priorities—Signage.
Recognizing that the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century establishes a national "Scenic Byways" grant program and a new apportionment program called "Transportation Enhancement Activities," the department of transportation shall place high priority on obtaining funds from those sources for further development of a scenic and recreational highways program, including enhancement projects on the designated scenic and recreational highway system. The department shall consider the use of the designated system by bicyclists and pedestrians in connection with nonmotorized routes in the state trail plan, and the state bicycle plan which are also eligible for TEA-21 funding. Appropriate signage may be used at intersections of nonmotorized and motorized systems to demonstrate the access, location, and the interconnectivity of various modes of travel for transportation and recreation. For the purposes of leveraging national scenic byway planning grant funds, the commission may designate eligible state highways as scenic byways on an interim basis.

## 47.39.090 - Consultation with other agencies and parties—Identification of tourist routes.
In developing the scenic and recreational highways program, the department shall consult with the *department of community, trade, and economic development, the department of natural resources, the parks and recreation commission, affected cities, towns, and counties, regional transportation planning organizations, statewide bicycling organizations, and other interested parties. The scenic and recreational highways program may identify entire highway loops or similar tourist routes that could be developed to promote tourist activity and provide concurrent economic growth while protecting the scenic and recreational quality surrounding state highways.

## 47.39.100 - Removal of designation.
1. The commission may remove the designation of a route if it no longer possesses the intrinsic qualities or fails to meet the criteria that supported its designation.

2. The department shall determine whether a roadway designated as a national scenic byway or an All-American Roadway is being properly maintained in accordance with the roadway's byway management plan, including preserving the intrinsic qualities that originally supported the designation. When the department determines that the intrinsic qualities of a national scenic byway or All-American Roadway have not been maintained sufficiently to retain its designation, the department shall notify the party responsible for maintaining the designation of the finding and allow the party an opportunity, under federal regulations, for corrective action before formal removal of the designation of the roadway.

3. Local, regional, or other governmental bodies may notify the commission of the removal of a designated route if they determine it no longer meets the designation criteria, or community support for the designation no longer exists, or it no longer possesses the intrinsic qualities that supported its original designation.

4. State or local removal of a designated route will result in discontinued state support of the designated route and can include, but is not limited to, state matching assistance for grant applications, the removal of signs directly related to the byway, free promotional information in the state-owned safety rest areas, and inclusion in maps, brochures, and electronic media.
