1. General: Signs shall not be erected or maintained which (a) imitate or resemble any official traffic sign, signal, or device; (b) are erected or maintained upon trees or painted or drawn upon rocks or other natural features and which are structurally unsafe or in disrepair; or (c) have any visible moving parts.

2. Size of signs:

The maximum area for any one sign shall be six hundred seventy-two square feet with a maximum height of twenty-five feet and maximum length of fifty feet inclusive of any border and trim but excluding the base or apron, supports and other structural members: PROVIDED, That cut-outs and extensions may add up to twenty percent of additional sign area.

   b. For the purposes of this subsection, double-faced, back-to-back, or V-type signs shall be considered as two signs.

   c. Signs which exceed three hundred twenty-five square feet in area may not be double-faced (abutting and facing the same direction).

3. Spacing of signs:

   a. Signs may not be located in such a manner as to obscure, or otherwise physically interfere with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, signal, or device, obstruct or physically interfere with the driver's view of approaching, merging, or intersecting traffic.

   b. On limited access highways established pursuant to chapter 47.52 RCW no two signs shall be spaced less than one thousand feet apart, and no sign may be located within three thousand feet of the center of an interchange, a safety rest area, or information center, or within one thousand feet of an intersection at grade.

A permit may be revoked after hearing if the department finds that any statement made in the application or annual certification process was false or misleading, or that the sign covered is not in good general condition and in a reasonable state of repair, or is otherwise in violation of this chapter, if the false or misleading information has not been corrected and the sign has not been brought into compliance with this chapter or rules adopted under it within thirty days after written notification. Beginning July 1, 2014, the department shall establish and charge by rule an annual fee for type 4 and 5 sign permits. The fee must reasonably recover costs for outdoor advertising control program administration and enforcement and may not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
