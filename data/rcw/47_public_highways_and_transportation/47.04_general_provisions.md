## 47.04.045 - Wireless service facilities—Right-of-way leases—Rules.
1. For the purposes of this section:

   a. "Right-of-way" means all state-owned land within a state highway corridor.

   b. "Service provider" means every corporation, company, association, joint stock association, firm, partnership, or person that owns, operates, or manages any personal wireless service facility. "Service provider" includes a service provider's contractors, subcontractors, and legal successors.

2. The department shall establish a process for issuing a lease for the use of the right-of-way by a service provider and shall require that telecommunications equipment be colocated on the same structure whenever practicable. Consistent with federal highway administration approval, the lease must include the right of direct ingress and egress from the highway for construction and maintenance of the personal wireless service facility during nonpeak hours if public safety is not adversely affected. Direct ingress and egress may be allowed at any time for the construction of the facility if public safety is not adversely affected and if construction will not substantially interfere with traffic flow during peak traffic periods. The lease may specify an indirect ingress and egress to the facility if it is reasonable and available for the particular location.

3. The cost of the lease must be limited to the fair market value of the portion of the right-of-way being used by the service provider and the direct administrative expenses incurred by the department in processing the lease application.

If the department and the service provider are unable to agree on the cost of the lease, the service provider may submit the cost of the lease to binding arbitration by serving written notice on the department. Within thirty days of receiving the notice, each party shall furnish a list of acceptable arbitrators. The parties shall select an arbitrator; failing to agree on an arbitrator, each party shall select one arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator for an arbitration panel. The arbitrator or panel shall determine the cost of the lease based on comparable siting agreements. Costs of the arbitration, including compensation for the arbitrator's services, must be borne equally by the parties participating in the arbitration and each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including legal fees and witness expenses, in connection with the arbitration proceeding.

4. The department shall act on an application for a lease within sixty days of receiving a completed application, unless a service provider consents to a different time period.

5. The reasons for a denial of a lease application must be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.

6. The department may adopt rules to implement this section.

7. All lease money paid to the department under this section shall be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070.

\[ [2003 c 244 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5977-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20244%20§%205); \]

## 47.04.046 - Wireless site leases—Pending applications.
Applications for wireless site leases pending on July 27, 2003, must be treated as applications under RCW 47.04.045 with the consent of the applicant.

\[ [2003 c 244 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5977-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20244%20§%208); \]

## 47.04.047 - Personal wireless service facilities.
Personal wireless service is a critical part of the state's infrastructure. The rapid deployment of personal wireless service facilities is critical to ensure public safety, network access, quality of service, and rural economic development.

It is the declared policy of this state to assure that the use of rights-of-way of state highways accommodate the deployment of personal wireless service facilities consistent with highway safety and the preservation of the public investment in state highway facilities.

## 47.04.050 - Acceptance of federal acts.
The state of Washington hereby assents to the purposes, provisions, terms and conditions of the grant of money provided in an act of congress entitled: "An act to provide that the United States shall aid the states in the construction of rural post roads, and for other purposes," approved July 11, 1916, and all acts, grants and appropriations amendatory and supplementary thereto and affecting the state of Washington.

2. To address these investment gaps, the connecting communities program is established within the department. The purpose of the program is to improve active transportation connectivity in communities by:

   a. Providing safe, continuous routes for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other nonvehicle users carrying out their daily activities;

   b. Mitigating for the health, safety, and access impacts of transportation infrastructure that bisects communities and creates obstacles in the local active transportation network;

   c. Investing in greenways providing protected routes for a wide variety of nonvehicular users; and

   d. Facilitating the planning, development, and implementation of projects and activities that will improve the connectivity and safety of the active transportation network.

3. The department must select projects to propose to the legislature for funding. In selecting projects, the department must consider, at a minimum, the following criteria:

   a. Access to a transit facility, community facility, commercial center, or community-identified assets;

   b. The use of minority and women-owned businesses and community-based organizations in planning, community engagement, design, and construction of the project;

   c. Whether the project will serve:

      i. Overburdened communities as defined in RCW 70A.02.010 to mean a geographic area where vulnerable populations face combined, multiple environmental harms and health impacts, and includes, but is not limited to, highly impacted communities as defined in RCW 19.405.020;

      ii. Vulnerable populations as defined in RCW 70A.02.010 to mean population groups that are more likely to be at higher risk for poor health outcomes in response to environmental harms, due to adverse socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment, high housing, and transportation costs relative to income, limited access to nutritious food and adequate health care, linguistic isolation, and other factors that negatively affect health outcomes and increase vulnerability to the effects of environmental harms; and sensitivity factors, such as low birth weight and higher rates of hospitalization. Vulnerable populations include, but are not limited to: Racial or ethnic minorities, low-income populations, populations disproportionately impacted by environmental harms, and populations of workers experiencing environmental harms;

      iii. Household incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level; and

      iv. People with disabilities;

   d. Environmental health disparities, such as those indicated by the diesel pollution burden portion of the Washington environmental health disparities map developed by the department of health, or other similar indicators;

   e. Location on or adjacent to tribal lands or locations providing essential services to tribal members;

   f. Crash experience involving pedestrians and bicyclists; and

   g. Identified need by the community, for example in the state active transportation plan or a regional, county, or community plan.

4. It is the intent of the legislature that the connecting communities program comply with the requirements of chapter 314, Laws of 2021.

      vi. Repair or replace existing barriers that are damaged or nonfunctional; or

      vii. Take other reasonable actions that are deemed likely to address or prevent vehicle lane departures in specific areas of concern.

   b. The department must create a program whereby it can distribute funding or install safety improvements based on the prioritization process established under (a) of this subsection. Any installation of safety measures that are not under the jurisdiction of the department must be done with permission from the entity that is responsible for operation and maintenance of the roadway.

   c. The department's program must create a form and application process whereby towns, small cities, counties, and transportation benefit districts may apply for program funding for high risk areas in their jurisdictions in need of safety improvements.

   d. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department must issue program funding for purposes defined in (a) and (b) of this subsection in a geographically diverse manner throughout the state. Criteria used to assess a location can include the communities inability or lack of resources to make the corrections themselves and to make corrections where there has been historic disparate impacts.

   e. By December 31st of each year when there is funding distributed in accordance with this program, the department must provide the transportation committees of the legislature and the traffic safety commission with a list of locations that received funding and a description of the safety improvements installed there.

2. During the first five years of the program, the department must track incidence of lane departures at the locations where the new infrastructure is installed and evaluate the effectiveness of the safety improvements.
