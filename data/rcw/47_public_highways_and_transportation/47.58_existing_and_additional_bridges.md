## 47.58.010 - Improvement of existing bridge and construction of new bridge as single project—Agreement—Tolls.
Whenever the legislature specifically authorizes, as a single project, the construction of an additional toll bridge, including approaches, and the reconstruction of an existing adjacent bridge, including approaches, and the imposition of tolls on both bridges, the department is authorized to enter into appropriate agreements whereunder the existing bridge or its approaches will be reconstructed and improved and an additional bridge, including approaches and connecting highways will be constructed as a part of the same project to be located adjacent to or within two miles of the existing bridge and will be financed through the issuance of revenue bonds of the same series. The department has the right to impose tolls for traffic over the existing bridge as well as the additional bridge for the purpose of paying the cost of operation and maintenance of the bridge or bridges and the interest on and creating a sinking fund for retirement of revenue bonds issued for account of such project, all in the manner permitted and provided by this chapter.

For the purpose of obtaining information as to the necessity of the reconstruction or improvement of any such bridge and the expediency of constructing any such additional bridge it is the duty of the department to make any examination, investigation, survey, or reconnaissance pertaining thereto. The cost of any such examination, investigation, survey, or reconnaissance, and all preliminary expenses in the issuance of any revenue bonds, making surveys and appraisals and drafting, printing, issuance, and sale of bonds under this chapter, shall be advanced by any interested municipality, agency, or department of the state of Washington. All such advancements shall be reimbursed out of any proceeds derived from the sale of bonds or out of tolls and revenues to be derived by the department through its operations hereunder for account of the project, as may be agreed upon between the department and the municipality, agency, or department.

The purchase price of all bonds issued hereunder shall be paid to the state treasurer consistent with the provisions of the resolution pursuant to which the bonds have been issued or to the trustee designated in the bond resolution and held as a separate trust fund to be disbursed on the orders of the department.
