## 47.82.010 - Service improvement program.
The department, in conjunction with local jurisdictions, shall coordinate as appropriate with the designated metropolitan planning organizations to develop a program for improving Amtrak passenger rail service. The program may include:

3. Recognition, in the state's long-range planning process, of potential higher speed intercity passenger rail service, while monitoring socioeconomic and technological conditions as indicators for higher speed systems; and

4. Identification of existing intercity rail rights-of-way which may be used for public transportation corridors in the future.
