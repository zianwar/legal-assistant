## 47.56.030 - Powers and duties regarding toll facilities—Purchasing.
1. Except as permitted under chapter 47.29 or 47.46 RCW:

   a. Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department of transportation shall have full charge of the planning, analysis, and construction of all toll bridges and other toll facilities including the Washington state ferries, and the operation and maintenance thereof.

   b. The transportation commission shall determine and establish the tolls and charges thereon.

   c. Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department shall have full charge of planning, analysis, and design of all toll facilities. The department may conduct the planning, analysis, and design of toll facilities as necessary to support the legislature's consideration of toll authorization.

   d. The department shall utilize and administer toll collection systems that are simple, unified, and interoperable. To the extent practicable, the department shall avoid the use of toll booths. The department shall set the statewide standards and protocols for all toll facilities within the state, including those authorized by local authorities.

   e. Except as provided in this section, the department shall proceed with the construction of such toll bridges and other facilities and the approaches thereto by contract in the manner of state highway construction immediately upon there being made available funds for such work and shall prosecute such work to completion as rapidly as practicable. The department is authorized to negotiate contracts for any amount without bid under (e)(i) and (ii) of this subsection:

      i. Emergency contracts, in order to make repairs to ferries or ferry terminal facilities or removal of such facilities whenever continued use of ferries or ferry terminal facilities constitutes a real or immediate danger to the traveling public or precludes prudent use of such ferries or facilities; and

      ii. Single source contracts for vessel dry dockings, when there is clearly and legitimately only one available bidder to conduct dry dock-related work for a specific class or classes of vessels. The contracts may be entered into for a single vessel dry docking or for multiple vessel dry dockings for a period not to exceed two years.

   f. Any new vessel planning, construction, purchase, analysis, or design work must be consistent with RCW 47.60.810.

2. The department shall proceed with the procurement of materials, supplies, services, and equipment needed for the support, maintenance, and use of a ferry, ferry terminal, or other facility operated by Washington state ferries, in accordance with chapter 43.19 RCW except as follows:

   a. When the secretary of the department of transportation determines in writing that the use of invitation for bid is either not practicable or not advantageous to the state and it may be necessary to make competitive evaluations, including technical or performance evaluations among acceptable proposals to complete the contract award, a contract may be entered into by use of a competitive sealed proposals method, and a formal request for proposals solicitation. Such formal request for proposals solicitation shall include a functional description of the needs and requirements of the state and the significant factors.

   b. When purchases are made through a formal request for proposals solicitation the contract shall be awarded to the responsible proposer whose competitive sealed proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the state taking into consideration price and other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No significant factors may be used in evaluating a proposal that are not specified in the request for proposals. Factors that may be considered in evaluating proposals include but are not limited to: Price; maintainability; reliability; commonality; performance levels; life-cycle cost if applicable under this section; cost of transportation or delivery; delivery schedule offered; installation cost; cost of spare parts; availability of parts and service offered; and the following:

      i. The ability, capacity, and skill of the proposer to perform the contract or provide the service required;

      ii. The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the proposer;

      iii. Whether the proposer can perform the contract within the time specified;

      iv. The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;

      v. The previous and existing compliance by the proposer with laws relating to the contract or services;

      vi. Objective, measurable criteria defined in the request for proposal. These criteria may include but are not limited to items such as discounts, delivery costs, maintenance services costs, installation costs, and transportation costs; and

      vii. Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.

   c. When purchases are made through a request for proposal process, proposals received shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. When issuing a request for proposal for the procurement of propulsion equipment or systems that include an engine, the request for proposal must specify the use of a life-cycle cost analysis that includes an evaluation of fuel efficiency. When a life-cycle cost analysis is used, the life-cycle cost of a proposal shall be given at least the same relative importance as the initial price element specified in the request of proposal documents. The department may reject any and all proposals received. If the proposals are not rejected, the award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal is most advantageous to the department, considering price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.

Any surplus which may exist in the construction fund shall be applied to the retirement of bonds issued for the construction of such toll bridge or toll bridges by purchase or call. If these bonds cannot be purchased at a price satisfactory to the department and are not by their terms callable prior to maturity, the surplus shall be paid into the fund applicable to the payment of principal and interest of the bonds and shall be used for that purpose. The proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds may provide limitations and conditions upon the time and manner of applying the surplus to the purchase and call of outstanding bonds and the terms upon which they shall be purchased or called. Such limitations and conditions shall be followed and observed in the application and use of the surplus. All bonds so retired by purchase or call shall be immediately canceled.

The last maturity date of the refunding bonds may not be later than January 1, 2002.

2. The refunding bonds must be signed by the governor and the state treasurer under the seal of the state, which signatures must be made manually or in printed facsimile. The bonds must be registered in the name of the owner in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW. The refunding bonds must distinctly state that they are a general obligation of the state of Washington, must pledge the full faith and credit of the state, and must contain an unconditional promise to pay the principal thereof and the interest thereon when due. The refunding bonds must be fully negotiable instruments.

3. The principal and interest on the refunding bonds must be first payable in the manner provided in this section from the proceeds of state excise taxes on fuels imposed by chapter 82.38 RCW.

4. The principal of and interest on the refunding bonds must be paid first from the state excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels deposited in the ferry bond retirement fund. There is hereby pledged the proceeds of state excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels imposed under chapter 82.38 RCW to pay the refunding bonds and interest thereon, and the legislature hereby agrees to continue to impose the same excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels in amounts sufficient to pay, when due, the principal and interest on the refunding bonds. Not less than fifteen days prior to the date any interest or principal and interest payments are due, the state finance committee must certify to the state treasurer such amount of additional money as may be required for debt service, and the treasurer must thereupon transfer from the motor vehicle fund such amount from the proceeds of such excise taxes into the ferry bond retirement fund. Any proceeds of such excise taxes required for these purposes must first be taken from that portion of the motor vehicle fund which results from the imposition of the excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels and which is distributed to the Puget Sound capital construction account. If the proceeds from excise taxes distributed to the state are ever insufficient to meet the required payments on principal or interest on the refunding bonds when due, the amount required to make the payments on the principal or interest must next be taken from that portion of the motor vehicle fund which results from the imposition of excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels and which is distributed to the state, counties, cities, and towns pursuant to RCW 46.68.090. Any payments of the principal or interest taken from the motor vehicle or special fuel tax revenues which are distributable to the counties, cities, and towns must be repaid from the first money distributed to the state not required for redemption of the refunding bonds or interest thereon. The legislature covenants that it will at all times provide sufficient revenues from the imposition of such excise taxes to pay the principal and interest due on the refunding bonds.

The legislature further authorizes the transportation commission, as the tolling authority for the state, to set and adjust toll rates on the state route number 520 corridor in accordance with the authorization, requirements, and guidelines set forth in RCW 47.56.830, 47.56.850, and 47.56.870. The transportation commission may adjust the toll rates, as identified in the adopted schedule of toll rates, only in amounts not greater than those sufficient to meet (a) the operating costs of the state route number 520 corridor, including necessary maintenance, preservation, renewal, replacement, administration, and toll enforcement by public law enforcement and (b) obligations for the timely payment of debt service on bonds issued under chapter 498, Laws of 2009 and chapter 377, Laws of 2011, and any other associated financing costs including, but not limited to, required reserves, minimum debt coverage or other appropriate contingency funding, insurance, and compliance with all other financial and other covenants made by the state in the bond proceedings. Prior to the convening of each regular session of the legislature, the transportation commission must provide the transportation committees of the legislature with a detailed report regarding any increase or decrease in any toll rate approved by the commission that has not been described in a previous report provided pursuant to this subsection (1), along with a detailed justification for each such increase or decrease.

## 47.56.805 - Finding—Intent.
The legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to use tolling to provide a source of transportation funding and to encourage effective use of the transportation system.

The legislature intends that the policy framework created by chapter 122, Laws of 2008 will guide subsequent legislation and decisions regarding the tolling of specific facilities and corridors. For each state-owned facility or corridor, the legislature intends that it will authorize the budget and finance plan. Specific issues that may be addressed in the finance plan and budget authorization legislation include the amount of financing required for a facility or corridor, the budget for any construction and operations financed by tolling, whether and how variable pricing will be applied, and the timing of tolling.

The legislature also intends that while the transportation commission, as the toll-setting authority, may set toll rates for facilities, corridors, or systems thereof, the legislature reserves the authority to impose tolls on any state transportation route or facility. Similarly, local or quasi-local entities that retain the power to impose tolls may do so as long as the effect of those tolls on the state highway system is consistent with the policy guidelines detailed in chapter 122, Laws of 2008. If the imposition of tolls could have an impact on state facilities, the state tolling authority must review and approve such tolls.

\[ [2008 c 122 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1773-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20122%20§%201); \]

## 47.56.810 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this subchapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

1. "Eligible toll facility" or "eligible toll facilities" means portions of the state highway system specifically identified by the legislature including, but not limited to, transportation corridors, bridges, crossings, interchanges, on-ramps, off-ramps, approaches, bistate facilities, and interconnections between highways.

2. "Express toll lanes" means one or more high occupancy vehicle lanes of a highway in which the department charges tolls primarily as a means of regulating access to or use of the lanes to maintain travel speed and reliability.

3. "Toll revenue" or "revenue from an eligible toll facility" means toll receipts, all interest income derived from the investment of toll receipts, and any gifts, grants, or other funds received for the benefit of transportation facilities in the state, including eligible toll facilities.

4. "Tolling authority" means the governing body that is legally empowered to review and adjust toll rates. Unless otherwise delegated, the transportation commission is the tolling authority for all state highways.

\[ [2011 c 377 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5700-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20377%20§%207); [2011 c 369 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1382.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20369%20§%202); [2008 c 122 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1773-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20122%20§%203); \]

## 47.56.820 - Imposition of tolls on eligible toll facilities—Who may authorize, revenue expenditures.
1. Unless otherwise delegated, only the legislature may authorize the imposition of tolls on eligible toll facilities.

2. All revenue from an eligible toll facility must be used only to construct, improve, preserve, maintain, manage, or operate the eligible toll facility on or in which the revenue is collected. Expenditures of toll revenues are subject to appropriation and must be made only:

   a. To cover the operating costs of the eligible toll facility, including necessary maintenance, preservation, administration, and toll enforcement by public law enforcement within the boundaries of the facility;

   b. To meet obligations for the repayment of debt and interest on the eligible toll facilities, and any other associated financing costs including, but not limited to, required reserves and insurance;

   c. To meet any other obligations to provide funding contributions for any projects or operations on the eligible toll facilities;

   d. To provide for the operations of conveyances of people or goods; or

   e. For any other improvements to the eligible toll facilities.

\[ [2008 c 122 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1773-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20122%20§%204); \]

## 47.56.830 - Policy guidelines for eligible toll facility proposals.
Any proposal for the establishment of eligible toll facilities shall consider the following policy guidelines:

1. Overall direction. Washington should use tolling to encourage effective use of the transportation system and provide a source of transportation funding.

2. When to use tolling. Tolling should be used when it can be demonstrated to contribute a significant portion of the cost of a project that cannot be funded solely with existing sources or optimize the performance of the transportation system. Such tolling should, in all cases, be fairly and equitably applied in the context of the statewide transportation system and not have significant adverse impacts through the diversion of traffic to other routes that cannot otherwise be reasonably mitigated. Such tolling should also consider relevant social equity, environmental, and economic issues, and should be directed at making progress toward the state's greenhouse gas reduction goals.

3. Use of toll revenue. All revenue from an eligible toll facility must be used only to improve, preserve, manage, or operate the eligible toll facility on or in which the revenue is collected. Additionally, toll revenue should provide for and encourage the inclusion of recycled and reclaimed construction materials.

4. Setting toll rates. Toll rates, which may include variable pricing, must be set to meet anticipated funding obligations. To the extent possible, the toll rates should be set to optimize system performance, recognizing necessary trade-offs to generate revenue.

5. Duration of toll collection. Because transportation infrastructure projects have costs and benefits that extend well beyond those paid for by initial construction funding, tolls on future toll facilities may remain in place to fund additional capacity, capital rehabilitation, maintenance, management, and operations, and to optimize performance of the system.

\[ [2008 c 122 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1773-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20122%20§%205); \]

## 47.56.840 - Tolling advisory committee.
1. A tolling advisory committee may be created at the direction of the tolling authority for any eligible toll facilities. The tolling authority shall appoint nine members to the committee, all of whom must be permanent residents of the affected project area as defined for each project. Members of the committee shall serve without receiving compensation.

2. The tolling advisory committee shall serve in an advisory capacity to the tolling authority on all matters related to the imposition of tolls including, but not limited to: (a) The feasibility of providing discounts; (b) the trade-off of lower tolls versus the early retirement of debt; and (c) consideration of variable or time of day pricing.

3. In setting toll rates, the tolling authority shall consider recommendations of the tolling advisory committee.

\[ [2008 c 122 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1773-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20122%20§%206); \]

## 47.56.850 - Transportation commission as state tolling authority—Powers and duties—Toll rates—Restrictions on toll revenue.
1. Unless these powers are otherwise delegated by the legislature, the transportation commission is the tolling authority for the state. The tolling authority shall:

   a. Set toll rates, establish appropriate exemptions, if any, and make adjustments as conditions warrant on eligible toll facilities;

   b. Review toll collection policies, toll operations policies, and toll revenue expenditures on the eligible toll facilities and report annually on this review to the legislature.

2. The tolling authority, in determining toll rates, shall consider the policy guidelines established in RCW 47.56.830.

3. Unless otherwise directed by the legislature, in setting and periodically adjusting toll rates, the tolling authority must ensure that toll rates will generate revenue sufficient to:

   a. Meet the operating costs of the eligible toll facilities, including necessary maintenance, preservation, renewal, replacement, administration, and toll enforcement by public law enforcement;

   b. Meet obligations for the timely payment of debt service on bonds issued for eligible toll facilities, and any other associated financing costs including, but not limited to, required reserves, minimum debt coverage or other appropriate contingency funding, insurance, and compliance with all other financial and other covenants made by the state in the bond proceedings; 

   c. Meet obligations to reimburse the motor vehicle fund for excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels applied to the payment of bonds issued for eligible toll facilities; and

   d. Meet any other obligations of the tolling authority to provide its proportionate share of funding contributions for any projects or operations of the eligible toll facilities.

4. The established toll rates may include variable pricing, and should be set to optimize system performance, recognizing necessary trade-offs to generate revenue for the purposes specified in subsection (3) of this section. Tolls may vary for type of vehicle, time of day, traffic conditions, or other factors designed to improve performance of the system.

5. In fixing and adjusting toll rates under this section, the only toll revenue to be taken into account must be toll revenue pledged to bonds that includes toll receipts, and the only debt service requirements to be taken into account must be debt service on bonds payable from and secured by toll revenue that includes toll receipts.

6. The legislature pledges to appropriate toll revenue as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. When the legislature has specifically identified and designated an eligible toll facility and authorized the issuance of bonds for the financing of the eligible toll facility that are payable from and secured by a pledge of toll revenue, the legislature further agrees for the benefit of the owners of outstanding bonds issued by the state for eligible toll facilities to continue in effect and not to impair or withdraw the authorization of the tolling authority to fix and adjust tolls as provided in this section. The state finance committee shall pledge the state's obligation to impose and maintain tolls, together with the application of toll revenue as described in this section, to the owners of any bonds.

1. The initial imposition of tolls on the portion of state route number 99 that is the deep bore tunnel under First Avenue from the vicinity of the sports stadiums in Seattle to Aurora Avenue north of the Battery Street tunnel is authorized, this portion of state route number 99 is designated an eligible toll facility, and toll revenue generated from this facility must only be expended as allowed under RCW 47.56.820.

2. The toll imposed under this section must be charged only for travel on the portion of state route number 99 that is a deep bore tunnel.

3. [Empty]

   a. In setting toll rates for the deep bore tunnel portion of state route number 99 pursuant to RCW 47.56.850, the tolling authority shall set a variable schedule of toll rates to maintain travel time, speed, and reliability on this facility and generate the necessary revenue as required under (b) of this subsection.

   b. The tolling authority may adjust the variable schedule of toll rates at least annually to reflect inflation as measured by the consumer price index to meet the redemption of bonds, to meet the obligations of the tolling authority under RCW 47.56.850, and interest payments on bonds and for those costs that are eligible under RCW 47.56.820.

## 47.56.870 - State route No. 520 corridor—Tolls authorized—Eligible toll facility—Toll revenue—Toll rate schedule—Bridge replacement program, work groups.
1. The initial imposition of tolls on the state route number 520 corridor is authorized, the state route number 520 corridor is designated an eligible toll facility, and toll revenue generated in the corridor must only be expended as allowed under RCW 47.56.820.

2. The state route number 520 corridor consists of that portion of state route number 520 between the junctions of Interstate 5 and state route number 202. The toll imposed by this section shall be charged only for travel on the floating bridge portion of the state route number 520 corridor.

3. [Empty]

   a. In setting the toll rates for the corridor pursuant to RCW 47.56.850, the tolling authority shall set a variable schedule of toll rates to maintain travel time, speed, and reliability on the corridor and generate the necessary revenue as required under (b) of this subsection.

   b. The tolling authority shall initially set the variable schedule of toll rates, which the tolling authority may adjust at least annually to reflect inflation as measured by the consumer price index or as necessary to meet the redemption of bonds and interest payments on the bonds, to generate revenue sufficient to provide for:

      i. The issuance of general obligation bonds, authorized in RCW 47.10.879, first payable from toll revenue and then excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels pledged for the payment of those bonds in the amount necessary to fund the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program, subject to subsection (4) of this section; and

      ii. Costs associated with the project designated in subsection (4) of this section that are eligible under RCW 47.56.820.

4. [Empty]

   a. The proceeds of the bonds designated in subsection (3)(b)(i) of this section must be used only to fund the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program; however, two hundred million dollars of bond proceeds, in excess of the proceeds necessary to complete the floating bridge segment and necessary landings, must be used only to fund the state route number 520, Interstate 5 to Medina bridge replacement and HOV project segment of the program, as identified in applicable environmental impact statements, and may be used to fund effective connections for high occupancy vehicles and transit for state route number 520, but only to the extent those connections benefit or improve the operation of state route number 520.

   b. The program must include the following elements within the cost constraints identified in section 1, chapter 472, Laws of 2009, consistent with the legislature's intent that cost savings applicable to the program stay within the program and that the bridge open to vehicular traffic in 2014:

      i. A project design, consistent with *RCW 47.01.408, that includes high occupancy vehicle lanes with a minimum carpool occupancy requirement of three-plus persons on state route number 520;

      ii. High occupancy vehicle lane performance standards for the state route number 520 corridor established by the department. The department shall report to the transportation committees of the legislature when average transit speeds in the two lanes that are for high occupancy vehicle travel fall below forty-five miles per hour at least ten percent of the time during peak hours;

      iii. A work group convened by the mayor and city council of the city of Seattle to include sound transit, King county metro, the Seattle department of transportation, the department, the University of Washington, and other persons or organizations as designated by the mayor or city council to study and make recommendations of alternative connections for transit, including bus routes and high capacity transit, to the university link light rail line. The work group must consider such techniques as grade separation, additional stations, and pedestrian lids to effect these connections. The recommendations must be alternatives to the transit connections identified in the supplemental draft environmental impact statement for the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program released in January 2010, and must meet the requirements under *RCW 47.01.408, including accommodating effective connections for transit. The recommendations must be within the scope of the supplemental draft environmental impact statement. For the purposes of this section, "effective connections for transit" means a connection that connects transit stops, including high capacity transit stops, that serve the state route number 520/Montlake interchange vicinity to the university link light rail line, with a connection distance of less than one thousand two hundred feet between the stops and the light rail station. The city of Seattle shall submit the recommendations by October 1, 2010, to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature. However, if the city of Seattle does not convene the work group required under this subsection before July 1, 2010, or does not submit recommendations to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature by October 1, 2010, the department must convene the work group required under this subsection and meet all the requirements of this subsection that are described as requirements of the city of Seattle by November 30, 2010;

      iv. A work group convened by the department to include sound transit and King county metro to study and make recommendations regarding options for planning and financing high capacity transit through the state route number 520 corridor. The department shall submit the recommendations by January 1, 2011, to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature;

      v. A plan to address mitigation as a result of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program at the Washington park arboretum. As part of its process, the department shall consult with the governing board of the Washington park arboretum, the Seattle city council and mayor, and the University of Washington to identify all mitigation required by state and federal law resulting from the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program's impact on the arboretum, and to develop a project mitigation plan to address these impacts. The department shall submit the mitigation plan by December 31, 2010, to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature. Wetland mitigation required by state and federal law as a result of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program's impacts on the arboretum must, to the greatest extent practicable, include on-site wetland mitigation at the Washington park arboretum, and must enhance the Washington park arboretum. This subsection (4)(b)(v) does not preclude any other mitigation planned for the Washington park arboretum as a result of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program;

      vi. A work group convened by the department to include the mayor of the city of Seattle, the Seattle city council, the Seattle department of transportation, and other persons or organizations as designated by the Seattle city council and mayor to study and make recommendations regarding design refinements to the preferred alternative selected by the department in the supplemental draft environmental impact statement process for the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program. To accommodate a timely progression of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program, the design refinements recommended by the work group must be consistent with the current environmental documents prepared by the department for the supplemental draft environmental impact statement. The department shall submit the recommendations to the legislature and governor by December 31, 2010, and the recommendations must inform the final environmental impact statement prepared by the department; and

      vii. An account, created in section 5 of this act, into which civil penalties generated from the nonpayment of tolls on the state route number 520 corridor are deposited to be used to fund any project within the program, including mitigation. However, this subsection (4)(b)(vii) is contingent on the enactment by June 30, 2010, of either chapter 249, Laws of 2010 or **chapter . . . (Substitute House Bill No. 2897), Laws of 2010, but if the enacted bill does not designate the department as the toll penalty adjudicating agency, this subsection (4)(b)(vii) is null and void.

5. The department may carry out the improvements designated in subsection (4) of this section and administer the tolling program on the state route number 520 corridor.

## 47.56.888 - Interstate 405 and state route number 167 corridors—Performance—Reevaluation of options.
The legislature recognizes the need to reduce congestion and improve mobility on the Interstate 405 and state route number 167 corridors, and finds that performance on the corridors has not met the goal that average vehicle speeds in the express toll lanes remain above 45 miles per hour at least 90 percent of the time during peak hours. Therefore, the legislature intends that the commission reevaluate options at least every two years to improve performance on the Interstate 405 and state route number 167 corridors, pursuant to RCW 47.56.880 and 47.56.850.

## 47.56.895 - Puget Sound Gateway facility—Toll rates.
1. The Puget Sound Gateway facility is designated an eligible toll facility, tolls are authorized to be imposed on the Puget Sound Gateway facility, and toll revenue generated must be expended only as allowed under RCW 47.56.820.

2. [Empty]

   a. In setting toll rates for the Puget Sound Gateway facility, pursuant to RCW 47.56.850, the tolling authority shall set a variable schedule of toll rates to maintain travel time, speed, and reliability on the Puget Sound Gateway facility.

   b. The tolling authority may adjust toll rates to reflect inflation as measured by the consumer price index or as necessary for those costs that are eligible under RCW 47.56.820 and to meet the obligations of the tolling authority under RCW 47.56.850.

   c. After the bonds issued pursuant to RCW 47.10.896(1)(b) are retired, the tolling authority must reduce the toll rates commensurate with this reduction in the amount of toll revenues required from the express toll lanes.

3. For the purposes of this section and RCW 47.56.897, "Puget Sound Gateway facility" means the state route number 167 roadway between north Meridian Avenue in Puyallup and Interstate 5 in Fife, the state route number 509 spur between Interstate 5 in Fife and state route number 509 in Tacoma, and the state route number 509 roadway between south 188th Street and Interstate 5 in SeaTac.

4. Prior to setting the schedule of toll rates on the portion of state route number 509 between South 188th Street and Interstate 5 in SeaTac, the department, in collaboration with the transportation commission, must analyze and present to the transportation commission at least one schedule of toll rates that exempts, discounts, or provides other toll relief for low-income drivers during all hours of operation on state route number 509 between South 188th Street and Interstate 5 in SeaTac. In analyzing the schedule of toll rates, the department shall consider implementing an exemption, discount, or other toll relief policy for drivers that reside in close proximity to the corridor.

## 47.56.897 - Puget Sound Gateway facility account.
1. A special account to be known as the Puget Sound Gateway facility account is created in the motor vehicle fund.

2. Deposits to the account must include:

   a. All proceeds of bonds authorized in RCW 47.10.896(1)(b) and loans for the Puget Sound Gateway project, including capitalized interest;

   b. All tolls and other revenues received from the operation of the Puget Sound Gateway facility, to be deposited at least monthly;

   c. Any interest that may be earned from the deposit or investment of those revenues;

   d. Notwithstanding RCW 47.12.063, proceeds from the sale of any surplus real property acquired for completing the Puget Sound Gateway project, including existing state route number 509 right-of-way in SeaTac and Des Moines; and

   e. All damages liquidated or otherwise, collected under any contract involving the Puget Sound Gateway project.

3. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation, consistent with RCW 47.56.820.

4. The proceeds of the general obligation bonds authorized in RCW 47.10.896(1)(b) shall be used to make progress toward completion of the Puget Sound Gateway facility. It is the intent of the legislature to use the bond proceeds to advance the Puget Sound Gateway facility in order to maximize net mobility benefits for both freight and the traveling public. It is the intent of the legislature for tolling to begin on stage one of the project as soon as practicable in order to leverage toll funds, use bond proceeds to advance one hundred twenty-nine million dollars of connecting Washington state appropriations by two biennia to the 2023-2025 biennium, and advance local and federal contributions. This will allow the department of transportation to deliver and open to the public stage two of the project in fiscal year 2028, three years earlier than originally planned, and to realize twenty million dollars in cost savings in connecting Washington state appropriations.

5. It is also the intent of the legislature to use the bond proceeds for up to five million dollars to provide noise mitigation on state route number 509 between south 188th Street and Interstate 5.

6. It is further the intent of the legislature to clarify how the tolling of state route number 167 and state route number 509 will be implemented by requiring the transportation commission and the department of transportation to consider naming the sections of each facility where all of the lanes are tolled as the state route number 167 express way and the state route number 509 express way respectively.
