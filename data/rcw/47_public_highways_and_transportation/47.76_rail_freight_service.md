## 47.76.200 - Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that a balanced multimodal transportation system is required to maintain the state's commitment to the growing mobility needs of its citizens and commerce. The state's freight rail system, including branch lines, mainlines, rail corridors, terminals, yards, and equipment, is an important element of this multimodal system. Washington's economy relies heavily upon the freight rail system to ensure movement of the state's agricultural, chemical, and natural resources and manufactured products to local, national, and international markets and thereby contributes to the economic vitality of the state.

Since 1970, Washington has lost over one-third of its rail miles to abandonment and bankruptcies. The combination of rail abandonments and rail system capacity constraints may alter the delivery to market of many commodities. In addition, the resultant motor vehicle freight traffic increases the burden on state highways and county roads. In many cases, the cost of maintaining and upgrading the state highways and county roads exceeds the cost of maintaining rail freight service. Thus, the economy of the state will be best served by a policy of maintaining and encouraging a healthy rail freight system by creating mechanisms that keep rail freight lines operating if the benefits of the service outweigh the cost.

Recognizing the implications of this trend for freight mobility and the state's economic future, the legislature finds that better freight rail planning, better cooperation to preserve rail lines, and increased financial assistance from the state are necessary to maintain and improve the freight rail system within the state.

## 47.76.210 - State freight rail program.
The Washington state department of transportation shall implement a state freight rail program that supports the freight rail service objectives identified in the state's multimodal transportation plan required under chapter 47.06 RCW. The support may be in the form of projects and strategies that support branch lines and light-density lines, provide access to ports, maintain adequate mainline capacity, and preserve or restore rail corridors and infrastructure.

\[ [1995 c 380 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5655.SL.pdf?cite=1995%20c%20380%20§%202); [1990 c 43 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c43.pdf?cite=1990%20c%2043%20§%202); \]

## 47.76.220 - State rail plan—Contents.

## 47.76.240 - Rail preservation program.
The state, counties, local communities, ports, railroads, labor, and shippers all benefit from continuation of rail service and should participate in its preservation. Lines that provide benefits to the state and local jurisdictions, such as avoided roadway costs, reduced traffic congestion, economic development potential, environmental protection, and safety, should be assisted through the joint efforts of the state, local jurisdictions, and the private sector.

State funding for rail service, rail preservation, and corridor preservation projects must benefit the state's interests. The state's interest is served by reducing public roadway maintenance and repair costs, increasing economic development opportunities, increasing domestic and international trade, preserving jobs, and enhancing safety. State funding for projects is contingent upon appropriate local jurisdiction and private sector participation and cooperation. Before spending state moneys on projects, the department shall seek federal, local, and private funding and participation to the greatest extent possible.

1. The department of transportation shall continue to monitor the status of the state's mainline and branchline common carrier railroads and preserved rail corridors through the state rail plan and various analyses, and shall seek alternatives to abandonment prior to interstate commerce commission proceedings, where feasible.

2. The utilities and transportation commission shall intervene in proceedings of the surface transportation board, or its successor agency, on abandonments, when necessary, to protect the state's interest.

3. The department of transportation, in consultation with the Washington state freight rail policy advisory committee, shall establish criteria for evaluating rail projects and corridors of significance to the state.

4. Local jurisdictions may implement rail service preservation projects in the absence of state participation.

5. The department of transportation shall continue to monitor projects for which it provides assistance.

## 47.76.400 - Produce railcar pool—Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that an actively coordinated and cooperatively facilitated railcar pool for transportation of perishable agricultural commodities is necessary for the continued viability and competitiveness of Washington's agricultural industry. The legislature also finds that the rail transportation model established by the Washington Grain Train program has been successful in serving the shipping needs of the wheat industry.

It is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to authorize and direct the Washington department of transportation to develop a railcar program for Washington's perishable commodity industries to be known as the Washington Produce Railcar Pool. This railcar program should be modeled from the Washington Grain Train program, but be made flexible enough to work with entities outside state government in order to fulfill its mission, including, but not limited to, the federal and local governments, commodity commissions, and private entities.

\[ [2003 c 191 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5912-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20191%20§%201); \]

## 47.76.420 - Produce railcar pool—Departmental authority.
In addition to powers otherwise granted by law, the department may establish a Washington Produce Railcar Pool to promote viable, cost-effective rail service for Washington produce, including but not limited to apples, onions, pears, and potatoes, both processed and fresh.

To the extent that funds are appropriated, the department may:

1. Operate the Washington Produce Railcar Pool program while working in close coordination with the department of agriculture, interested commodity commissions, port districts, and other interested parties;

2. For the purposes of this program:

   a. Purchase or lease new or used refrigerated railcars;

   b. Accept donated refrigerated railcars; and

   c. Refurbish and remodel the railcars;

3. Hire, in consultation with affected stakeholders, including but not limited to short line railroads, commodity commissions, and port districts, a transportation management firm to perform the function outlined in RCW 47.76.440; and

4. Contribute the efforts of a short line rail-financing expert to find funding for the project to help interested short line railroads in this state to accomplish the necessary operating arrangements once the railcars are ready for service.

## 47.76.440 - Produce railcar pool—Management.
1. The transportation management firm hired under RCW 47.76.420(3) shall manage the day-to-day operations of the railcars, such as monitoring the location of the cars, returning them to this state, distributing them, arranging for pretrips and repairs, and arranging for per diem, mileage allowances, and other freight billing charges with the railroads.

2. The railcar pool must be managed over the life of the railcars so that the railcars will be distributed to railroads and port districts around the state for produce loadings as market conditions warrant or to other users, including out-of-state users by contractual agreement, during times of excess capacity.

3. To maximize railcar availability and use, the department or the transportation management firm may make agreements with the transcontinental railroad systems to pool Washington-owned or Washington-managed railcars with those of the railroads. In such instances, the railroad must agree to provide immediately an equal number of railcars to the Washington railcar pool.

4. The department shall act in an oversight role to verify that the railcar pool is managed in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

Expenditures from the account may be used only for the purposes of RCW 47.76.400 through 47.76.440. Only the secretary of transportation or the secretary's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.
