## 47.28.010 - Latitude in selecting route.
Whenever the general route of any state highway shall be designated and laid out as running to or by way of certain designated points, without specifying the particular route to be followed to or by way of such points, the department shall determine the particular route to be followed by said state highway to or by way of said designated points, and shall be at liberty to select and adopt as a part of such state highway, the whole or any part of any existing public highway previously designated as a county road, primary road, or secondary road or now or hereafter classified as a county road. The department need not select and adopt the entire routes for such state highways at one time, but may select and adopt parts of such routes from time to time as it deems advisable. Where a state highway is designated as passing by way of a certain point, this shall not require the department to cause such state highway to pass through or touch such point but such designation is directional only and may be complied with by location in the general vicinity. The department is empowered to construct as a part of any state highway as designated and in addition to any portion meeting the limits of any incorporated city or town a bypass section either through or around any such incorporated city or town.

## 47.28.020 - Width of right-of-way.
From and after April 1, 1937, the width of one hundred feet is the necessary and proper right-of-way width for state highways unless the department, for good cause, adopts and designates a different width. This section shall not be construed to require the department to acquire increased right-of-way for any state highway in existence on such date.

## 47.28.025 - Description and plan of new or limited access highway—Recording.
Whenever the department establishes the location, width, and lines of any new highway, or declares any such new highway as a limited access facility and schedules the acquisition of the right-of-way for the highway or facility within the ensuing two years, it may cause the description and plan of any such highway to be made, showing the center line of the highway and the established width thereof, and attach thereto a certified copy of the resolution. Such description, plan, and resolution shall then be recorded in the office of the county auditor of the proper county.

## 47.28.026 - Description and plan of new or limited access highway—Buildings and improvements prohibited, when.
1. No owner or occupier of lands, buildings, or improvements may erect any buildings or make any improvements within the limits of any such highway, the location, width, and lines of which have been established and recorded as provided in RCW 47.28.025. If any such erection and improvements are made, no allowances may be had therefor by the assessment of damages. No permits for improvements within the limits may be issued by any authority. The establishment of any highway location as set forth in RCW 47.28.025 is ineffective after one year from the filing thereof if no action to condemn or acquire the property within the limits has been commenced within that time.

2. Unless and until the department causes a plan of a proposed new highway or limited access facility to be recorded in the office of the county auditor as authorized in RCW 47.28.025, nothing contained in RCW 47.28.025 or 47.28.026 may be deemed to restrict or restrain in any manner the improvement, development, or other use by owners or occupiers of lands, buildings, or improvements within the limits of any proposed new or limited access highway or any proposed relocated or widened highway. Because of the uncertainties of federal aid and the state level of funding of proposed construction or improvement of state highways, plans for such improvements approved by the department shall be deemed tentative until filed with the county auditor as authorized in RCW 47.28.025 or until the department commences action to condemn or otherwise acquire the right-of-way for the highway improvements.

## 47.28.030 - Contracts—State forces—Monetary limits—Small businesses, veteran, minority, and women contractors—Rules—Work on ferry vessels and terminals, ferry vessel program.
1. [Empty]

   a. A state highway shall be constructed, altered, repaired, or improved, and improvements located on property acquired for right-of-way purposes may be repaired or renovated pending the use of such right-of-way for highway purposes, by contract or state forces. The work or portions thereof may be done by state forces when the estimated costs thereof are less than fifty thousand dollars and effective July 1, 2005, sixty thousand dollars.

   b. When delay of performance of such work would jeopardize a state highway or constitute a danger to the traveling public, the work may be done by state forces when the estimated cost thereof is less than eighty thousand dollars and effective July 1, 2005, one hundred thousand dollars.

   c. When the department of transportation determines to do the work by state forces, it shall enter a statement upon its records to that effect, stating the reasons therefor.

   d. To enable a larger number of small businesses and veteran, minority, and women contractors to effectively compete for department of transportation contracts, the department may adopt rules providing for bids and award of contracts for the performance of work, or furnishing equipment, materials, supplies, or operating services whenever any work is to be performed and the engineer's estimate indicates the cost of the work would not exceed eighty thousand dollars and effective July 1, 2005, one hundred thousand dollars.

2. The rules adopted under this section:

   a. Shall provide for competitive bids to the extent that competitive sources are available except when delay of performance would jeopardize life or property or inconvenience the traveling public; and

   b. Need not require the furnishing of a bid deposit nor a performance bond, but if a performance bond is not required then progress payments to the contractor may be required to be made based on submittal of paid invoices to substantiate proof that disbursements have been made to laborers, material suppliers, mechanics, and subcontractors from the previous partial payment; and

   c. May establish prequalification standards and procedures as an alternative to those set forth in RCW 47.28.070, but the prequalification standards and procedures under RCW 47.28.070 shall always be sufficient.

3. The department of transportation shall comply with such goals and rules as may be adopted by the office of minority and women's business enterprises to implement chapter 39.19 RCW with respect to contracts entered into under this chapter. The department may adopt such rules as may be necessary to comply with the rules adopted by the office of minority and women's business enterprises under chapter 39.19 RCW.

4. [Empty]

   a. Work for less than one hundred thousand dollars may be performed on ferry vessels and terminals by state forces.

   b. When the estimated cost of work to be performed on ferry vessels and terminals is between one hundred thousand dollars and two hundred thousand dollars, the department shall contact, by mail or electronic mail, contractors that appear on the department's small works roster as created pursuant to procedures in chapter 39.04 RCW to do specific work the contractors are qualified to do to determine if any contractor is interested and capable of doing the work. If there is a response of interest within seventy-two hours, the small works roster procedures commence. If no qualified contractors respond with interest and availability to do the work, the department may use its regular contracting procedures. If the secretary determines that the work to be completed is an emergency, procedures governing emergencies apply.

   c. The department shall hire a disinterested, third party to conduct an independent analysis to identify methods of reducing out-of-service times for vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement projects. The analysis must include options that consider consolidating work while vessels are at shipyards by having state forces perform services traditionally performed at Eagle Harbor at the shipyard and decreasing the allowable time at shipyards. The analysis must also compare the out-of-service vessel times of performing services by state forces versus contracting out those services which in turn must be used to form a recommendation as to what the threshold of work performed on ferry vessels and terminals by state forces should be. This analysis must be presented to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives by December 1, 2010.

   d. The department shall develop a proposed ferry vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program and present it to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives by December 1, 2010. The proposed program must:

      i. Improve the basis for budgeting vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement costs and for projecting those costs into a sixteen-year financial plan;

      ii. Limit the amount of planned out-of-service time to the greatest extent possible, including options associated with department staff as well as commercial shipyards; and

      iii. Be based on the service plan in the capital plan, recognizing that vessel preservation and improvement needs may vary by route.

   e. In developing the proposed ferry vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program, the department shall consider the following, related to reducing vessel out-of-service time:

      i. The costs compared to benefits of Eagle Harbor repair and maintenance facility operations options to include staffing costs and benefits in terms of reduced out-of-service time;

      ii. The maintenance requirements for on-vessel staff, including the benefits of a systemwide standard;

      iii. The costs compared to benefits of staff performing preservation or maintenance work, or both, while the vessel is underway, tied up between sailings, or not deployed;

      iv. A review of the department's vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program contracting process and contractual requirements;

      v. The costs compared to benefits of allowing for increased costs associated with expedited delivery;

      vi. A method for comparing the anticipated out-of-service time of proposed projects and other projects planned during the same construction period;

      vii. Coordination with required United States coast guard dry dockings;

      viii. A method for comparing how proposed projects relate to the service requirements of the route on which the vessel normally operates; and

      ix. A method for evaluating the ongoing maintenance and preservation costs associated with proposed improvement projects.

If the successful bidder fails to enter into the contract and furnish satisfactory bond as provided by law within twenty days from the award, exclusive of the day of the award, his or her deposit shall be forfeited to the state and deposited by the state treasurer to the credit of the motor vehicle fund, and the department may award the contract to the second lowest responsible bidder. If the second lowest responsible bidder fails to enter into the contract and furnish bond within twenty days after award to him or her, forfeiture of his or her deposit shall also be made, and the contract may be awarded to the third lowest responsible bidder, and in like manner until the contract and bond are executed by a responsible bidder to whom award is made, or further bid proposals are rejected, or the number of bid proposals are exhausted. If the contract is not executed or no contractor's bond provided within the time required, and there appear circumstances that are deemed to warrant an extension of time, the department may extend the time for execution of the contract or furnishing bond for not to exceed twenty additional days. After awarding the contract the deposits of unsuccessful bidders shall be returned, but the department may retain the deposit of the next lowest responsible bidder or bidders as it desires until such time as the contract is entered into and satisfactory bond is provided by the bidder to whom the award is ultimately made. A low bidder who claims error and fails to enter into a contract is prohibited from bidding on the same project if a second or subsequent call for bids is made for the project.

If in the opinion of the department the acceptance of the bid of the lowest responsible bidder or bidders, or on prior failure of the lowest responsible bidder or bidders the acceptance of the bid of the remaining lowest responsible bidder or bidders, will not be for the best interest of the state, it may reject all bids or all remaining bids and republish a call for bids in the same manner as for an original publication thereof.
