## 69.77.010 - Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that the process for approval of investigational drugs, biological products, and devices in the United States protects future patients from premature, ineffective, and unsafe medications and treatments over time, but the process often takes many years. Patients who have a terminal illness do not have the luxury of waiting until an investigational drug, biological product, or device receives final approval from the United States food and drug administration. The legislature further finds that patients who have a terminal illness should be permitted to pursue the preservation of their own lives by accessing available investigational drugs, biological products, and devices. The use of available investigational drugs, biological products, and devices is a decision that should be made by the patient with a terminal illness in consultation with the patient's health care provider so that the decision to use an investigational drug, biological product, or device is made with full awareness of the potential risks, benefits, and consequences to the patient and the patient's family.

The legislature, therefore, intends to allow terminally ill patients to use potentially lifesaving investigational drugs, biological products, and devices.
