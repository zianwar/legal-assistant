## 69.48.010 - Findings.
1. Abuse, fatal overdoses, and poisonings from prescription and over-the-counter medicines used in the home have emerged as an epidemic in recent years. Poisoning is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in Washington, and more than ninety percent of poisoning deaths are due to drug overdoses. Poisoning by prescription and over-the-counter medicines is also one of the most common means of suicide and suicide attempts, with poisonings involved in more than twenty-eight thousand suicide attempts between 2004 and 2013.

2. Home medicine cabinets are the most common source of prescription drugs that are diverted and misused. Studies find about seventy percent of those who abuse prescription medicines obtain the drugs from family members or friends, usually for free. People who are addicted to heroin often first abused prescription opiate medicines. Unused, unwanted, and expired medicines that accumulate in homes increase risks of drug abuse, overdoses, and preventable poisonings.

3. A safe system for the collection and disposal of unused, unwanted, and expired medicines is a key element of a comprehensive strategy to prevent prescription drug abuse, but disposing of medicines by flushing them down the toilet or placing them in the garbage can contaminate groundwater and other bodies of water, contributing to long-term harm to the environment and animal life.

4. The legislature therefore finds that it is in the interest of public health to establish a single, uniform, statewide system of regulation for safe and secure collection and disposal of medicines through drug "take-back" programs operated and funded by drug manufacturers.

Coordination efforts must include providing residents with a single toll-free telephone number and single website to access information about collection services for every approved program, including presenting all available collection sites, mail-back distribution locations, and take-back events to ensure residents are able to access the most convenient method of collection, regardless of the program operator, and must manage requests for prepaid, preaddressed mailing envelopes from covered entities and from retail pharmacies as provided in RCW 69.48.060(3)(e).

3. Pharmacies and other entities that sell medication in the state are encouraged to promote secure disposal of covered drugs through the use of one or more approved drug take-back programs.

   a. Shall conduct a survey of covered entities and a survey of pharmacists, health care providers, and veterinarians who interact with covered entities on the use of medicines after the first full year of operation of the drug take-back program, and again every two years thereafter. Survey questions must: Measure consumer awareness of the drug take-back program; assess the extent to which collection sites and other collection methods are convenient and easy to use; assess knowledge and attitudes about risks of abuse, poisonings, and overdoses from drugs used in the home; and assess covered entities' practices with respect to unused, unwanted, or expired drugs, both currently and prior to implementation of the drug take-back program; and

   b. May, upon review of results of public awareness surveys, direct a program operator for an approved drug take-back program to modify the program's promotion and outreach activities to better achieve widespread awareness among Washington state residents and health care professionals about where and how to return covered drugs to the drug take-back program.
