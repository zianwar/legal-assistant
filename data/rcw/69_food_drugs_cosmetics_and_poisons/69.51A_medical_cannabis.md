## 69.51A.005 - Purpose and intent.
1. The legislature finds that:

   a. There is medical evidence that some patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions may, under their health care professional's care, benefit from the medical use of cannabis. Some of the conditions for which cannabis appears to be beneficial include, but are not limited to:

      i. Nausea, vomiting, and cachexia associated with cancer, HIV-positive status, AIDS, hepatitis C, anorexia, and their treatments;

      ii. Severe muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other seizure and spasticity disorders;

      iii. Acute or chronic glaucoma;

      iv. Crohn's disease; and

      v. Some forms of intractable pain.

   b. Humanitarian compassion necessitates that the decision to use cannabis by patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions is a personal, individual decision, based upon their health care professional's professional medical judgment and discretion.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends that, so long as such activities are in strict compliance with this chapter:

   a. Qualifying patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions who, in the judgment of their health care professionals, may benefit from the medical use of cannabis, shall not be arrested, prosecuted, or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences under state law based solely on their medical use of cannabis, notwithstanding any other provision of law;

   b. Persons who act as designated providers to such patients shall also not be arrested, prosecuted, or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences under state law, notwithstanding any other provision of law, based solely on their assisting with the medical use of cannabis; and

   c. Health care professionals shall also not be arrested, prosecuted, or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences under state law for the proper authorization of medical use of cannabis by qualifying patients for whom, in the health care professional's professional judgment, the medical use of cannabis may prove beneficial.

3. Nothing in this chapter establishes the medical necessity or medical appropriateness of cannabis for treating terminal or debilitating medical conditions as defined in RCW 69.51A.010.

4. Nothing in this chapter diminishes the authority of correctional agencies and departments, including local governments or jails, to establish a procedure for determining when the use of cannabis would impact community safety or the effective supervision of those on active supervision for a criminal conviction, nor does it create the right to any accommodation of any medical use of cannabis in any correctional facility or jail.

## 69.51A.030 - Acts not constituting crimes or unprofessional conduct—Health care professionals not subject to penalties or liabilities.
1. The following acts do not constitute crimes under state law or unprofessional conduct under chapter 18.130 RCW, and a health care professional may not be arrested, searched, prosecuted, disciplined, or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences or liability under state law, or have real or personal property searched, seized, or forfeited pursuant to state law, notwithstanding any other provision of law as long as the health care professional complies with subsection (2) of this section:

   a. Advising a patient about the risks and benefits of medical use of cannabis or that the patient may benefit from the medical use of cannabis; or

   b. Providing a patient or designated provider meeting the criteria established under RCW 69.51A.010 with an authorization, based upon the health care professional's assessment of the patient's medical history and current medical condition, if the health care professional has complied with this chapter and he or she determines within a professional standard of care or in the individual health care professional's medical judgment the qualifying patient may benefit from the medical use of cannabis.

2. [Empty]

   a. A health care professional may provide a qualifying patient or that patient's designated provider with an authorization for the medical use of cannabis in accordance with this section.

   b. In order to authorize for the medical use of cannabis under (a) of this subsection, the health care professional must:

      i. Have a documented relationship with the patient, as a principal care provider or a specialist, relating to the diagnosis and ongoing treatment or monitoring of the patient's terminal or debilitating medical condition;

      ii. Complete an in-person physical examination of the patient or a remote physical examination of the patient if one is determined to be appropriate under (c)(iii) of this subsection;

      v. Document in the patient's medical record other measures attempted to treat the terminal or debilitating medical condition that do not involve the medical use of cannabis; and

      iii. Following an in-person physical examination to authorize the use of cannabis for medical purposes, the health care professional may determine and note in the patient's medical record that subsequent physical examinations for the purposes of renewing an authorization may occur through the use of telemedicine technology if the health care professional determines that requiring the qualifying patient to attend a physical examination in person to renew an authorization would likely result in severe hardship to the qualifying patient because of the qualifying patient's physical or emotional condition.

      iv. When renewing a qualifying patient's authorization for the medical use of cannabis, the health care professional may indicate that the qualifying patient qualifies for a compassionate care renewal of his or her registration in the medical cannabis authorization database and recognition card if the health care professional determines that requiring the qualifying patient to renew a registration in person would likely result in severe hardship to the qualifying patient because of the qualifying patient's physical or emotional condition. A compassionate care renewal of a qualifying patient's registration and recognition card allows the qualifying patient to receive renewals without the need to be physically present at a retailer and without the requirement to have a photograph taken.

      i. Accept, solicit, or offer any form of pecuniary remuneration from or to a cannabis retailer, cannabis processor, or cannabis producer;

      ii. Offer a discount or any other thing of value to a qualifying patient who is a customer of, or agrees to be a customer of, a particular cannabis retailer;

      vi. Hold an economic interest in an enterprise that produces, processes, or sells cannabis if the health care professional authorizes the medical use of cannabis.

3. The department shall develop the form for the health care professional to use as an authorization for qualifying patients and designated providers. The form shall include the qualifying patient's or designated provider's name, address, and date of birth; the health care professional's name, address, and license number; the amount of cannabis recommended for the qualifying patient; a telephone number where the authorization can be verified during normal business hours; the dates of issuance and expiration; and a statement that an authorization does not provide protection from arrest unless the qualifying patient or designated provider is also entered in the medical cannabis authorization database and holds a recognition card.

4. The appropriate health professions disciplining authority may inspect or request patient records to confirm compliance with this section. The health care professional must provide access to or produce documents, records, or other items that are within his or her possession or control within twenty-one calendar days of service of a request by the health professions disciplining authority. If the twenty-one calendar day limit results in a hardship upon the health care professional, he or she may request, for good cause, an extension not to exceed thirty additional calendar days. Failure to produce the documents, records, or other items shall result in citations and fines issued consistent with RCW 18.130.230. Failure to otherwise comply with the requirements of this section shall be considered unprofessional conduct and subject to sanctions under chapter 18.130 RCW.

5. After a health care professional authorizes a qualifying patient for the medical use of cannabis, he or she may discuss with the qualifying patient how to use cannabis and the types of products the qualifying patient should seek from a retail outlet.
