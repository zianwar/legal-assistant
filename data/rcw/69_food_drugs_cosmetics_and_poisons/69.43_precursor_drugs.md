The evidence must include the furnishing of a valid scientific study, conducted by an independent, professional laboratory and evincing professional quality chemical analysis. Factors to be considered in whether a product should be excluded from this section include but are not limited to:

   a. Ease with which the product can be converted to methamphetamine;

   b. Ease with which ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine is extracted from the substance and whether it forms an emulsion, salt, or other form;

   c. Whether the product contains a "molecular lock" that renders it incapable of being converted into methamphetamine;

   d. Presence of other ingredients that render the product less likely to be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine; and

   e. Any pertinent data that can be used to determine the risk of the substance being used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine or any other controlled substance.

8. Nothing in this section applies:

   a. To any product containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine, or their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers that is not the only active ingredient and that is in liquid, liquid capsule, or gel capsule form;

   b. To the sale of a product that may only be sold upon the presentation of a prescription;

The pharmacy, shopkeeper, or itinerant vendor may not complete the sale if the system generates a stop sale alert, except as permitted in RCW 69.43.165.

   b. If a pharmacy, shopkeeper, or itinerant vendor selling a nonprescription drug containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine, or their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers experiences mechanical or electronic failure of the electronic sales tracking system and is unable to comply with the electronic sales tracking requirement, he or she shall maintain a written log or an alternative electronic recordkeeping mechanism until such time as he or she is able to comply with the electronic sales tracking requirement.

A pharmacy, shopkeeper, or itinerant vendor may withdraw from participating in the electronic sales tracking system if the system is no longer being furnished without cost for accessing the system. A pharmacy, shopkeeper, or itinerant vendor who withdraws from the electronic sales tracking system is subject to the same requirements as a pharmacy, shopkeeper, or itinerant vendor who has been granted an exemption under (c) of this subsection.

   e. For the purposes of this subsection (4) and RCW 69.43.165:

      i. "Cost for accessing the system" means costs relating to:

         A.  Access to the web-based electronic sales tracking software, including inputting and retrieving data;
