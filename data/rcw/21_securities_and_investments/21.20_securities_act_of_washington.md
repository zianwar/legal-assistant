3. That the investment adviser, if a partnership, shall notify the other party to the contract of any change in the membership of the partnership within a reasonable time after the change.

"Assignment", as used in subsection (2) of this section, includes any direct or indirect transfer or hypothecation of an investment advisory contract by the assignor or of a controlling block of the assignor's outstanding voting securities by a security holder of the assignor; but, if the investment adviser is a partnership, no assignment of an investment advisory contract is considered to result from the death or withdrawal of a minority of the members of the investment adviser having only a minority interest in the business of the investment adviser, or from the admission to the investment adviser of one or more members who, after admission, will be only a minority of the members and will have only a minority interest in the business.

When a salesperson begins or terminates employment or association with an issuer or registered broker-dealer, the salesperson and the issuer or broker-dealer shall promptly notify the director.

6. A person who, directly or indirectly, controls a person not in compliance with any part of this section may also be sanctioned to the same extent as the noncomplying person, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the conduct constituting the violation or cause of action.

8. In any action under subsection (1) of this section, the director may enter an order requiring an accounting, restitution, and disgorgement, including interest at the legal rate under RCW 4.56.110.

9. The director shall immediately suspend the license or certificate of a person who has been certified pursuant to RCW 74.20A.320 by the department of social and health services as a person who is not in compliance with a support order. If the person has continued to meet all other requirements for reinstatement during the suspension, reissuance of the license or certificate shall be automatic upon the director's receipt of a release issued by the department of social and health services stating that the licensee is in compliance with the order.

Upon failure to receive the required notification and post-effective amendment with respect to the price amendment referred to in RCW 21.20.190, the director may enter a stop order, without notice of hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until compliance with RCW 21.20.190, if the director promptly notified the registrant by telephone, facsimile, or electronic transmission (and promptly confirms by letter or facsimile when the director notifies by telephone) of the issuance of the order. If the registrant proves compliance with the requirements as to notice and post-effective amendment, the stop order is void as of the time of its entry. The director may by rule or otherwise waive either or both of the conditions specified in RCW 21.20.190 (2) and (3). If the federal registration statement or other filing becomes effective before all these conditions are satisfied and they are not waived, the registration statement automatically becomes effective as soon as all the conditions are satisfied. If the registrant advises the director of the date when the federal registration statement or other filing is expected to become effective the director shall promptly advise the registrant by telephone, electronic transmission, or facsimile, at the registrant's expense, whether all the conditions are satisfied and whether the director then contemplates the institution of a proceeding under RCW 21.20.280 and 21.20.300; but this advice by the director does not preclude the institution of such a proceeding at any time.

2. Any person who buys a security in violation of the provisions of RCW 21.20.010 is liable to the person selling the security to him or her, who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the security, together with any income received on the security, upon tender of the consideration received, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees, or if the security cannot be recovered, for damages. Damages are the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it, and any income received on the security, less the consideration received for the security, plus interest at eight percent per annum from the date of disposition, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees.

3. Every person who directly or indirectly controls a seller or buyer liable under subsection (1) or (2) above, every partner, officer, director or person who occupies a similar status or performs a similar function of such seller or buyer, every employee of such a seller or buyer who materially aids in the transaction, and every broker-dealer, salesperson, or person exempt under the provisions of RCW 21.20.040 who materially aids in the transaction is also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the seller or buyer, unless such person sustains the burden of proof that he or she did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. There is contribution as in cases of contract among the several persons so liable.

4. [Empty]

   a. Every cause of action under this statute survives the death of any person who might have been a plaintiff or defendant.

No person may sue under this section if the buyer or seller receives a written rescission offer, which has been passed upon by the director before suit and at a time when he or she owned the security, to refund the consideration paid together with interest at eight percent per annum from the date of payment, less the amount of any income received on the security in the case of a buyer, or plus the amount of income received on the security in the case of a seller.

5. No person who has made or engaged in the performance of any contract in violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, or who has acquired any purported right under any such contract with knowledge of the facts by reason of which its making or performance was in violation, may base any suit on the contract. Any condition, stipulation, or provision binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or any rule or order hereunder is void.

6. Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment.

7. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (6) of this section, if an initial offer or sale of securities that are exempt from registration under RCW 21.20.310 is made by this state or its agencies, political subdivisions, municipal or quasi-municipal corporations, or other instrumentality of one or more of the foregoing and is in violation of RCW 21.20.010(2), and any such issuer, member of the governing body, committee member, public officer, director, employee, or agent of such issuer acting on its behalf, or person in control of such issuer, member of the governing body, committee member, public officer, director, employee, or agent of such person acting on its behalf, materially aids in the offer or sale, such person is liable to the purchaser of the security only if the purchaser establishes scienter on the part of the defendant. The word "employee" or the word "agent," as such words are used in this subsection, do not include a bond counsel or an underwriter. Under no circumstances whatsoever shall this subsection be applied to require purchasers to establish scienter on the part of bond counsels or underwriters.

Any person aggrieved by a final order of the director may obtain a review of the order in the county in which that person resides or in any other court of competent jurisdiction by filing in court, within sixty days after the entry of the order, a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith served upon the director, and thereupon the director shall certify and file in court a copy of the filing, testimony, and other evidence upon which the order was entered. When these have been filed, the court has exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, enforce, or set aside the order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the director or there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The findings of the director as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence in the hearing before the director, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the director and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such conditions as the court may consider proper. The director may modify his or her findings by reason of the additional evidence so taken; and the director shall file any modified or new findings, which if supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive, and any recommendation for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The commencement of proceedings under this section does not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the director's order.
