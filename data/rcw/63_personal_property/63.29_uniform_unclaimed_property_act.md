5. If the laws of this state or the terms of the life insurance policy require the company to give notice to the insured or owner that an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision has been exercised and the notice, given to an insured or owner whose last known address according to the records of the company is in this state, is undeliverable, the company shall make a reasonable search to ascertain the policyholder's correct address to which the notice must be mailed.

1. Except as provided in subsections (2) and (5) of this section, stock or other intangible ownership interest in a business association, the existence of which is evidenced by records available to the association, is presumed abandoned and, with respect to the interest, the association is the holder, if a dividend, distribution, or other sum payable as a result of the interest has remained unclaimed by the owner for three years and the owner within three years has not:

If five dividends, distributions, or other sums are paid during the three-year period, the period leading to a presumption of abandonment commences on the date payment of the first such unclaimed dividend, distribution, or other sum became due and payable. If five dividends, distributions, or other sums are not paid during the presumptive period, the period continues to run until there have been five dividends, distributions, or other sums that have not been claimed by the owner.

3. The running of the three-year period of abandonment ceases immediately upon the occurrence of a communication referred to in subsection (1) of this section. If any future dividend, distribution, or other sum payable to the owner as a result of the interest is subsequently not claimed by the owner, a new period of abandonment commences and relates back to the time a subsequent dividend, distribution, or other sum became due and payable.

4. At the time any interest is presumed abandoned under this section, any dividend, distribution, or other sum then held for or owing to the owner as a result of the interest, and not previously presumed abandoned, is presumed abandoned.

The three-year period from the return of official shareholder notifications or communications shall commence from the earlier of the return of the second such mailing or the date the holder discontinues mailings to the shareholder.

1. [Empty]

   a. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a person who is required to file a report under RCW 63.29.170 must pay or deliver to the department all abandoned property required to be reported at the time of filing the report. Beginning July 1, 2016, holders who are required to file a report electronically under this chapter must remit payments under this section by electronic funds transfer or other form of electronic payment acceptable to the department. However, the department, upon request or its own initiative, may relieve any holder or class of holders from the electronic payment requirement under this subsection for good cause as determined by the department.

   b. For purposes of this subsection, "good cause" means:

      i. A circumstance or condition exists that, in the department's judgment, prevents the holder from remitting payments due under this section electronically; or

      ii. The department determines that relief from the electronic payment requirement under this subsection supports the efficient or effective administration of this chapter.

2. [Empty]

   a. Counties, cities, towns, and other municipal and quasi-municipal corporations that hold funds representing warrants canceled pursuant to RCW 36.22.100 and 39.56.040, uncashed checks, and property tax overpayments or refunds may retain the funds until the owner notifies them and establishes ownership as provided in RCW 63.29.135. Counties, cities, towns, or other municipal or quasi-municipal corporations must provide to the department a report of property it is holding pursuant to this section. The report must identify the property and owner in the manner provided in RCW 63.29.170 and the department must publish the information as provided in RCW 63.29.180.

   b. [Empty]

      i. A public transportation authority that holds funds representing value on abandoned fare cards may retain the funds until the owner notifies the authority and establishes ownership as provided in RCW 63.29.135.

      ii. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(b), "public transportation authority" means a municipality, as defined in RCW 35.58.272, a regional transit authority authorized by chapter 81.112 RCW, a public mass transportation system authorized by chapter 47.60 RCW, or a city transportation authority authorized by chapter 35.95A RCW.

   b. If the owner establishes the right to receive the abandoned property to the satisfaction of the holder before the property has been delivered or it appears that for some other reason the presumption of abandonment is erroneous, the holder need not pay or deliver the property to the department, and the property will no longer be presumed abandoned. In that case, the holder must file with the department a verified written explanation of the proof of claim or of the error in the presumption of abandonment.

4. The holder of an interest under RCW 63.29.100 must deliver a duplicate certificate or other evidence of ownership if the holder does not issue certificates of ownership to the department. Upon delivery of a duplicate certificate to the department, the holder and any transfer agent, registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder in executing or delivering the duplicate certificate is relieved of all liability of every kind in accordance with RCW 63.29.200 to every person, including any person acquiring the original certificate or the duplicate of the certificate issued to the department, for any losses or damages resulting to any person by the issuance and delivery to the department of the duplicate certificate.

## 63.29.192 - Penalty and interest paid in excess—Refunds—Returns. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. [Empty]

   a. If, upon receipt of an application by a holder for a refund or return of property, or upon an examination of the report or records of any holder, it is determined by the department that any amount, interest, or penalty has been paid in excess of that properly due under this chapter or that any property was delivered to the department under this chapter in error, then with the exception of amounts delivered by the department to a claimant under RCW 63.29.240, the excess amount must be refunded to the holder, or the property delivered in error returned to the holder, as the case may be.

   b. [Empty]

      i. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 63.29.200(2) or this section, no refund or return of property may be made for any amount or property paid or delivered, or for any interest or penalty paid, more than six years after the end of the calendar year in which the payment or delivery occurred.

      ii. The expiration of the limitations period in this subsection will not bar a refund or the return of property if a complete application for such refund or return of property was received by the department before the expiration of such limitations period.

2. The execution of a written waiver signed by the holder and the department will extend the time for making a refund of any amounts paid, or a return of property delivered in error, during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, a complete application for refund or return of such amounts or property is made by the holder or the department discovers a refund is due or a return of property under this section is required.

3. For purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, an application for a refund or return of property is complete if it includes information the department deems sufficient to substantiate the holder's claim for a refund or return of property. If the department receives an incomplete application before the expiration of the limitations period in subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section or before the expiration of an applicable waiver period as authorized under subsection (2) of this section, the department must provide the holder written notice of the deficiencies of information in the application and grant the holder thirty days from the date of such notice to provide sufficient documentation to substantiate the holder's claim for a refund or return of property. The department may, at its sole discretion, grant a holder up to an additional ninety days to substantiate its claim and specify in a written notice the expiration date of such additional period. If the holder provides sufficient substantiation documentation to the department within the additional time granted but after the expiration of the limitations period in subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section or an applicable waiver period as authorized under subsection (2) of this section, the holder will be deemed to have provided a complete application before the expiration of such limitations or waiver period. This subsection (3) may not be interpreted as governing the administration of applications for refund or return of property other than for purposes of the limitations period established in this section.

4. Any such refunds must be made by means of vouchers approved by the department and by the issuance of state warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the legislature may provide. However, persons who are required to pay amounts due under this chapter electronically must have any refunds paid by electronic funds transfer if the department has the necessary account information to facilitate a refund by electronic funds transfer.

5. Any judgment for which a recovery is granted by any court of competent jurisdiction, not appealed from, for amounts, penalties, or interest paid by the holder, and costs, in a suit by any holder must be paid in the same manner, as provided in subsection (4) of this section, upon the filing with the department of a certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.

6. Interest at the rate computed under RCW 82.32.050(2) must be added to the amount of any refund allowed by the department or any court. Interest must be computed from the date the department received the excess payment, until the date the refund is issued.

A petition for review under this section is timely if received in writing by the department before the due date of the assessment, including any extension of the due date granted by the department, or in the case of a refund or return application, thirty days after the department rejects the application in writing, regardless of any subsequent action by the department to reconsider its initial decision. The period for filing a petition for review under this section may be extended as provided in a rule adopted by the department under chapter 34.05 RCW or upon a written agreement signed by the holder and the department.

2. An appeal under this section must be made within:

   b. Both parties are entitled to subpoena the attendance of witnesses as in other civil actions and to produce evidence that is competent, relevant, and material to determine the correct amount due, if any, that should be paid by the plaintiff.

   c. Either party may seek appellate review in the same manner as other civil actions are appealed to the appellate courts.

5. An appeal may be maintained under this section without the need for the plaintiff to first:

   a. Protest against the payment of any amount due or reportable under this chapter or to make any demand to have such amount refunded or returned; or

   b. Petition the department for a refund, return of property, or a review of its action as authorized in RCW 63.29.193.

6. No court action or proceeding of any kind may be maintained by the plaintiff to recover any amount paid, delivered, or reported to the department under this chapter, except as provided in this section or as may be available to the plaintiff under RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.

7. No appeal may be maintained under this section with respect to matters reviewed by the department under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW.

4. No agreement under this section may include any indemnification of any holder for amounts or property that has not been paid or delivered to the department.

## 63.29.200 - Custody by state—Holder relieved from liability—Reimbursement of holder paying claim—Reclaiming for owner—Defense of holder—Payment of safe deposit box or repository charges. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. Upon the payment or delivery of property to the department, the state assumes custody and responsibility for the safekeeping of the property. A person who pays or delivers property to the department in good faith is relieved of all liability to the extent of the value of the property paid or delivered for any claim then existing or which thereafter may arise or be made in respect to the property.

2. A holder who has paid money to the department pursuant to this chapter may make payment to any person appearing to the holder to be entitled to payment and, upon filing proof of payment and proof that the payee was entitled thereto, the department shall promptly reimburse the holder for the payment without imposing any fee or other charge. If reimbursement is sought for a payment made on an instrument, including a travelers check or money order, the holder must be reimbursed under this subsection upon filing proof that the instrument was duly presented and that payment was made to a person who appeared to the holder to be entitled to payment. The holder must be reimbursed for payment made under this subsection even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was barred under RCW 63.29.290(1).

3. A holder who has delivered property (including a certificate of any interest in a business association) other than money to the department pursuant to this chapter may reclaim the property if still in the possession of the department, without paying any fee or other charge, upon filing proof that the owner has claimed the property from the holder.

4. The department may accept the holder's affidavit as sufficient proof of the facts that entitle the holder to recover money and property under this section.

5. If the holder pays or delivers property to the department in good faith and thereafter another person claims the property from the holder or another state claims the money or property under its laws relating to escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property, the department, upon written notice of the claim, shall defend the holder against the claim and indemnify the holder against any liability on the claim.

6. For the purposes of this section, "good faith" means that:

   a. Payment or delivery was made in a reasonable attempt to comply with this chapter;

   b. The person delivering the property was not a fiduciary then in breach of trust in respect to the property and had a reasonable basis for believing, based on the facts then known to him or her, that the property was abandoned for the purposes of this chapter; and

   c. There is no showing that the records pursuant to which the delivery was made did not meet reasonable commercial standards of practice in the industry.

7. Property removed from a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository is received by the department subject to the holder's right under this subsection to be reimbursed for the actual cost of the opening and to any valid lien or contract providing for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent or storage charges. The department shall reimburse or pay the holder out of the proceeds remaining after deducting the department's selling cost. The liability of the department for this reimbursement to the holder shall be limited to the proceeds of the sale of the property remaining after the deduction of the department's costs.

However, if the department receives a claim for securities and the department has not ordered those securities to be sold as of the time the claim is received by the department, the claimant is entitled to receive either the securities delivered to the department by the holder, or the proceeds received from the sale, less any amounts deducted pursuant to RCW 63.29.230(2).

      ii. With respect to securities that, in the judgment of the department, cannot be sold or are not cost-effective to sell and that remain in the possession of the department, a person making a claim under this chapter is only entitled to receive the securities delivered to the department by the holder.

   d. No person has any claim under this chapter against the state, the holder, any transfer agent, registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder for or on account of any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the department.

If the property claimed was interest-bearing to the owner on the date of surrender by the holder, the department also must pay interest at the legal rate or any lesser rate the property earned while in the possession of the holder. Interest begins to accrue when the property is delivered to the department and ceases on the earlier of the expiration of ten years after delivery or the date on which payment is made to the owner. No interest on interest-bearing property is payable for any period before June 30, 1983.

4. Any holder who pays the owner for property that has been delivered to the state and which, if claimed from the department, would be subject to subsection (3) of this section must add interest as provided in subsection (3) of this section. The added interest must be repaid to the holder by the department in the same manner as the principal.

## 63.29.250 - Claim of another state to recover property—Procedure. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. At any time after property has been paid or delivered to the department under this chapter another state may recover the property if:

   a. The property was subjected to custody by this state because the records of the holder did not reflect the last known address of the apparent owner when the property was presumed abandoned under this chapter, and the other state establishes that the last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property was in that state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;

   b. The last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property, as reflected by the records of the holder, is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;

   c. The records of the holder were erroneous in that they did not accurately reflect the actual owner of the property and the last known address of the actual owner is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;

   d. The property was subjected to custody by this state under RCW 63.29.030(6) and under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state; or

   e. The property is the sum payable on a travelers check, money order, or other similar instrument that was subjected to custody by this state under RCW 63.29.040, and the instrument was purchased in the other state, and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or became subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.

2. The claim of another state to recover escheated or abandoned property must be presented in a form prescribed by the department, who shall decide the claim within ninety days after it is presented. The department shall allow the claim if it determines that the other state is entitled to the abandoned property under subsection (1) of this section.

3. The department shall require a state, before recovering property under this section, to agree to indemnify this state and its officers and employees against any liability on a claim for the property.

1. The department may decline to receive any property reported under this chapter which it considers to have a value less than the expense of giving notice and of sale. If the department elects not to receive custody of the property, the holder shall be notified within one hundred twenty days after filing the report required under RCW 63.29.170. The holder then may dispose of the property in such manner as it sees fit. No action or proceeding may be maintained against the holder for or on account of any action taken by the holder pursuant to this subsection with respect to the property.

2. A holder, with the written consent of the department and upon conditions and terms prescribed by it, may report and deliver property before the property is presumed abandoned.

## 63.29.300 - Requests for reports and examination of records. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. The department may require any person who has not filed a report to file a verified report stating whether or not the person is holding any unclaimed property reportable or deliverable under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter requires reporting of property which is not subject to payment or delivery.

2. The department, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, may examine the records of any person to determine whether the person has complied with the provisions of this chapter. The department may conduct the examination even if the person believes it is not in possession of any property reportable or deliverable under this chapter.

3. If a person is treated under RCW 63.29.120 as the holder of the property only insofar as the interest of the business association in the property is concerned, the department, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, may examine the records of the person if the department has given the notice required by subsection (2) of this section to both the person and the business association at least ninety days before the examination.

4. Material obtained by any person during any examination authorized under this chapter, or whether the holder was, is being, or will be examined or subject to an examination, is confidential information and may not be disclosed to any person except as provided in RCW 63.29.380.

5. If an examination of the records of a person results in the disclosure of property reportable and payable or deliverable under this chapter, the department must assess against the person the amount that should have been reported and paid as determined or approved by the department. An assessment must also include a demand to deliver any property that should have been reported and delivered to the department under this chapter. The assessment must include interest and penalties as provided in RCW 63.29.340. The department may assess the cost of the examination against the holder at the rate of one hundred forty dollars a day for each examiner, but in no case may the charges exceed the lesser of three thousand dollars or the value of the property found to be reportable and payable or deliverable. No assessment for costs may be imposed when the person proves that failure to report and deliver property was inadvertent. The cost of examination made pursuant to subsection (3) of this section may be imposed only against the business association.

6. If a holder fails after June 30, 1983, to maintain the records required by RCW 63.29.310 and the records of the holder available for the periods subject to this chapter are insufficient to permit the preparation of a report, the department may assess such amounts as may reasonably be estimated from any available records.

7. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, all amounts and property identified in any assessment issued by the department under this section must be paid or delivered to the department within thirty days of issuance.

2. Any business association that sells in this state its travelers checks, money orders, or other similar written instruments, other than third-party bank checks on which the business association is directly liable, or that provides such instruments to others for sale in this state, shall maintain a record of those instruments while they remain outstanding, indicating the state and date of issue for three years after the date the property is reportable.

1. The department may enter into agreements with other states to exchange information needed to enable this or another state to audit or otherwise determine unclaimed property that it or another state may be entitled to subject to a claim of custody. The department by rule may require the reporting of information needed to enable compliance with agreements made pursuant to this section and prescribe the form.

2. To avoid conflicts between the department's procedures and the procedures of administrators in other jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, the department, so far as is consistent with the purposes, policies, and provisions of this chapter, before adopting, amending or repealing rules, shall advise and consult with administrators in other jurisdictions that enact substantially the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act and take into consideration the rules of administrators in other jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act.

3. The department may join with other states to seek enforcement of this chapter against any person who is or may be holding property reportable under this chapter.

4. At the request of another state, the attorney general of this state may bring an action in the name of the administrator of the other state in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the unclaimed property laws of the other state against a holder in this state of property subject to escheat or a claim of abandonment by the other state, if the other state has agreed to pay expenses incurred by the attorney general in bringing the action.

5. The department may request that the attorney general of another state or any other person bring an action in the name of the department in the other state. This state shall pay all expenses including attorney's fees in any action under this subsection. The department may agree to pay the person bringing the action attorney's fees based in whole or in part on a percentage of the value of any property recovered in the action. Any expenses paid pursuant to this subsection may not be deducted from the amount that is subject to the claim by the owner under this chapter.

## 63.29.340 - Interest and penalties. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. A person who fails to pay or deliver property when due is required to pay to the department interest at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(2) from the date the property should have been paid or delivered until the property is paid or delivered. However, the department must waive or cancel interest imposed under this subsection if:

   a. The department finds that the failure to pay or deliver the property within the time prescribed by this chapter was the result of circumstances beyond the person's control sufficient for waiver or cancellation of interest under RCW 82.32.105;

   b. The failure to timely pay or deliver the property within the time prescribed by this chapter was the direct result of written instructions given to the person by the department; or

   c. The extension of a due date for payment or delivery under an assessment issued by the department was not at the person's request and was for the sole convenience of the department.

2. If a person fails to file any report or to pay or deliver any amounts or property when due under a report required under this chapter, there is assessed a penalty equal to ten percent of the amount unpaid and the value of any property not delivered.

3. If an examination results in an assessment for amounts unpaid or property not delivered, there is assessed a penalty equal to ten percent of the amount unpaid and the value of any property not delivered.

4. If a person fails to pay or deliver to the department by the due date any amounts or property due under an assessment issued by the department to the person, there is assessed an additional penalty of five percent of the amount unpaid and the value of any property not delivered.

5. Penalties under subsections (2) through (4) of this section may be waived or canceled only if the department finds that the failure to pay or deliver within the time prescribed by this chapter was the result of circumstances beyond the person's control sufficient for waiver or cancellation of penalties under RCW 82.32.105.

6. If a person willfully fails to file a report or to provide written notice to apparent owners as required under this chapter, the department may assess a civil penalty of one hundred dollars for each day the report is withheld or the notice is not sent, but not more than five thousand dollars.

7. If a holder, having filed a report, failed to file the report electronically as required by RCW 63.29.170, or failed to pay electronically any amounts due under the report as required by RCW 63.29.190, the department must assess a penalty equal to five percent of the amount payable or deliverable under the report, unless the department grants the taxpayer relief from the electronic filing and payment requirements. Total penalties assessed under this subsection may not exceed five percent of the amount payable and value of property deliverable under the report.

8. The penalties imposed in this section are cumulative.
