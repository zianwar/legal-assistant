## 63.14.043 - Retail installment contracts—Purchase of motor vehicle—Secondary products.
1. If a retail installment contract for the purchase of a motor vehicle meets the requirements of this chapter and meets the requirements of any federal law applicable to a retail installment contract for the purchase of a motor vehicle, the retail installment contract shall be accepted for consideration by any lender, except for lenders licensed and regulated under the provisions of chapter 31.04 RCW, to whom application for credit relating to the retail installment contract is made.

2. If a retail installment contract for the purchase of a motor vehicle includes the purchase of a secondary product, a lender who shares common control with a brand owner may not directly or indirectly require, as a condition of acceptance of assignment of the retail installment contract, that the buyer purchase a secondary product from a particular provider, administrator, or insurer. A violation of this subsection is deemed to affect the public interest and constitutes an unlawful and unfair practice under chapter 19.86 RCW.

3. For the purposes of this section, "secondary product," "common control," and "brand owner" have the same meanings as provided in RCW 46.96.196.

   a. If the retail installment transaction was entered into by the buyer and solicited in person or by a commercial telephone solicitation as defined by chapter 20, Laws of 1989 by the seller or his or her representative at a place other than the seller's address, which may be his or her main or branch office, shown on the contract; and

   b. If the buyer returns goods received or makes them available to the seller as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section.

2. In the event of cancellation pursuant to this section:

   a. The seller shall, without request, refund to the buyer within ten days after such cancellation all deposits, including any down payment, made under the contract or charge agreement and shall return all goods traded in to the seller on account or in contemplation of the contract less any reasonable costs actually incurred in making ready for sale the goods so traded in;
