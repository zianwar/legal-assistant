## 9A.58.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that:

1. Washington state recognizes the importance of protecting

its citizens from unwanted wireless surveillance.

2. Enhanced drivers' licenses and enhanced identicards are intended to facilitate efficient travel at land and sea borders between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, not to facilitate the profiling and tracking of individuals.

3. Easy access to the information found on enhanced drivers' licenses and enhanced identicards could facilitate the commission of other unwanted offenses, such as identity theft.

## 9A.58.030 - Violation—Consumer protection act.
The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying chapter 19.86 RCW.

\[ [2008 c 200 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2729-S.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20200%20§%204); \]
