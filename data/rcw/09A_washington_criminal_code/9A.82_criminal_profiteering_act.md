If a subsequent reversal of the conviction occurs, any judgment that was based upon that conviction may be reopened upon motion of the defendant.

7. The initiation of civil proceedings under this section shall be commenced within three years after discovery of the pattern of criminal profiteering activity or after the pattern should reasonably have been discovered or, in the case of an offense that is defined in RCW 9A.40.100, within three years after the final disposition of any criminal charges relating to the offense, whichever is later.

The attorney general or county prosecuting attorney may, in a civil action brought pursuant to this section, file with the clerk of the superior court a certificate stating that the case is of special public importance. A copy of that certificate shall be furnished immediately by the clerk to the presiding chief judge of the superior court in which the action is pending and, upon receipt of the copy, the judge shall immediately designate a judge to hear and determine the action.

The notice shall identify the action, the person, and the person's attorney. Service of the notice does not limit or otherwise affect the right of the state to maintain an action under this section or intervene in a pending action nor does it authorize the person to name the state or the attorney general as a party to the action.

11. Except in cases filed by a county prosecuting attorney, the attorney general may, upon timely application, intervene in any civil action or proceeding brought under this section if the attorney general certifies that in the attorney general's opinion the action is of special public importance.

12. In addition to the attorney general's right to intervene as a party in any action under this section, the attorney general may appear as amicus curiae in any proceeding in which a claim under this section has been asserted or in which a court is interpreting RCW 9A.82.010, 9A.82.080, 9A.82.090, 9A.82.110, or 9A.82.120, or this section.

13. A private civil action under this section does not limit any other civil or criminal action under this chapter or any other provision. Private civil remedies provided under this section are supplemental and not mutually exclusive.

14. Upon motion by the defendant, the court may authorize the sale or transfer of assets subject to an order or lien authorized by this chapter for the purpose of paying actual attorney's fees and costs of defense. The motion shall specify the assets for which sale or transfer is sought and shall be accompanied by the defendant's sworn statement that the defendant has no other assets available for such purposes. No order authorizing such sale or transfer may be entered unless the court finds that the assets involved are not subject to possible forfeiture under RCW 9A.82.100(4)(f). Prior to disposition of the motion, the court shall notify the state of the assets sought to be sold or transferred and shall hear argument on the issue of whether the assets are subject to forfeiture under RCW 9A.82.100(4)(f). Such a motion may be made from time to time and shall be heard by the court on an expedited basis.

15. In an action brought under subsection (1)(a) and (b)(i) of this section, either party has the right to a jury trial.

3. The attorney general or the county prosecuting attorney filing the lien may amend a lien filed under this section at any time by filing an amended criminal profiteering lien in accordance with this section that identifies the prior lien amended.

4. The attorney general or the county prosecuting attorney filing the lien shall, as soon as practical after filing a criminal profiteering lien, furnish to any person named in the lien a notice of the filing of the lien. Failure to furnish notice under this subsection does not invalidate or otherwise affect a criminal profiteering lien filed in accordance with this section.

   a. A criminal profiteering lien is perfected against interests in personal property in the same manner as a security interest in like property pursuant to RCW 62A.9A-301 through 62A.9A-316 or as otherwise required to perfect a security interest in like property under applicable law. In the case of perfection by filing, the state shall file, in lieu of a financing statement in the form prescribed by RCW 62A.9A-502, a notice of lien in substantially the following form:

NOTICE OF LIENPursuant to RCW 9A.82.120, the state of Washington claims a criminal profiteering lien on all real and personal property of: Name:. . . .  Address:. . . .  . . . .  State of Washington . . . . By (authorized signature)

Name:

By (authorized signature)

On receipt of such a notice from the state, a filing officer shall, without payment of filing fee, file and index the notice as if it were a financing statement naming the state as secured party and the defendant as debtor.

   b. A criminal profiteering lien is perfected against interests in real property by filing the lien in the office where a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded. The filing officer shall file and index the criminal profiteering lien, without payment of a filing fee, in the same manner as a mortgage.

6. The filing of a criminal profiteering lien in accordance with this section creates a lien in favor of the state in:

   a. Any interest of the defendant, in real property situated in the county in which the lien is filed, then maintained, or thereafter acquired in the name of the defendant identified in the lien;

   b. Any interest of the defendant, in personal property situated in this state, then maintained or thereafter acquired in the name of the defendant identified in the lien; and

   c. Any property identified in the lien to the extent of the defendant's interest therein.

7. The lien created in favor of the state in accordance with this section, when filed or otherwise perfected as provided in subsection (5) of this section, has, with respect to any of the property described in subsection (6) of this section, the same priority determined pursuant to the laws of this state as a mortgage or security interest given for value (but not a purchase money security interest) and perfected in the same manner with respect to such property; except that any lien perfected pursuant to Title 60 RCW by any person who, in the ordinary course of his or her business, furnishes labor, services, or materials, or rents, leases, or otherwise supplies equipment, without knowledge of the criminal profiteering lien, is superior to the criminal profiteering lien.

8. Upon entry of judgment in favor of the state, the state may proceed to execute thereon as in the case of any other judgment, except that in order to preserve the state's lien priority as provided in this section the state shall, in addition to such other notice as is required by law, give at least thirty days' notice of the execution to any person possessing at the time the notice is given, an interest recorded subsequent to the date the state's lien was perfected.

9. Upon the entry of a final judgment in favor of the state providing for forfeiture of property to the state, the title of the state to the property:

   a. In the case of real property or a beneficial interest in real property, relates back to the date of filing the criminal profiteering lien or, if no criminal profiteering lien is filed, then to the date of recording of the final judgment or the abstract thereof; or

   b. In the case of personal property or a beneficial interest in personal property, relates back to the date the personal property was seized by the state, or the date of filing of a criminal profiteering lien in accordance with this section, whichever is earlier, but if the property was not seized and no criminal profiteering lien was filed then to the date the final judgment was filed with the department of licensing and, if the personal property is an aircraft, with the federal aviation administration.

   c. If requested by the attorney general or county prosecuting attorney, a copy of the trust agreement or other instrument under which the trustee holds legal or record title to the real property.

2.

The attorney general or county prosecuting attorney may bring a civil proceeding in superior court against the trustee to recover from the trustee the amounts set forth in RCW 9A.82.150. In addition to amounts recovered under RCW 9A.82.150, the attorney general or county prosecuting attorney also may recover its investigative costs and attorneys' fees.

3. The recording of a lien notice does not affect the use to which real property or a beneficial interest owned by the person named in the lien notice may be put or the right of the person to receive any avails, rents, or other proceeds resulting from the use and ownership except the sale of the property, until a judgment of forfeiture is entered.

4. This section does not apply to any conveyance by a trustee under a court order unless the court order is entered in an action between the trustee and the beneficiary.

5. Notwithstanding that a trustee is served with notice as provided in subsection (1) of this section, this section does not apply to a conveyance by a trustee required under the terms of any trust agreement in effect before service of such notice on the trustee.

The attorney general or county prosecuting attorney filing the lien notice may release in whole or in part any lien notice or may release any specific property or beneficial interest from the lien notice upon such terms and conditions as the attorney general or county prosecuting attorney considers appropriate and shall release any lien upon the dismissal of the action which is the basis of the lien or satisfaction of the judgment of the court in the action or other final disposition of the claim evidenced by the lien. A release of a lien notice executed by the attorney general or county prosecuting attorney shall be recorded in the official records in which the lien notice covering that property was recorded.

At the hearing, the court shall take evidence on the issue of whether any property or beneficial interest owned by the person is covered by the lien notice or otherwise subject to forfeiture under RCW 9A.82.120. If the person shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the lien notice is not applicable to the person or that any property or beneficial interest owned by the person is not subject to forfeiture under RCW 9A.82.120, the court shall enter a judgment extinguishing the lien notice or releasing the property or beneficial interest from the lien notice.

   c.

The proceeds resulting from the sale of the real property or beneficial interest shall be deposited with the court, subject to the further order of the court.

   d. At any time after filing of a lien, the court may release from the lien any property upon application by the defendant and posting of security equal to the value of the property to be released.
