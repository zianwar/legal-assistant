## 32.24.010 - Liquidation of solvent bank.
If the trustees of any solvent mutual savings bank deem it necessary or expedient to close the business of such bank, they may, by affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the whole number of trustees, at a meeting called for that purpose, of which one month's notice has been given, either personally or by mailing such notice to the post office address of each trustee, declare by resolution their determination to close such business and pay the moneys due depositors and creditors and to surrender the corporate franchise. Subject to the approval and under the direction of the director, such savings bank may adopt any lawful plan for closing up its affairs, as nearly as may be in accordance with the original plan and objects.

## 32.24.020 - Procedure to liquidate and dissolve.
When the trustees, acting under the provisions of RCW 32.24.010, have paid the sums due respectively to all creditors and depositors, who, after such notice as the director shall prescribe, claim the money due and their deposits, the trustees shall make a transcript or statement from the books in the bank of the names of all depositors and creditors who have not claimed or have not received the balance of the credit due them, and of the sums due them, respectively, and shall file such transcript with the director and pay over and transfer all such unclaimed and unpaid deposits, credits, and moneys to the director. The trustees shall then report their proceedings, duly verified, to the superior court of the county wherein the bank is located, and upon such report and the petition of the trustees, and after notice to the attorney general and the director, and such other notice as the court may deem necessary, the court shall adjudge the franchise surrendered and the existence of the corporation terminated. Certified copies of the judgment shall be filed in the offices of the secretary of state and the director and shall be recorded in the office of the secretary of state.

## 32.24.030 - Transfer of assets and liabilities to another bank.
An unconverted mutual savings bank may for the purpose of consolidation, acquisition, pooling of assets, merger, or voluntary liquidation arrange for its assets and liabilities to become assets and liabilities of another mutual savings bank, by the affirmative vote or with the written consent of two-thirds of the whole number of its trustees, but only with the written consent of the director and upon such terms and conditions as he or she may prescribe.

Upon any such transfer being made, or upon the liquidation of any such mutual savings bank for any cause whatever, or upon its being no longer engaged in the business of a mutual savings bank, the director shall terminate its certificate of authority, which shall not thereafter be revived or renewed. When the certificate of authority of any such corporation has been revoked, it shall forthwith collect and distribute its remaining assets, and when that is done, the director shall certify the fact to the secretary of state, whereupon the corporation shall cease to exist and the secretary of state shall note the fact upon his or her records.

In case of the consolidation with or voluntary liquidation of a mutual savings bank by another mutual savings bank, as herein provided, any sums advanced by its incorporators, or others, to create or maintain its guaranty fund or its expense fund shall not be liabilities of such mutual savings bank unless the mutual savings bank, so assuming its liabilities shall specifically undertake to pay the same, or a stated portion thereof.

1. Whenever it appears to the director that any offense or delinquency referred to in RCW 32.24.040 has resulted in a savings bank being critically undercapitalized with no reasonably foreseeable prospect of recovery, or that it has suspended payment of its obligations, or is insolvent, the director may notify such savings bank to levy an assessment on its stock, if any, or otherwise to make good such impairment or offense or other delinquency within such time and in such manner as the director may specify, or if the director deems necessary, the director may take possession thereof without notice.

2. Upon taking possession of any savings bank, the director shall forthwith proceed to liquidate the business, affairs, and assets thereof and such liquidation shall be had in accordance with the provisions of law governing the liquidation of insolvent banks and savings banks.

Upon the return day of such notice, or such further day as the matter may be continued to, the court shall summarily hear the cause and shall dismiss the same, if it finds that possession was taken by the director in good faith and for cause, but if it finds that no cause existed for taking possession of the savings bank, it shall require the director to restore the savings bank to the possession of its assets and enjoin the director from further interference therewith without cause.
