However, the plan of conversion may provide that any savings accounts with total deposit balances of less than fifty dollars (or any lesser amount) shall not constitute a qualifying deposit.

2. As used in this section, the term "savings account" includes a predecessor or successor account of a given savings account which is held only in the same right and capacity and on the same terms and conditions as the given savings account. However, the plan of conversion may provide for lesser requirements for consideration as a predecessor or successor account.

Each converted savings bank shall, at the time of conversion, establish a liquidation account in an amount equal to the amount of net worth of the converting savings bank as of the latest practicable date prior to conversion. For the purposes of this section, the savings bank shall use the net worth figure no later than that set forth in its latest statement of financial condition contained in the final offering circular. The function of the liquidation account is to establish a priority on liquidation and, except as provided in RCW 32.32.215, the existence of the liquidation account shall not operate to restrict the use or application of any of the net worth accounts of the converted savings bank.

\[ [1981 c 85 § 36](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c85.pdf?cite=1981%20c%2085%20§%2036); \]

No merger, consolidation, purchase of bulk assets with assumption of savings accounts and other liabilities, or similar transaction, in which the converted savings bank is not the survivor, is considered to be a complete liquidation for this purpose. In these transactions, the liquidation account shall be assumed by the surviving institution.

\[ [1981 c 85 § 38](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c85.pdf?cite=1981%20c%2085%20§%2038); \]

## 32.32.200 - Liquidation account—Determination of subaccount balances.

For savings accounts in existence at both dates, separate subaccounts shall be determined on the basis of the qualifying deposits in these savings accounts on these record dates. The initial subaccount balances shall not be increased, and it shall be subject to downward adjustment as provided in RCW 32.32.205.

## 32.32.205 - Reduction of subaccount balance.
If the deposit balance in any savings account of an eligible account holder or supplemental eligible account holder at the close of business on any annual closing date subsequent to the respective record dates is less than the lesser of (1) the deposit balance in the savings account at the close of business on any other annual closing date subsequent to the eligibility record date or (2) the amount of qualifying deposit as of the eligibility record date or the supplemental eligibility record date, the subaccount balance for the savings account shall be adjusted by reducing the subaccount balance in an amount proportionate to the reduction in the deposit balance. In the event of such a downward adjustment, the subaccount balance shall not be subsequently increased, notwithstanding any increase in the deposit balance of the related savings account. If any such savings account is closed, the related subaccount balance shall be reduced to zero.

\[ [1981 c 85 § 40](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c85.pdf?cite=1981%20c%2085%20§%2040); \]

One of the director of financial institutions' certificates of authorization shall be attached to each of the articles of incorporation, and one set of these shall be filed and retained by the director of financial institutions, one set shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and one set shall be transmitted to the bank for its files. Upon the receipt from the corporation of the same fees as are required for filing and recording other incorporation certificates or articles the secretary of state shall record the same; whereupon the conversion of the mutual savings bank shall be deemed complete, the requirements of RCW 32.08.010 relating to the incorporation certificate of an unconverted mutual savings bank shall no longer apply, and the signers of the articles of incorporation and their successors shall be a corporation having the powers and being subject to the duties and obligations prescribed by the laws of this state applicable to converted mutual savings banks, and the time of existence of the corporation shall be perpetual, unless terminated pursuant to law.

In the first instance the directors shall be those named in the articles of incorporation and afterwards, those elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held at least once each year on a day to be specified by the converted savings bank's bylaws but not later than May 15th of each year. If for any cause an election is not held at that time, it may be held at an adjourned meeting or at a subsequent meeting called for that purpose in the manner prescribed by the corporation's bylaws. Each director shall be a resident of a state of the United States. The directors shall meet at least nine times each year and whenever required by the director. A majority of the board of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

2. If the board of directors consists of nine or more members, in lieu of electing the entire number of directors annually, the converted savings bank's articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide that the directors be divided into either two or three classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, the term of office of directors of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders after their election, that of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting after their election, and that of the third class, if any, to expire at the third annual meeting after their election. At each annual meeting after such classification, the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of such meeting shall be elected to hold office until the second succeeding annual meeting, if there are two classes, or until the third succeeding annual meeting, if there are three classes. A classification of directors shall not be effective prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders.

3. Each director, so far as the duty devolves upon him or her, shall diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the corporation and shall not knowingly violate or willingly permit to be violated any provision of law applicable to the corporation.

4. A vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of the director's predecessor in office. A directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.

## 32.32.515 - Guaranty fund.
The guaranty fund of a mutual savings bank converted under this chapter shall become surplus of the converted savings bank, but shall not be available after conversion for purposes other than those purposes for which a guaranty fund may be used by a mutual savings bank under Title 32 RCW. No contribution need be made to the guaranty fund by the converted savings bank after conversion. When any provision of any other chapter of this title refers to the amount of the guaranty fund for the purpose of determining the extent of the authority of a savings bank, and not for purposes of prescribing the use of funds in or contributions to the guaranty fund, such provision shall be deemed to refer to an amount including capital surplus and paid-in capital of a stock savings bank.
