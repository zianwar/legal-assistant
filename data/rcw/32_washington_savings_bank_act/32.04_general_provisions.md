8. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or other applicable law, a savings bank or holding company shall not be in violation of any provision of this section on account of its compliance with required reporting to the federal securities and exchange commission, including the disclosure of any order of the director.

9. Every person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
