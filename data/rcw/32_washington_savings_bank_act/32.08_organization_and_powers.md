   c. A savings bank or holding company may not by agreement or otherwise change the application of (a) of this subsection to the savings bank or holding company.

   a. Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 25.15 RCW or this section to the contrary, all voting members remain liable and responsible as fiduciaries of a savings bank or holding company organized as a limited liability company, regardless of resignation, dissociation, or disqualification, to the same extent that directors of a savings bank or holding company organized as a corporation would be or remain liable or responsible to the department and applicable federal banking regulators; and

   b.

## 32.08.100 - Guaranty fund.

## 32.08.110 - Guaranty fund—Purpose.
The contributions of the incorporators, or trustees of any such savings bank under the provisions of RCW 32.08.100, and the sums credited thereto from its net earnings under the provisions of RCW 32.08.120, shall constitute a guaranty fund for the security of its depositors, and shall be held to meet any contingency or loss in its business from depreciation of its securities or otherwise, and for no other purpose except as provided in RCW 32.08.130, and RCW 32.12.090(5).

## 32.08.115 - Guaranty fund—Payment of interest and dividends—Legislative declaration.
It is hereby recognized that the savings banks of the state of Washington are affected adversely by the uncertainties and ambiguities in the law relating to guaranty funds. It is the express purpose of the legislature in enacting RCW 32.08.116 to clarify that the law permits payment of interest and dividends from the guaranty funds of savings banks and RCW 32.08.116 shall be liberally construed to that end.

\[ [1982 c 5 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982c5.pdf?cite=1982%20c%205%20§%201); \]

## 32.08.116 - Guaranty fund—Payment of interest and dividends—When authorized.
A savings bank not having net earnings or undivided profits or other surplus may pay interest and dividends from its guaranty fund upon prior written approval of the director, which approval shall not be withheld unless the director has determined that such payments would place the savings bank in an unsafe and unsound condition.

\[ [1994 c 92 § 317](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2438-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%2092%20§%20317); [1982 c 5 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982c5.pdf?cite=1982%20c%205%20§%202); \]

## 32.08.120 - Guaranty fund—Replenishment—Dividends.
1. If at the close of any dividend period the guaranty fund of a savings bank is less than ten percent of the amount due to depositors, there shall be deducted from its net earnings and credited to its guaranty fund not less than five percent of its net earnings for such period.

2. The balance of its net earnings for such dividend period, plus any earnings from prior accounting periods not previously disbursed and not reserved for losses or other contingencies or required to be maintained in the guaranty fund, shall be available for dividends.

While the trustees of such savings bank are paying its expenses or any portion thereof, the amounts to be credited to its guaranty fund shall be computed at the same percentage upon the total dividends credited to its depositors instead of upon its net earnings. If the guaranty fund accumulated from earnings equals or exceeds ten percent of the amount due to depositors, the minimum dividend shall be four percent, if the net earnings for such period are sufficient therefor.

\[ [1955 c 13 § 32.08.120](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1955c13.pdf?cite=1955%20c%2013%20§%2032.08.120); [1941 c 15 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1941c15.pdf?cite=1941%20c%2015%20§%204); [1929 c 123 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1929c123.pdf?cite=1929%20c%20123%20§%203); [1927 c 184 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1927c184.pdf?cite=1927%20c%20184%20§%206); [1915 c 175 § 24](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1915c175.pdf?cite=1915%20c%20175%20§%2024); Rem. Supp. 1941 § 3353; \]

## 32.08.130 - Reimbursement fund.
When the portion of the guaranty fund created from earnings amounts to not less than five thousand dollars (including in the case of a savings bank converted from a building and loan or savings and loan association or society the amount of the initial guaranty fund), the board of trustees, with the written consent of the director, may establish a reimbursement fund from which to repay contributors to the expense fund and the initial guaranty fund (excepting the initial guaranty fund in the case of a bank converted from a building and loan or savings and loan association or society), and may transfer to the reimbursement fund any unexpended balance of contributions to the expense fund. At the close of each dividend period the trustees may place to the credit of the reimbursement fund not more than one percent of the net earnings of the bank during that period. Payments from the reimbursement fund may be made from time to time in such amounts as the board of trustees shall determine, and shall be made first to the contributors to the expense fund in proportion to their contributions thereto until they shall have been repaid in full, and then shall be made to the contributors to the guaranty fund in proportion to their contributions thereto until they shall have been repaid in full. In case of the liquidation of the savings bank before the contributions to the expense fund and the initial guaranty fund have been fully repaid as above contemplated, any portion of the contributions not needed for the payment of the expenses of liquidation and the payment of depositors in full shall be paid to the contributors to the expense fund in proportion to their contributions thereto until they have been repaid in full, and then shall be paid to the contributors to the guaranty fund in proportion to their contributions thereto until they have been repaid in full.

5. Before engaging in trust business, a mutual savings bank shall apply to the director on such form as he or she shall determine and pay the same fee as required for a state bank to engage in trust business. In considering such application the director shall ascertain from the best source of information at his or her command and by such investigation as he or she may deem necessary whether the management and personnel of the mutual savings bank are such as to command confidence and warrant belief that the trust business will be adequately and efficiently conducted in accordance with law, whether the resources in the neighborhood of such place and in the surrounding country afford a reasonable promise of adequate support for the proposed trust business and whether the resources of the mutual savings bank are sufficient to support the conduct of such trust business, and that the mutual savings bank has and maintains, in addition to its guaranty fund, undivided profits against which the depositors have no prior claim in an amount not less than would be required of a state bank or trust company, which undivided profits shall be eligible for investment in the same manner as the guaranty fund of a mutual savings bank. Within sixty days after receipt of such application, the director shall either approve or refuse the same and forthwith return to the mutual savings bank a copy of the application upon which his or her decision has been endorsed. The director shall not be required to approve or refuse an application until thirty days after any appropriate approval has been obtained from a federal regulatory agency.

## 32.08.220 - Findings—Purpose.
The legislature finds that [the] state of Washington needs investment of funds from out of state and from investors in the state of Washington to keep money for real estate and other forms of financing reasonably available for the needs of Washington citizens. Many innovations have taken place in the last several years to aid in the sale of loans or portions thereof to others including the sale of mortgage pass-through certificates, mortgage backed bonds, participation sales with varying rates, terms or priorities to various participants and the like. As the marketing of such investments continues, further innovations can be expected. It will benefit the state if mutual savings banks subject to the laws of this state have the broadest powers possible commensurate with their safety and soundness to take part in such activities. It is the purpose of RCW 32.08.225 and 32.08.230 to grant a broad power.
