2. The bonds, notes, mortgages, or other interest bearing obligations purchased or acquired by a savings bank, shall not be entered on its books at more than the actual cost thereof, and shall not thereafter be carried upon its books for a longer period than until the next declaration of dividends, or in any event for more than one year, at a valuation exceeding their present cost as determined by amortization, that is, by deducting from the cost of any such security purchased for a sum in excess of the amount payable thereon at maturity and charging to "profit and loss" a sufficient sum to bring it to par at maturity, or adding to the cost of any such security purchased at less than the amount payable thereon at maturity and crediting to "profit and loss" a sufficient sum to bring it to par at maturity.

An appraisal shall be made by a qualified person of every such parcel of real estate within six months from the date of conveyance.

   a. All earnings actually received during such period, less interest accrued and uncollected included in the last previous calculation of earnings;

## 32.12.090 - Interest—Rate—Notice of changed rate.
1. Every savings bank shall regulate the rate of interest upon the amounts to the credit of depositors therewith, in such manner that depositors shall receive as nearly as may be all the earnings of the bank after transferring the amount required by RCW 32.08.120 and such further amounts as its trustees may deem it expedient and for the security of the depositors to transfer to the guaranty fund, which to the amount of ten percent of the amount due its depositors the trustees shall gradually accumulate and hold. Such trustees may also deduct from its net earnings, and carry as reserves for losses, or other contingencies, or as undivided profits, such additional sums as they may deem wise.

2. Every savings bank may classify its depositors according to the local market, character, amount, regularity, or duration of their dealings with the savings bank, and may regulate the interest in such manner that each depositor shall receive the same ratable portion of interest as all others of his or her class.

3. Unimpaired contributions to the initial guaranty fund and to the expense fund, made by the incorporators or trustees of a savings bank, shall be entitled to have dividends apportioned thereon, which may be credited and paid to such incorporators or trustees.

Whenever the guaranty fund of any savings bank is sufficiently large to permit the return of such contributions, the contributors may receive interest thereon not theretofore credited or paid at the same rate paid to depositors.

4. A savings bank may pay interest on deposits at such rates as its board or a committee or officer designated by the board shall from time to time determine.

5. The trustees of any savings banks, other than a stock savings bank, whose undivided profits and guaranty fund, determined in the manner prescribed in RCW 32.12.070, amount to more than twenty-five percent of the amount due its depositors, shall at least once in three years divide equitably the accumulation beyond such twenty-five percent as an extra dividend to depositors in excess of the regular dividend authorized.

6. A notice posted conspicuously in a savings bank of a change in the rate of interest shall be equivalent to a personal notice.
