   a. Has violated the terms of its certificate of authority or any laws applicable thereto;

   b. Is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner;

   c. Is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact its business;

   d. Has an impairment of its capital;

   e. Has become otherwise insolvent;

   f. Has neglected or refused to comply with the terms of a duly issued lawful order of the director;

   g. Has refused, upon proper demand, to submit its records, affairs, and concerns for inspection and examination of a duly appointed or authorized examiner of the director;

   h. Through its officers, has refused to be examined upon oath regarding its affairs; or

   i. Has made a voluntary assignment of its assets to trustees.

2. Notwithstanding the notice requirement in subsection (1) of this section, the director may without notice seize and take immediate possession of a state trust company if it appears to the director that the conditions of the state trust company are so hazardous that they pose an imminent threat to the general public or the interests of the state trust company's clients.

\[ [2014 c 37 § 382](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6135.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%2037%20§%20382); \]

## 30B.44B.010 - Mutual consent to dissolution and liquidation.
If the director consents, any state trust company may voluntarily place its assets and business under the control of the director for liquidation by a resolution of a majority of its directors or members upon notice to the director. Upon taking possession of the state trust company, the director, or duly appointed agent, shall retain possession thereof until the state trust company is authorized by the director to resume business or until the affairs of the state trust company are fully liquidated as provided in this chapter. A state trust company shall not make any general assignment for the benefit of its creditors except by surrendering possession of its assets to the director, as provided in this section. Whenever any state trust company for any reason suspends operations for any length of time, the state trust company shall, immediately upon such suspension of operations, be deemed in the possession of the director and subject to liquidation under this chapter.

\[ [2014 c 37 § 383](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6135.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%2037%20§%20383); \]

The taking of possession of any state trust company by the director pursuant to RCW 30B.44B.005 or 30B.44B.010 is sufficient to place all of the state trust company's fiduciary assets in the custody of the director and all of the nonfiduciary assets and property of every nature in the director's possession and bar all attachment proceedings.

\[ [2019 c 389 § 64](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5107.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20389%20§%2064); \]

## 30B.44B.040 - Director's right to take possession may be contested.
1. Within ten days after the director takes possession of a state trust company pursuant to RCW 30B.44B.005, the state trust company may serve a notice upon the director to appear before the superior court of the county where the headquarters of the state trust company is located and at a time to be fixed by the court, which shall not be less than five nor more than fifteen days from the date of the service of such notice, to show cause why the director's action taking possession of the state trust company should not be affirmed.

2. Upon the return day of such notice, or such further day as the matter may be continued to, the court shall summarily hear the show-cause petition and shall dismiss it, if the court finds that possession of the state trust company was taken by the director in good faith and for cause. If, however, the court finds that no cause existed for taking possession of the state trust company, the court shall require the director to restore the state trust company to possession of its assets and enjoin the director from further interference with the state trust company without cause.

\[ [2019 c 389 § 65](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5107.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20389%20§%2065); \]

   b. Furnish written notice:

      i. To all persons having possession of any assets of the state trust company; and

      ii.

2. No person knowing of the taking of such possession by the director shall have a lien or charge for any payment advanced or cleared or liability incurred against any of the assets of the state trust company or any trust assets under management.

3. With the approval of the superior court of the county in which the headquarters of the state trust company was located, the director may sell, compound, or compromise bad or doubtful debts, and upon such terms as the court shall direct, the director may borrow, mortgage, pledge, or sell all or any part of the real estate and personal property of the state trust company. The director shall deliver to each purchaser or lender an appropriate deed, mortgage, agreement of pledge, or other instrument of title or security.

4. The director may appoint special assistants and other necessary agents to assist in the administration and liquidation of the state trust company, a certificate of such appointment to be filed with the clerk of the county where the headquarters of the state trust company was located.

5. Except for a special assistant who is an employee of the department, the director shall require such special assistant or agent to give a surety company bond, conditioned as the director shall provide, the premium of which shall be paid out of the assets of the state trust company.

6. The director may also request legal assistance from the Washington attorney general in such administration and liquidation; provided, however, that with permission of the Washington attorney general, the director may employ an attorney in private practice to perform such delegated functions.

\[ [2019 c 389 § 66](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5107.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20389%20§%2066); \]

1. The director shall publish on the department's public website and also once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation, which the director shall select, a notice requiring all persons having claims against the dissolved state trust company to make proof of claim to the department as specified in the notice not later than ninety days from the date of the first publication of such notice.

2. The director shall mail similar notices to all persons whose names appeared as creditors upon the books of the state trust company as of the date and time of the director taking possession pursuant to RCW 30B.44B.005 or 30B.44B.010.

3. The director may approve or reject any claims, but shall serve notice of rejection upon the claimant by mail or personally. A declaration of service of such notice, signed under penalty of perjury, shall be deemed a rebuttable presumption that notice has been given pursuant to this section.

4. No action shall be brought on any claim after ninety days from the date of service of notice of rejection.

5. After the expiration of the time fixed in the notice, the director shall have no power to accept any claim.

## 30B.44B.100 - Temporary receiver—Prohibited except in emergency.
1. A receiver shall not be appointed by any court for any state trust company, nor shall any assignment of any state trust company for the benefit of creditors be valid, except that, in addition to the director's authority to take possession of a state trust company pursuant to RCW 30B.44B.005 or 30B.44B.010, the superior court otherwise having jurisdiction may in case of imminent necessity appoint a temporary receiver to take possession of and preserve the assets of such state trust company.

   a. Sufficient remedy has been made of the state trust company's impairment and delinquencies; and

   b. It is in the best interest of trustors, beneficiaries, creditors, shareholders, and the general public that the state trust company be reopened rather than be liquidated.
