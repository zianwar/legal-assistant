## 66.40.020 - Election may be held.
Within any unit referred to in RCW 66.40.010, upon compliance with the conditions hereinafter prescribed, there may be held, at the time and as a part of any general election, an election upon the question of whether the sale of liquor shall be permitted within such unit; and in the event that any such election is held in any such unit, no other election under this section shall be held prior to the next succeeding general election.

Whenever a majority of qualified voters voting upon the question in the election unit vote "against the sale of liquor under spirits, beer, and wine restaurant; spirits, beer, and wine private club; spirits, beer, and wine nightclub; and sports entertainment facility licenses," the county auditor must file with the *liquor control board a certificate showing the result of the canvass at the election.

Furthermore, the new territory is not: (a) Within the election unit in any subsequent election under subsection (1) of this section; or (b) subject to any prohibition adopted pursuant to any subsequent election under subsection (1) of this section.

3. Elections held under RCW 66.40.010, 66.40.020, 66.40.040, 66.40.100, 66.40.110, 66.40.120, and 66.40.140 are limited to the question of whether the sale of liquor by means other than under spirits, beer, and wine restaurant; spirits, beer, and wine private club; spirits, beer, and wine nightclub; and sports entertainment facility licenses is permitted within the election unit.
