   a. The commercial setting of the negotiations;

   b. Whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the other party reasonably to protect his or her interests by reason of physical or mental infirmity, illiteracy, inability to understand the language of the agreement, or similar factors;

   c. The effect and purpose of the contract or clause; and

   d. If a sale, any gross disparity at the time of contracting between the amount charged for the property and the value of that property measured by the price at which similar property was readily obtainable in similar transactions.

3. If the index is revised after December 1979, the percentage of change pursuant to this section must be calculated on the basis of the revised index. If the revision of the index changes the reference base index, a revised reference base index must be determined by multiplying the reference base index then applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the bureau of labor statistics. If the index is superseded, the index referred to in this section is the one represented by the bureau of labor statistics as reflecting most accurately the changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for consumers.

## 64.90.230 - Leasehold common interest communities.
1. Any lease the expiration or termination of which may terminate the common interest community or reduce its size, or a memorandum of the lease, must be recorded. Every lessor of these leases in a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community must sign the declaration. The declaration must state:

   a. The recording number of the lease or a statement of where the complete lease may be inspected;

   b. The date on which the lease is scheduled to expire;

   c. A legal description of the real estate subject to the lease;

   d. Any right of the unit owners to redeem the reversion and the manner in which those rights may be exercised, or a statement that they do not have those rights;

2. The declaration may provide for the collection by the association of the proportionate rents paid on the lease by the unit owners and may designate the association as the representative of the unit owners on all matters relating to the lease.

3. After the declaration for a condominium, miscellaneous community, or plat community is recorded, neither the lessor nor the lessor's successor in interest may terminate the leasehold interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of a unit owner's share of the rent and otherwise complies with all covenants that, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate the lease. A unit owner's leasehold interest in a condominium, miscellaneous community, or plat community is not affected by failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill any other covenant.

4. Acquisition of the leasehold interest of any unit owner by the owner of the reversion or remainder does not merge the leasehold and fee simple interests unless the leasehold interests of all unit owners subject to that reversion or remainder are acquired and the owner of the reversion or remainder records a document confirming the merger.

5. If the expiration or termination of a lease decreases the number of units in a common interest community, the allocated interests must be reallocated in accordance with RCW 64.90.030(1) as though those units had been taken by condemnation. Reallocations must be confirmed by an amendment to the declaration and map prepared, executed, and recorded by the association.

   b. In a cooperative, an ownership interest in the association, a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the association, and a portion of the votes in the association; and

   c. In a plat community and miscellaneous community, a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the association and a portion of the votes in the association.

2. The declaration must state the formulas used to establish allocations of interests. Those allocations may not discriminate in favor of units owned by the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant.

3. If units may be added to or withdrawn from the common interest community, the declaration must state the formulas to be used to reallocate the allocated interests among all units included in the common interest community after the addition or withdrawal.

4. [Empty]

   a. The declaration may provide:

      i. That different allocations of votes are made to the units on particular matters specified in the declaration;

      ii. For cumulative voting only for the purpose of electing board members; and

      iii. For class voting on specified issues affecting the class if necessary to protect valid interests of the class.

   b. A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading any limitation imposed on declarants under this chapter, and units do not constitute a class because they are owned by a declarant.

5. Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense liabilities and, in a condominium, the sum of the undivided interests in the common elements allocated at any time to all the units must each equal one if stated as a fraction or one hundred percent if stated as a percentage. In the event of discrepancy between an allocated interest and the result derived from application of the pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.

6. [Empty]

   a. In a condominium, the common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which that interest is allocated is void.

   b. In a cooperative, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an ownership interest in the association made without the possessory interest in the unit to which that interest is related is void.

   a. Except in the case of a reallocation being made by a declarant pursuant to a development right reserved in the declaration, a limited common element may be reallocated between units only with the approval of the board and by an amendment to the declaration executed by the unit owners between or among whose units the reallocation is made.

   b. The board must approve the request of the unit owner or owners under this subsection (2) within thirty days, or within such other period provided by the declaration, unless the proposed reallocation does not comply with this chapter or the declaration. The failure of the board to act upon a request within such period is deemed an approval of the request.

   c. The amendment must be executed and recorded by the association and be recorded in the name of the common interest community.

3. Unless provided otherwise in the declaration, the unit owners of units to which at least sixty-seven percent of the votes are allocated, including the unit owner of the unit to which the common element or limited common element will be assigned or incorporated, must agree to reallocate a common element as a limited common element or to incorporate a common element or a limited common element into an existing unit. Such reallocation or incorporation must be reflected in an amendment to the declaration and the map.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 209](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20209); \]

The amendment to the declaration must assign an identifying number to each new unit created and, except in the case of subdivision, combination, or conversion of units described in subsection (3) of this section, reallocate the allocated interests among all units. The amendment must describe any common elements and any limited common elements created and, in the case of limited common elements, designate the unit to which each is allocated to the extent required under RCW 64.90.240. The amendments are effective upon recording.

2. Development rights may be reserved within any real estate added to the common interest community if the amendment to the declaration adding that real estate includes all matters required under RCW 64.90.225 and 64.90.230 and the amendment to the map includes all matters required under RCW 64.90.245. This subsection does not extend the time limit on the exercise of development rights imposed by the declaration pursuant to RCW 64.90.225(1)(h).

3. When a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide, combine, or convert a unit previously created into additional units or common elements, or both:

   a. If the declarant converts the unit entirely into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of that unit among the other units as if that unit had been taken by condemnation under RCW 64.90.030; or

   b. If the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the unit among the units created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.

4. If the declaration provides, pursuant to RCW 64.90.225(1)(h), that all or a portion of the real estate is subject to a right of withdrawal:

   a. If all the real estate is subject to withdrawal, and the declaration or map or amendment to the declaration or map does not describe separate portions of real estate subject to that right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn if a unit in that real estate has been conveyed to a purchaser; or

   b. If any portion of the real estate is subject to withdrawal as described in the declaration or map or amendment to the declaration or map, none of that portion of the real estate may be withdrawn if a unit in that portion has been conveyed to a purchaser.

5. If the declarant combines two or more units into a lesser number of units, whether or not any part of a unit is converted into common elements or common elements are converted units, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all of the allocated interests of the units being combined into the unit or units created by the combination in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.

6. A unit conveyed to a purchaser may not be withdrawn pursuant to subsection (4)(a) or (b) of this section without the consent of the unit owner of that unit and the holder of a security interest in the unit.

## 64.90.255 - Common elements and units—Alterations.
Subject to the provisions of the governing documents and other provisions of law, a unit owner:

1. May make any improvements or alterations to the unit owner's unit that do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical or electrical systems or lessen the support of any portion of the common interest community;

2. May not change the appearance of the common elements without approval of the board;

3. After acquiring an adjoining unit or an adjoining part of an adjoining unit, with approval of the board, may remove or alter any intervening partition or create apertures in the unit or adjoining unit, even if the partition in whole or in part is a common element. The removal of partitions or creation of apertures under this subsection is not an alteration of boundaries. The board must approve a unit owner's request, which must include the plans and specifications for the proposed removal or alteration, under this subsection (3) after receipt of all required information unless the proposed alteration does not comply with this section or the governing documents; and

4. May eliminate the title to a mobile home or manufactured home within the unit as permitted under chapter 65.20 RCW without the consent or joinder by the association, any other unit owner, or any party having a security interest in any other unit or the common elements.

1. Subject to the provisions of the declaration, RCW 64.90.255, and other provisions of law, the boundaries between adjoining units may be relocated upon application to the board by the unit owners of those units and upon approval by the board pursuant to this section. The application must include plans showing the relocated boundaries and such other information as the board may require. If the unit owners of the adjoining units have specified a reallocation between their units of their allocated interests, the application must state the proposed reallocations. Unless the board determines, after receipt of all required information, that the reallocations are unreasonable or that the proposed boundary relocation does not comply with the declaration, RCW 64.90.255, or other provisions of law, the board must approve the application and prepare any amendments to the declaration and map in accordance with the requirements of subsection (3) of this section.

2. [Empty]

   a. Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, boundaries between units and common elements may be relocated to incorporate common elements within a unit by an amendment to the declaration upon application to the association by the unit owner of the unit who proposes to relocate a boundary. The amendment may be approved only if the unit owner of the unit, the boundary of which is being relocated, and, unless the declaration provides otherwise, persons entitled to cast at least sixty-seven percent of the votes in the association, including sixty-seven percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree.

   b. The association may require payment to the association of a one-time fee or charge or continuing fees or charges payable by the unit owners of the units whose boundaries are being relocated to include common elements.

3. [Empty]

   a. The association must prepare any amendment to the declaration in accordance with the requirements of RCW 64.90.225 and any amendment to the map in accordance with the requirements of RCW 64.90.245 necessary to show or describe the altered boundaries of affected units and their dimensions and identifying numbers.

   b.

The amendments are effective upon recording.

4. All costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the association for preparing and recording amendments to the declaration and map under this section must be assessed to the unit, the boundaries of which are being relocated.

## 64.90.265 - Subdivision and combination of units.
1. Unless prohibited in the declaration, subject to the provisions of the declaration, RCW 64.90.255, and other provisions of law, a unit may be subdivided into two or more units upon application to the association by the unit owner of the unit and upon approval by the board pursuant to this section. The application must include plans showing the relocated boundaries, a reallocation of all the allocated interests of the units among the units created by the subdivision, and such other information as the board may require. Unless the board determines, after receipt of all required information, that the reallocations are unreasonable or that the proposed boundary relocation does not comply with the declaration, RCW 64.90.240 and 64.90.255, or other provisions of law, the board must approve the application and prepare any amendments to the declaration and map in accordance with the requirements of subsection (4) of this section.

2. Unless prohibited in the declaration, subject to the provisions of the declaration, RCW 64.90.255, and other provisions of law, two or more units may be combined into a lesser number of units upon application to the association by the owners of those units and upon approval by the board pursuant to this section. The application must include plans showing the relocated boundaries, a reallocation of all the allocated interests of the units being combined among the units resulting from the combination, and such other information as the board may require. Unless the board determines, after receipt of all required information, that the reallocations are unreasonable or that the proposed boundary relocation does not comply with the declaration, RCW 64.90.240 and 64.90.255, or other provisions of law, the board shall approve the application and prepare any amendments to the declaration and map in accordance with the requirements of subsection (4) of this section.

3. The association may require payment to the association of a one-time fee or charge or continuing fees or charges payable by the owners of the units whose boundaries are being relocated to include common elements.

The association must prepare, execute, and record any amendments to the declaration and, in a condominium, cooperative, or miscellaneous community, the map, prepared in accordance with the requirements of RCW 64.90.245 and 64.90.285(3), subdividing or combining those units. The amendment to the declaration must be executed by the association and unit owner or owners of the units from which the subdivided or combined unit or units are derived, assign an identifying number to each resulting unit, and reallocate the allocated interests formerly allocated to the unit from which a combination was derived to the new unit or, if two or more units are derived from such combination, among the new units in any reasonable manner prescribed by such owners in the amendment or on any other basis the declaration requires. The amendments are effective upon recording.

5. All costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the association for preparing and recording amendments to the declaration and map under this section must be assessed to the unit, the boundaries of which are being relocated.

## 64.90.270 - Monuments as boundaries.
1. The physical boundaries of a unit located in a building containing or comprising that unit constructed or reconstructed in substantial accordance with the map, or amendment to the map, are its boundaries rather than any boundaries shown on the map, regardless of settling or lateral movement of the unit or of any building containing or comprising the unit, or of any minor variance between boundaries of the unit or any building containing or comprising the unit shown on the map.

2. This section does not relieve a unit owner from liability in case of the unit owner's willful misconduct or relieve a declarant or any other person from liability for failure to adhere to the map.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 215](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20215); \]

## 64.90.275 - Sales purposes.
1. A declarant may maintain sales offices, management offices, and models in units or on common elements in the common interest community only if the declaration so provides. In a cooperative or condominium, any sales office, management office, or model not designated a unit by the declaration is a common element.

2. When a declarant no longer owns a unit or has the right to create a unit in the common interest community, the declarant ceases to have any rights under this section unless the unit is removed promptly from the common interest community in accordance with a right to remove reserved in the declaration.

3. Subject to any limitations in the declaration, a declarant may maintain signs in or on units owned by the declarant or the common elements advertising the common interest community.

4. This section is subject to the provisions of other state law and local ordinances.

3. Subject to the declaration and rules, the unit owners have a right to use the common elements that are not limited common elements for the purposes for which the common elements were intended.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 217](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20217); \]

## 64.90.285 - Amendment of declaration.
1. [Empty]

   a. Except in cases of amendments that may be executed by: A declarant under subsection (10) of this section, RCW 64.90.240(2), 64.90.245(12), 64.90.250, or 64.90.415(2)(d); the association under RCW 64.90.030, 64.90.230(5), 64.90.240(3), 64.90.260(1), or 64.90.265 or subsection (11) of this section; or certain unit owners under RCW 64.90.240(2), 64.90.260(1), 64.90.265(2), or 64.90.290(2), and except as limited by subsections (4), (6), (7), (8), and (12) of this section, the declaration may be amended only by vote or agreement of unit owners of units to which at least sixty-seven percent of the votes in the association are allocated, unless the declaration specifies a different percentage not to exceed ninety percent for all amendments or for specific subjects of amendment. For purposes of this section, "amendment" means any change to the declaration, including adding, removing, or modifying restrictions contained in a declaration.

   b. If the declaration requires the approval of another person as a condition of its effectiveness, the amendment is not valid without that approval; however, any right of approval may not result in an expansion of special declarant rights reserved in the declaration or violate any other section of this chapter, including RCW 64.90.015, 64.90.050, 64.90.055, and 64.90.060.

2. In the absence of fraud, any action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the association may not be brought more than one year after the amendment is recorded.

3. Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in every county in which any portion of the common interest community is located and is effective only upon recordation. An amendment, except an amendment pursuant to RCW 64.90.260(1), must be indexed in the grantee's index in the name of the common interest community and the association and in the grantor's index in the name of the parties executing the amendment.

4. Except to the extent expressly permitted or required under this chapter, an amendment may not create or increase special declarant rights, increase the number of units, change the boundaries of any unit, or change the allocated interests of a unit without the consent of unit owners to which at least ninety percent of the votes in the association are allocated, including the consent of any unit owner of a unit, the boundaries of which or allocated interest of which is changed by the amendment.

5. Amendments to the declaration required to be executed by the association must be executed by any authorized officer of the association who must certify in the amendment that it was properly adopted.

6. The declaration may require a higher percentage of unit owner approval for an amendment that is intended to prohibit or materially restrict the uses of units permitted under the applicable zoning ordinances, or to protect the interests of members of a defined class of owners, or to protect other legitimate interests of the association or its members. Subject to subsection (13) of this section, a declaration may not require, as a condition for amendment, approval by more than ninety percent of the votes in the association or by all but one unit owner, whichever is less. An amendment approved under this subsection must provide reasonable protection for a use permitted at the time the amendment was adopted.

7. The time limits specified in the declaration pursuant to RCW 64.90.225(1)(g) within which reserved development rights must be exercised may be extended, and additional development rights may be created, if persons entitled to cast at least eighty percent of the votes in the association, including eighty percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree to that action. The agreement is effective thirty days after an amendment to the declaration reflecting the terms of the agreement is recorded unless all the persons holding the affected special declarant rights, or security interests in those rights, record a written objection within the thirty-day period, in which case the amendment is void, or consent in writing at the time the amendment is recorded, in which case the amendment is effective when recorded.

8. A provision in the declaration creating special declarant rights that have not expired may not be amended without the consent of the declarant.

9. If any provision of this chapter or the declaration requires the consent of a holder of a security interest in a unit as a condition to the effectiveness of an amendment to the declaration, the consent is deemed granted if a refusal to consent in a record is not received by the association within sixty days after the association delivers notice of the proposed amendment to the holder at an address for notice provided by the holder or mails the notice to the holder by certified mail, return receipt requested, at that address. If the holder has not provided an address for notice to the association, the association must provide notice to the address in the security interest of record.

10. Upon thirty-day advance notice to unit owners, the declarant may, without a vote of the unit owners or approval by the board, unilaterally adopt, execute, and record a corrective amendment or supplement to the governing documents to correct a mathematical mistake, an inconsistency, or a scrivener's error, or clarify an ambiguity in the governing documents with respect to an objectively verifiable fact including, without limitation, recalculating the undivided interest in the common elements, the liability for common expenses, or the number of votes in the unit owners' association appertaining to a unit, within five years after the recordation or adoption of the governing document containing or creating the mistake, inconsistency, error, or ambiguity. Any such amendment or supplement may not materially reduce what the obligations of the declarant would have been if the mistake, inconsistency, error, or ambiguity had not occurred.

11. Upon thirty-day advance notice to unit owners, the association may, upon a vote of two-thirds of the members of the board, without a vote of the unit owners, adopt, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration for the following purposes:

    a. To correct or supplement the governing documents as provided in subsection (10) of this section;

    b. To remove language and otherwise amend as necessary to effect the removal of language purporting to forbid or restrict the conveyance, encumbrance, occupancy, or lease to: Individuals of a specified race, creed, color, sex, or national origin; individuals with sensory, mental, or physical disabilities; and families with children or any other legally protected classification;

    c. To remove language and otherwise amend as necessary to effect the removal of language that purports to impose limitations on the power of the association beyond the limit authorized in RCW 64.90.405(3)(a) to deal with the declarant that are more restrictive than the limitations imposed on the power of the association to deal with other persons; and

    d. To remove any other language and otherwise amend as necessary to effect the removal of language purporting to limit the rights of the association or its unit owners in direct conflict with this chapter.

12. If the declaration requires that amendments to the declaration may be adopted only if the amendment is signed by a specified number or percentage of unit owners and if the common interest community contains more than twenty units, such requirement is deemed satisfied if the association obtains such signatures or the vote or agreement of unit owners holding such number or percentage.

13. [Empty]

    a. If the declaration requires that amendments to the declaration may be adopted only by the vote or agreement of unit owners of units to which more than sixty-seven percent of the votes in the association are allocated, and the percentage required is otherwise consistent with this chapter, the amendment is approved if:

       i. The approval of the percentage specified in the declaration is obtained;

       ii. [Empty]

           A.  Unit owners of units to which at least sixty-seven percent of the votes in the association are allocated vote for or agree to the proposed amendment;

           B.  A unit owner does not vote against the proposed amendment; and

           C.  Notice of the proposed amendment, including notice that the failure of a unit owner to object may result in the adoption of the amendment, is delivered to the unit owners holding the votes in the association that have not voted or agreed to the proposed amendment and no written objection to the proposed amendment is received by the association within sixty days after the association delivers notice; or

       iii. [Empty]

            A.  Unit owners of units to which at least sixty-seven percent of the votes in the association are allocated vote for or agree to the proposed amendment;

            B.  At least one unit owner objects to the proposed amendment; and

            C.  Pursuant to an action brought by the association in the county in which the common interest community is situated against all objecting unit owners, the court finds, under the totality of circumstances including, but not limited to, the subject matter of the amendment, the purpose of the amendment, the percentage voting to approve the amendment, and the percentage objecting to the amendment, that the amendment is reasonable.

    b. If the declaration requires the affirmative vote or approval of any particular unit owner or class of unit owners as a condition of its effectiveness, the amendment is not valid without that vote or approval.

## 64.90.290 - Termination.
1. Except for a taking of all the units by condemnation, foreclosure against an entire cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the declaration, or in the circumstances described in RCW 64.90.325, a common interest community may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least eighty percent of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, and with any other approvals required by the declaration. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

2. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement, or ratifications of the agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement is void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications of the agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is situated and is effective only upon recordation. An agreement to terminate may only be amended by complying with the requirements of this subsection and subsection (1) of this section.

3. [Empty]

   a. In the case of a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community containing only units having horizontal boundaries between units, a termination agreement may provide that all of the common elements and units of the common interest community must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the common interest community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the minimum purchase price, manner of payment, and outside closing date, and may include any other terms of the sale.

   b. In the case of a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community containing no units having horizontal boundaries between units, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements that are not necessary for the habitability of a unit, but it may not require that any unit be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all the unit owners consent to the sale. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the common interest community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the minimum purchase price, manner of payment, and outside closing date, and may include any other terms of sale.

   c. In the case of a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community containing some units having horizontal boundaries between units and some units without horizontal boundaries between units, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements that are not necessary for the habitability of a unit, but it may not require that any unit be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all the unit owners of units in the building to be sold consent to the sale. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the common interest community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the minimum purchase price, manner of payment, and outside closing date, and may include any other terms of sale.

4. [Empty]

   a. The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in a common interest community, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. If any real estate is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds of the sale distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination.

   b. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections (6) and (8) of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners under this chapter or the declaration.

5. In a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community, if any portion of the real estate constituting the common interest community is not to be sold following termination, title to those portions of the real estate constituting the common elements and, in a common interest community containing units having horizontal boundaries between units described in the declaration, title to all the real estate containing such boundaries in the common interest community vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (8) of this section, and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.

6. [Empty]

   a. Following termination of the common interest community, the proceeds of a sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.

   b. Following termination of a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community, creditors of the association holding liens on the units that were recorded or perfected under RCW 4.64.020 before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder.

   c. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.

7. In a cooperative, the declaration may provide that all creditors of the association have priority over any interests of unit owners and creditors of unit owners. In that event, following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative that were recorded or perfected under RCW 4.64.020 before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lienholder, and any other creditor of the association is to be treated as if the creditor had perfected a lien against the cooperative immediately before termination. Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have that priority:

   a. The lien of each creditor of the association that was perfected against the association before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against each unit owner's interest in the unit as of the date the lien was perfected;

   b. Any other creditor of the association must be treated, upon termination, as if the creditor had perfected a lien against each unit owner's interest immediately before termination;

   c. The amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in (a) and (b) of this subsection against each of the unit owners' interest must be proportionate to the ratio that each unit's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the units;

   d. The lien of each creditor of each unit owner that was perfected before termination continues as a lien against that unit owner's unit as of the date the lien was perfected;

   e. The assets of the association must be distributed to all unit owners and all lienholders as their interests may appear in the order described in this subsection; and

   f. Creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any unit owner in excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that unit owner's interest.

8. The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (4), (5), (6), and (7) of this section are as follows:

   a. Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection, the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, allocated interests, and any limited common elements immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers must be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty days after distribution by unit owners of units to which twenty-five percent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market values of all the units and their allocated interests.

   b. If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value of the unit or limited common element before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are:

      i. In a condominium, their respective common element interests immediately before the termination;

      ii. In a cooperative, their respective ownership interests immediately before the termination; and

      iii. In a plat community or miscellaneous community, their respective common expense liabilities immediately before the termination.

9. In a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community, except as otherwise provided in subsection (10) of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire common interest community does not terminate the common interest community, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the common interest community, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the common interest community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate, or against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by the association under RCW 64.90.465, does not withdraw that real estate from the common interest community, but the person taking title to the real estate may require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the common interest community.

10. In a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community, if a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the common interest community has priority over the declaration and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance, upon foreclosure, may record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the common interest community.

11. The right of partition under chapter 7.52 RCW is suspended if an agreement to sell property is provided for in the termination agreement pursuant to subsection (3)(a), (b), or (c) of this section. The suspension of the right to partition continues unless a binding obligation to sell does not exist three months after the recording of the termination agreement, the binding sale agreement is terminated, or one year after the termination agreement is recorded, whichever occurs first.

## 64.90.295 - Rights of secured lenders.
1. The declaration may require that all or a specified number or percentage of the lenders who hold security interests encumbering the units or who have extended credit to the association approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to the effectiveness of those actions, but no requirement for approval may operate to:

   a. Deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs of the association by the unit owners or the board;

   b. Prevent the association or the board from commencing, intervening in, or settling any litigation or proceeding; or

   c. Prevent any insurance trustee or the association from receiving and distributing any insurance proceeds except pursuant to RCW 64.90.470.

2. With respect to any action requiring the consent of a specified number or percentage of mortgagees, the consent of only eligible mortgagees holding a first lien security interest need be obtained and the percentage must be based upon the votes attributable to units with respect to which eligible mortgagees have an interest.

3. A lender who has extended credit to an association secured by an assignment of income or an encumbrance on the common elements may enforce its security agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to the requirements of this chapter and other law. A requirement that the association must deposit its periodic common charges before default with the lender to which the association's income has been assigned, or increase its common charges at the lender's direction by amounts reasonably necessary to amortize the loan in accordance with its terms, does not violate the prohibitions on lender approval contained in subsection (1) of this section.

## 64.90.300 - Master association.
1. If the declaration provides that any of the powers described in RCW 64.90.405 are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a for-profit or nonprofit corporation or limited liability company that exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more common interest communities or for the benefit of the unit owners of one or more common interest communities, all provisions of this chapter applicable to unit owners associations apply to any such corporation or limited liability company, except as modified by this section.

2. Unless it is acting in the capacity of an association described in RCW 64.90.400, a master association may exercise the powers set forth in RCW 64.90.405(1)(b) only to the extent expressly permitted in the declarations of common interest communities that are part of the master association or expressly described in the delegations of power from those common interest communities to the master association.

3. If the declaration of any common interest community provides that the board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the board is not liable for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following delegation.

4. The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in RCW 64.90.410, 64.90.445, 64.90.450, 64.90.455, 64.90.465, and 64.90.505 apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association only to persons who elect the board of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this chapter.

5. If a master association is also an association described in RCW 64.90.400, the organizational documents of the master association and the declaration of each common interest community, the powers of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the master association, may provide that the board of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways:

   a. All unit owners of all common interest communities subject to the master association may elect all members of the master association's board;

   b. All board members of all common interest communities subject to the master association may elect all members of the master association's board;

   c. All unit owners of each common interest community subject to the master association may elect specified members of the master association's board; or

   d. All board members of each common interest community subject to the master association may elect specified members of the master association's board.

## 64.90.305 - Delegation of power to subassociations.
1. [Empty]

   a. If the declaration provides that any of the powers described in RCW 64.90.405 are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a for-profit corporation or limited liability company that exercises those or other powers on behalf of unit owners owning less than all of the units in a common interest community, and if those unit owners share the exclusive use of one or more limited common elements within the common interest community or share some property or other interest in the common interest community in common that is not shared by the remainder of the unit owners in the common interest community, all provisions of this chapter applicable to unit owners associations apply to any such corporation or limited liability company, except as modified under this section.

   b. The delegation of powers to a subassociation must not be used to discriminate in favor of units owned by the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant.

2. A subassociation may exercise the powers set forth in RCW 64.90.405 only to the extent expressly permitted by the declaration of the common interest community of which the units in the subassociation are a part of or expressly described in the delegations of power from that common interest community to the subassociation.

3. If the declaration of any common interest community contains a delegation of certain powers to a subassociation, or provides that the board of the common interest community may make such a delegation, the board members are not liable for the acts or omissions of the subassociation with respect to those powers so exercised by the subassociation following delegation.

4. The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners association set forth in RCW 64.90.400 through 64.90.500 apply to the conduct of the affairs of a subassociation.

5. Notwithstanding RCW 64.90.415(4), the board of the subassociation must be elected after any period of declarant control by the unit owners of all of the units in the common interest community subject to the subassociation.

6. The declaration of the common interest community creating the subassociation may provide that the authority of the board of the subassociation is exclusive with regard to the powers and responsibilities delegated to it. In the alternative, the declaration may provide as to some or all such powers that the authority of the board of a subassociation is concurrent with and subject to the authority of the board of the unit owners association, in which case the declaration must also contain standards and procedures for the review of the decisions of the board of the subassociation and procedures for resolving any dispute between the board of the unit owners association and the board of the subassociation.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 222](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20222); \]

2. An agreement of two or more common interest communities to merge or consolidate pursuant to subsection (1) of this section must be evidenced by an agreement prepared, executed, recorded, and certified by the president of the association of each of the preexisting common interest communities following approval by unit owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each common interest community required to terminate that common interest community. The agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is located and is not effective until recorded.

3. Every merger or consolidation agreement, and every amendment providing for a merger or consolidation made by a declarant when exercising a special declarant right, must identify the declaration that will apply to the resultant common interest community and provide for the reallocation of allocated interests among the units of the resultant common interest community either (a) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based or (b) by stating the percentage of overall allocated interests of the resultant common interest community that are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting common interest communities, and providing that the portion of the percentages allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting common interest community is equal to the percentages of allocated interests allocated to that unit by the declaration of the preexisting common interest community.

In a plat community or miscellaneous community, if the right is originally reserved in the declaration, the declarant, in addition to any other development right, may amend the declaration at any time during as many years as are specified in the declaration for adding additional real estate to the plat community or miscellaneous community without describing the location of that real estate in the original declaration. The amount of real estate added to the plat community or miscellaneous community pursuant to this section may not exceed ten percent of the real estate described in RCW 64.90.225(1)(b) together with any real estate that is described in the declaration for addition to the plat community or miscellaneous community, and the declarant may not increase the number of units in the plat community or miscellaneous community beyond the number stated in the original declaration pursuant to RCW 64.90.225(1)(c).

\[ [2018 c 277 § 224](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20224); \]

## 64.90.320 - Large scale communities.
1. The declaration for a common interest community may state that it is a large scale community if the declarant has reserved the development right to create at least five hundred units that may be used for residential purposes and, at the time of the reservation, that declarant owns or controls more than five hundred acres on which the units may be built.

2. If the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are satisfied, the declaration for the large scale community need not state a maximum number of units and need not contain any of the information required under RCW 64.90.225(1) (c) through (n) until the declaration is amended under subsection (3) of this section.

3. When each unit in a large scale community is conveyed to a purchaser, the declaration must contain:

4. The only real estate in a large scale community subject to this chapter are units that have been made subject to the declaration or that are being offered for sale and any other real estate described pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. Other real estate that is or may become part of the large scale community is only subject to other law and to any other restrictions and limitations that appear of record.

5. If the public offering statement conspicuously identifies the fact that the community is a large scale community, the disclosure requirements contained in RCW 64.90.600 through 64.90.695 apply only to units that have been made subject to the declaration or are being offered for sale in connection with the public offering statement and to any other real estate described pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.

6. Limitations in this chapter on the addition of unspecified real estate do not apply to a large scale community.

7. The period of declarant control of the association for a large scale community terminates in accordance with any conditions specified in the declaration or otherwise at the time the declarant, in a recorded instrument and after giving notice in a record to the board of the association, voluntarily surrenders all rights to control the activities of the association.

## 64.90.325 - Judicial termination.
1. If substantially all the units in a common interest community have been destroyed or abandoned or are uninhabitable and the available methods for giving notice under RCW 64.90.515 of a meeting of unit owners to consider termination under RCW 64.90.290 will not likely result in receipt of the notice, the board or any other interested person may commence an action seeking to terminate the common interest community in the superior court for any county in which a portion of the common interest community is located. If any portion of the common interest community is located in a county other than the county in which the action is commenced, the person commencing the action must record a copy of the judgment in the other county.

2. During the pendency of the action, the court may issue whatever orders it considers appropriate, including appointment of a receiver. After a hearing, the court may terminate the common interest community or reduce its size and may issue any other order the court considers to be in the best interest of the unit owners and persons holding an interest in the common interest community.

5. If a tenant of a unit owner violates the governing documents, in addition to exercising any of its powers against the unit owner, the association may:

   a. Exercise directly against the tenant the powers described in subsection (2)(l) of this section;

2. Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, and except as provided in RCW 64.90.320(7), a period of declarant control terminates no later than the earliest of:

   a. Sixty days after conveyance of seventy-five percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant;

   b. Two years after the last conveyance of a unit, except to a dealer;

Until such members are elected and take office, the existing board may continue to act on behalf of the association.

4. Within thirty days after the termination of any period of declarant control or, in the absence of such period, not later than a date that is sixty days after the conveyance of seventy-five percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, the board must schedule a transition meeting and provide notice to the unit owners in accordance with RCW 64.90.445(1)(c). At the transition meeting, the board elected by the unit owners must be elected in accordance with RCW 64.90.410(2).

The cost of the audit must be a common expense unless otherwise provided in the declaration. The accountant performing the audit must examine supporting documents and records, including the cash disbursements and related paid invoices, to determine if expenditures were for association purposes and the billings, cash receipts, and related records to determine if the declarant was charged for and paid the proper amount of assessments.

3. A declaration may provide for the appointment of specified positions on the board by persons other than the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant during or after the period of declarant control.

1. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a special declarant right created or reserved under this chapter may be transferred only by an instrument effecting the transfer and executed by the transferor, to be recorded in every county in which any portion of the common interest community is located. The transferee must provide the association with a copy of the recorded instrument, but the failure to furnish the copy does not invalidate the transfer.

2. Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:

   a. A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable for such warranty obligations arising before the transfer imposed upon the transferor under this chapter. Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor.

   b. If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the common interest community.

   c. If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant under this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights, whether arising before or after the transfer.

   d. A transferor is not liable for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.

3. Upon foreclosure of a security interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings of any unit owned by a declarant or real property in a common interest community that is subject to any special declarant rights, a person acquiring title to the real property being foreclosed or sold succeeds to all of the special declarant rights related to that real property held by that declarant and to any rights reserved in the declaration pursuant to RCW 64.90.275 and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices, and signs except to the extent the judgment or instrument effecting the transfer states otherwise.

4. Upon foreclosure of a security interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings of all interests in a common interest community owned by a declarant, any special declarant rights that are not transferred as stated in subsection (3) of this section terminate.

5. The liabilities and obligations of a person who succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows:

   a. A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor under this chapter or by the declaration.

   b. A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor who is an affiliate of a declarant, is subject to the obligations and liabilities imposed under this chapter or the declaration:

      i. On a declarant that relate to the successor's exercise of special declarant rights; and

      ii. On the declarant's transferor, other than:

          A.  Misrepresentations by any previous declarant;

          B.  Any warranty obligations pursuant to RCW 64.90.670 (1) through (3) on improvements made or contracted for, or units sold by, a previous declarant or that were made before the common interest community was created;

          C.  Breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or the previous declarant's appointees to the board; or

          D.  Any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer.

   c. A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices, and signs may not exercise any other special declarant right, and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability arising as a result of such reserved rights.

6. This section does not subject any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and obligations arising under this chapter or the declaration.

3. This section does not apply to:

   a. Any lease the termination of which would terminate the common interest community or reduce its size, unless the real estate subject to that lease was included in the common interest community for the purpose of avoiding the right of the association to terminate a lease under this section; or

   b. A proprietary lease.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 307](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20307); \]

\[ [2018 c 277 § 308](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20308); \]

## 64.90.440 - Maintenance, repair, replacement—Liability of unit owner—Inspection.
1. Except to the extent provided by the declaration, subsections (2) and (4) of this section, or RCW 64.90.470(8), the association must maintain, repair, and replace the common elements, including limited common elements, and each unit owner must maintain, repair, and replace that owner's unit.

2. The board may by rule designate physical components of the property for which a unit owner is otherwise responsible that present a heightened risk of damage or harm to persons or property if the physical components fail. The association may require that specific measures be taken by the unit owner or the association to diminish that risk of harm. If a unit owner fails to accomplish any necessary maintenance, repair, or replacement to those components, or fails to take any other measures required of the unit owner under this subsection, the association may, after notice to a unit owner and an opportunity to be heard, enter the unit in the manner pursuant to subsection (3) of this section to perform such maintenance, repair, replacement, or measure at the expense of that unit owner.

3. Upon prior notice, except in case of an emergency, each unit owner must afford to the association and the other unit owners, and to their agents or employees, access through that owner's unit and limited common elements reasonably necessary for the purposes stated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, including necessary inspections by the association. If damage is inflicted on the common elements or on any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner responsible for the damage, or the association if it is responsible, is liable for the prompt repair of the damage.

4. In addition to the liability that a declarant as a unit owner has under this chapter, the declarant alone is liable for all expenses in connection with real estate subject to development rights and no other unit owner and no other portion of the common interest community is subject to a claim for payment of those expenses. However, the declaration may provide that the expenses associated with the operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of a common element that the owners have a right to use must be paid by the association as a common expense. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any income or proceeds from real estate subject to development rights inures to the declarant.

5. In a plat community or miscellaneous community, if all development rights have expired with respect to any real estate, the declarant remains liable for all expenses of that real estate unless, upon expiration, the declaration provides that the real estate becomes common elements or units.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 309](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20309); \]

## 64.90.445 - Meetings.
1. The following requirements apply to unit owner meetings:

   a. A meeting of the association must be held at least once each year. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not cause a forfeiture or give cause for dissolution of the association and does not affect otherwise valid association acts.

   b. [Empty]

      i. An association must hold a special meeting of unit owners to address any matter affecting the common interest community or the association if its president, a majority of the board, or unit owners having at least twenty percent, or any lower percentage specified in the organizational documents, of the votes in the association request that the secretary call the meeting.

      ii. If the association does not provide notice to unit owners of a special meeting within thirty days after the requisite number or percentage of unit owners request the secretary to do so, the requesting members may directly provide notice to all the unit owners of the meeting. Only matters described in the meeting notice required in (c) of this subsection may be considered at a special meeting.

   c. An association must provide notice to unit owners of the time, date, and place of each annual and special unit owners meeting not less than fourteen days and not more than fifty days before the meeting date.

      i. The text of any proposed amendment to the declaration or organizational documents;

      ii. Any changes in the previously approved budget that result in a change in the assessment obligations; and

2. The following requirements apply to meetings of the board and committees authorized to act for the board:

   a. Meetings must be open to the unit owners except during executive sessions, but the board may expel or prohibit attendance by any person who, after warning by the chair of the meeting, disrupts the meeting. The board and those committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee. A final vote or action may not be taken during an executive session.

   b. An executive session may be held only to:

      i. Consult with the association's attorney concerning legal matters;

      ii. Discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings;

      iii. Discuss labor or personnel matters;

      iv. Discuss contracts, leases, and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage; or

      v. Prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the board or committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.

   c. For purposes of this subsection, a gathering of members of the board or committees at which the board or committee members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the board or committee. Board members and committee members may not use incidental or social gatherings to evade the open meeting requirements of this subsection.

   d. During the period of declarant control, the board must meet at least four times a year. At least one of those meetings must be held at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community. After the transition meeting, all board meetings must be at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the common interest community unless the unit owners amend the bylaws to vary the location of those meetings.

   e. At each board meeting, the board must provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment regarding matters affecting the common interest community and the association.

   f. Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners or the meeting is called to deal with an emergency, the secretary or other officer specified in the organizational documents must provide notice of each board meeting to each board member and to the unit owners. The notice must be given at least fourteen days before the meeting and must state the time, date, place, and agenda of the meeting.

   g. If any materials are distributed to the board before the meeting, the board must make copies of those materials reasonably available to the unit owners, except that the board need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to be considered in executive session.

   h. Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, fewer than all board members may participate in a regular or special meeting by or conduct a meeting through the use of any means of communication by which all board members participating can hear each other during the meeting. A board member participating in a meeting by these means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

   i. Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, the board may meet by participation of all board members by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process if:

      i. The meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how unit owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and

      ii. The process provides all unit owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment as provided in (e) of this subsection.

   j. After the transition meeting, unit owners may amend the organizational documents to vary the procedures for meetings described in (i) of this subsection.

Actions taken by unanimous consent must be kept as a record of the association with the meeting minutes. After the transition meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent only to undertake ministerial actions, actions subject to ratification by the unit owners, or to implement actions previously taken at a meeting of the board.

   l. A board member who is present at a board meeting at which any action is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the board member's dissent or abstention to such action is lodged with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before adjournment of the meeting or provided in a record to the secretary of the association immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right to dissent or abstain does not apply to a board member who voted in favor of such action at the meeting.

   m. A board member may not vote by proxy or absentee ballot.

   n. Even if an action by the board is not in compliance with this section, it is valid unless set aside by a court. A challenge to the validity of an action of the board for failure to comply with this section may not be brought more than ninety days after the minutes of the board of the meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever is later.

3. Minutes of all unit owner meetings and board meetings, excluding executive sessions, must be maintained in a record. The decision on each matter voted upon at a board meeting or unit owner meeting must be recorded in the minutes.

   a. Are present in person or by proxy at the beginning of the meeting;

   b. Have voted by absentee ballot; or

   c. Are present by any combination of (a) and (b) of this subsection.

2. Unless the organizational documents specify a larger number, a quorum of the board is present for purposes of determining the validity of any action taken at a meeting of the board only if individuals entitled to cast a majority of the votes on that board are present at the time a vote regarding that action is taken. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of the board members present is the act of the board unless a greater vote is required by the organizational documents.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 311](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20311); \]

If more than one of the unit owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the unit owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is a majority agreement if any one of the unit owners casts the votes allocated to the unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other unit owners of the unit.

   c. Unless a greater number or fraction of the votes in the association is required under this chapter or the declaration or organizational documents, a majority of the votes cast determines the outcome of any action of the association.

   d. Whenever proposals or board members are to be voted upon at a meeting, a unit owner may vote by duly executed absentee ballot if:

      i. The name of each candidate and the text of each proposal to be voted upon are set forth in a writing accompanying or contained in the notice of meeting; and

      ii. A ballot is provided by the association for such purpose.

   a. Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a directed or undirected proxy duly executed by a unit owner in the same manner as provided in RCW 24.06.110.

   b. If a unit is owned by more than one person, each unit owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other unit owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy.

   c. A unit owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of revocation to the secretary or the person presiding over a meeting of the association or by delivery of a subsequent proxy. The death or disability of a unit owner does not revoke a proxy given by the unit owner unless the person presiding over the meeting has actual notice of the death or disability.

   d. A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice.

   e. Unless stated otherwise in the proxy, a proxy terminates eleven months after its date of issuance.

6. Unless prohibited or limited by the declaration or organizational documents, an association may conduct a vote without a meeting. In that event, the following requirements apply:

   a. The association must notify the unit owners that the vote will be taken by ballot.

   b. The notice must state:

      i. The time and date by which a ballot must be delivered to the association to be counted, which may not be fewer than fourteen days after the date of the notice, and which deadline may be extended in accordance with (g) of this subsection;

   d. The ballot must set forth each proposed action and provide an opportunity to vote for or against the action.

   e. A ballot cast pursuant to this section may be revoked only by actual notice to the association of revocation. The death or disability of a unit owner does not revoke a ballot unless the association has actual notice of the death or disability prior to the date set forth in (b)(i) of this subsection.

   f. Approval by ballot pursuant to this subsection is valid only if the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action.

   g. If the association does not receive a sufficient number of votes to constitute a quorum or to approve the proposal by the date and time established for return of ballots, the board may extend the deadline for a reasonable period not to exceed eleven months upon further notice to all members in accordance with (b) of this subsection. In that event, all votes previously cast on the proposal must be counted unless subsequently revoked as provided in this section.

   h. A ballot or revocation is not effective until received by the association.

   i. The association must give notice to unit owners of any action taken pursuant to this subsection within a reasonable time after the action is taken.

   a. This section applies to lessees as if they were unit owners;

   b. Unit owners that have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on those specified matters; and

   c. Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records, and other rights respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.

8. Unit owners must also be given notice, in the manner provided in RCW 64.90.515, of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.

9. In any vote of the unit owners, votes allocated to a unit owned by the association must be cast in the same proportion as the votes cast on the matter by unit owners other than the association.

## 64.90.460 - Liability—Tolling.
1. A unit owner is not liable, solely by reason of being a unit owner, for an injury or damage arising out of the condition or use of the common elements. Neither the association nor any unit owner except the declarant is liable for that declarant's torts in connection with any part of the common interest community which that declarant must maintain.

2. [Empty]

   a. An action alleging a wrong done by the association, including an action arising out of the condition or use of the common elements, may be maintained only against the association and not against any unit owner.

   b. If the wrong occurred during any period of declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to any unit owner for (i) all tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or that unit owner and (ii) all costs that the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission by the association.

   c. If a declarant is liable to an association under this section, the declarant is also liable for all expenses of litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by the association.

3. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in RCW 64.90.680 with respect to warranty claims, any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action against a declarant under this chapter is tolled until any period of declarant control terminates.

   b. A unit owner is not precluded from maintaining an action contemplated under this section because that person is a unit owner, board member, or officer of the association. Liens resulting from judgments against the association are governed under RCW 64.90.490.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 313](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20313); \]

## 64.90.465 - Conveyance or encumbrance of common elements.
1. [Empty]

   a. In a common interest community other than a cooperative, portions of the common elements may be conveyed or subjected to a security interest by the association if unit owners entitled to cast at least eighty percent of the votes in the association, including eighty percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action; but all unit owners of units to which any limited common element is allocated must agree to convey that limited common element or subject it to a security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

   b. Proceeds of the sale or a loan are an asset of the association, but the proceeds of the sale of limited common elements must be distributed equitably among the unit owners of units to which the limited common elements were allocated. This subsection (1) does not apply to the incorporation of common elements into units as a result of relocating unit boundaries pursuant to RCW 64.90.260, to subdividing or combining units pursuant to RCW 64.90.265, or to eminent domain proceedings pursuant to RCW 64.90.030.

2. [Empty]

   a. Part of a cooperative may be conveyed and all or part of a cooperative may be subjected to a security interest by the association if unit owners entitled to cast at least eighty percent of the votes in the association, including eighty percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action; but, if fewer than all of the units or limited common elements are to be conveyed or subjected to a security interest, all unit owners of those units, or the units to which those limited common elements are allocated, must agree to convey those units or limited common elements or subject them to a security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

   b. Proceeds of the sale or a loan are an asset of the association. Any purported conveyance or other voluntary transfer of an entire cooperative, unless made pursuant to RCW 64.90.290, is void. This subsection (2) does not apply to the incorporation of common elements into units as a result of relocating unit boundaries pursuant to RCW 64.90.260, to subdividing or combining units pursuant to RCW 64.90.265, or to eminent domain proceedings pursuant to RCW 64.90.030.

3. An agreement to convey common elements in a common interest community other than a cooperative, or to subject them to a security interest, or in a cooperative, an agreement to convey any part of a cooperative or subject it to a security interest, must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications of an agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications of the agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is situated and is effective only upon recordation.

4. The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract to convey or dedicate an interest in a common interest community pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsection (1), (2), or (3) of this section. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.

5. Unless made pursuant to this section, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary transfer of common elements or of any other part of a cooperative is void.

6. A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements or of a cooperative pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its rights of access and support.

7. Unless the declaration requires a higher percentage, if the consent of eligible mortgagees holding security interests on at least eighty percent of the units subject to security interests held by eligible mortgagees on the day the unit owners' agreement under subsection (3) of this section is recorded, is obtained:

   a. A conveyance of common elements pursuant to this section terminates both the undivided interests in those common elements allocated to the units and the security interests in those undivided interests held by all persons holding security interests in the units; and

   b. An encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section has priority over all preexisting encumbrances on the undivided interests in those common elements held by all persons holding security interests in the units.

8. The consents of eligible mortgagees, or a certificate of the secretary affirming that the requisite percentage of eligible mortgagees have consented, may be recorded at any time before the date on which the agreement under subsection (3) of this section becomes void. Such consents or certificates recorded are valid from the date they are recorded for purposes of calculating the percentage of consenting eligible mortgagees, regardless of later conveyance or encumbrances on those units. If the required percentage of eligible mortgagees consent, a conveyance or encumbrance of common elements does not affect interests having priority over the declaration or created by the association after the declaration was recorded.

9. In a cooperative, the association may acquire, hold, encumber, or convey a proprietary lease without complying with this section.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 314](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20314); \]

## 64.90.470 - Insurance.
1. Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association must maintain in its own name, to the extent reasonably available and subject to reasonable deductibles:

   a. Property insurance on the common elements and, in a plat community or miscellaneous community, also on property that must become common elements, insuring against risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against, which insurance, after application of any deductibles, must be not less than eighty percent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies;

   b. Commercial general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the board, but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements and, in cooperatives, of all units;

   c. Fidelity insurance; and

   d. Other insurance required under the declaration.

2. In the case of a building that contains units divided by horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, or vertical boundaries that comprise common walls between units, the insurance maintained under subsection (1)(a) of this section, to the extent reasonably available, must include the units and, unless provided otherwise in the declaration, all improvements and betterments to the units.

3. If the insurance described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section is not reasonably available, the association must promptly cause notice of that fact to be given to all unit owners. The association may carry any other insurance it considers appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.

4. Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section must provide that:

   a. Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the unit owner's interest in the common elements or membership in the association;

   b. The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of the unit owner's household;

   c. Any act or omission by a unit owner, unless acting within the unit owner's scope of authority on behalf of the association, does not void the policy and is not a condition to recovery under the policy; and

   d. If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.

5. Any loss covered by the property insurance policy under subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a security interest. The insurance trustee or the association must hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the association, unit owners, and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to subsection (8) of this section, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or replacement of the damaged property, and the association, unit owners, and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or replaced, or the common interest community is terminated.

6. An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the unit owner's own benefit.

7. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section must issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon a request made in a record, to any unit owner or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy unless the insurer has complied with all applicable provisions of chapter 48.18 RCW pertaining to the cancellation or nonrenewal of contracts of insurance. The insurer may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy without complying with this section.

8. Any portion of the common interest community for which insurance is required under this section that is damaged or destroyed must be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless:

   a. The common interest community is terminated, in which case RCW 64.90.290 applies;

   b. Repair or replacement would be illegal; or

   c. Eighty percent of the unit owners, including every unit owner of a unit or assigned limited common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.

9. The cost of repair or replacement not paid from insurance proceeds is a common expense. If all of the damaged or destroyed portions of the common interest community are not repaired or replaced:

   a. The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the common interest community; and

   b. Except to the extent that other persons will be distributees:

      i. The insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements that are not repaired or replaced must be distributed to the unit owners of those units and the unit owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and

      ii. The remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, as follows:

          A.  In a condominium, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units; and

          B.  In a cooperative, plat community, or miscellaneous community, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all the units.

10. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under RCW 64.90.030, and the association promptly must prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.

11. The provisions of this section may be varied or waived as provided in the declaration if all units of a common interest community are restricted to nonresidential use.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 315](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20315); \]

## 64.90.475 - Accounts and records—Reconciliation.
1. The association must establish and maintain its accounts and records in a manner that will enable it to credit assessments for common expenses and specially allocated expenses, including allocations to reserves, and other income to the association, and to charge expenditures, to the account of the appropriate units in accordance with the provisions of the declaration.

2. To assure that the unit owners are correctly assessed for the actual expenses of the association, the accounts of the association must be reconciled at least annually unless the board determines that a reconciliation would not result in a material savings to any unit owner. Unless provided otherwise in the declaration, any surplus funds of the association remaining after the payment of or provision for common expenses and any prepayment of reserves must be paid annually to the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liabilities or credited to them to reduce their future common expense assessments.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 316](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20316); \]

## 64.90.480 - Assessments and capital contributions.
1. [Empty]

   a. Assessments for common expenses and those specially allocated expenses that are subject to inclusion in a budget must be made at least annually based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association in the manner provided in RCW 64.90.525.

   b. Assessments for common expenses and specially allocated expenses must commence on all units that have been created upon the conveyance of the first unit in the common interest community; however, the declarant may delay commencement of assessments for some or all common expenses or specially allocated expenses, in which event the declarant must pay all of the common expenses or specially allocated expenses that have been delayed. In a common interest community in which units may be added pursuant to reserved development rights, the declarant may delay commencement of assessments for such units in the same manner.

2. The declaration may provide that, upon closing of the first conveyance of each unit to a purchaser or first occupancy of a unit, whichever occurs first, the association may assess and collect a working capital contribution for such unit. The working capital contribution may be collected prior to the commencement of common assessments under subsection (1) of this section. A working capital contribution may not be used to defray expenses that are the obligation of the declarant.

3. Except as provided otherwise in this section, all common expenses must be assessed against all the units in accordance with their common expense liabilities, subject to the right of the declarant to delay commencement of certain common expenses under subsections (1) and (2) of this section. Any past due assessment or installment of past due assessment bears interest at the rate established by the association pursuant to RCW 64.90.485.

4. The declaration may provide that any of the following expenses of the association must be assessed against the units on some basis other than common expense liability. If and to the extent the declaration so provides, the association must assess:

   a. Expenses associated with the operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of any specified limited common element against the units to which that limited common element is assigned, equally or in any other proportion that the declaration provides;

   b. Expenses specified in the declaration as benefiting fewer than all of the units or their unit owners exclusively against the units benefited in proportion to their common expense liability or in any other proportion that the declaration provides;

   c. The costs of insurance in proportion to risk; and

   d. The costs of one or more specified utilities in proportion to respective usage or upon the same basis as such utility charges are made by the utility provider.

5. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.

6. To the extent that any expense of the association is caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence of any unit owner or that unit owner's tenant, guest, invitee, or occupant, the association may assess that expense against the unit owner's unit after notice and an opportunity to be heard, even if the association maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common expense.

7. If the declaration so provides, to the extent that any expense of the association is caused by the negligence of any unit owner or that unit owner's tenant, guest, invitee, or occupant, the association may assess that expense against the unit owner's unit after notice and an opportunity to be heard, to the extent of the association's deductible and any expenses not covered under an insurance policy issued to the association.

8. In the event of a loss or damage to a unit that would be covered by the association's property insurance policy, excluding policies for earthquake, flood, or similar losses that have higher than standard deductibles, but that is within the deductible under that policy and if the declaration so provides, the association may assess the amount of the loss up to the deductible against that unit. This subsection does not prevent a unit owner from asserting a claim against another person for the amount assessed if that other person would be liable for the damages under general legal principles.

9. If common expense liabilities are reallocated, assessments and any installment of assessments not yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 317](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20317); \]

## 64.90.485 - Liens—Enforcement—Notice of delinquency. (Effective until January 1, 2024.)
1. The association has a statutory lien on each unit for any unpaid assessment against the unit from the time such assessment is due.

2. A lien under this section has priority over all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except:

   a. Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a cooperative, liens and encumbrances that the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to;

   b. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due or, in a cooperative, a security interest encumbering only the unit owner's interest and perfected before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due; and

   c. Liens for real estate taxes and other state or local governmental assessments or charges against the unit or cooperative.

3. [Empty]

   a. A lien under this section also has priority over the security interests described in subsection (2)(b) of this section to the extent of an amount equal to the following:

      i. The common expense assessments, excluding any amounts for capital improvements, based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to RCW 64.90.480(1), along with any specially allocated assessments that are properly assessable against the unit under such periodic budget, which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding the institution of proceedings to foreclose either the association's lien or a security interest described in subsection (2)(b) of this section;

      ii. The association's actual costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in foreclosing its lien but incurred after the giving of the notice described in (a)(iii) of this subsection; provided, however, that the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees that will have priority under this subsection (3)(a)(ii) shall not exceed two thousand dollars or an amount equal to the amounts described in (a)(i) of this subsection, whichever is less;

      iii. The amounts described in (a)(ii) of this subsection shall be prior only to the security interest of the holder of a security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due and only if the association has given that holder not less than sixty days' prior written notice that the owner of the unit is in default in payment of an assessment. The notice shall contain:

           A.  Name of the borrower;

           B.  Recording date of the trust deed or mortgage;

           C.  Recording information;

           D.  Name of condominium, unit owner, and unit designation stated in the declaration or applicable supplemental declaration;

           E.  Amount of unpaid assessment; and

           F.  A statement that failure to, within sixty days of the written notice, submit the association payment of six months of assessments as described in (a)(i) of this subsection will result in the priority of the amounts described in (a)(ii) of this subsection; and

      iv. Upon payment of the amounts described in (a)(i) and (ii) of this subsection by the holder of a security interest, the association's lien described in this subsection (3)(a) shall thereafter be fully subordinated to the lien of such holder's security interest on the unit.

   b. For the purposes of this subsection:

      i. "Institution of proceedings" means either:

         A.  The date of recording of a notice of trustee's sale by a deed of trust beneficiary;

         B.  The date of commencement, pursuant to applicable court rules, of an action for judicial foreclosure either by the association or by the holder of a recorded security interest; or

         C.  The date of recording of a notice of intention to forfeit in a real estate contract forfeiture proceeding by the vendor under a real estate contract.

      ii. "Capital improvements" does not include making, in the ordinary course of management, repairs to common elements or replacements of the common elements with substantially similar items, subject to: (A) Availability of materials and products, (B) prevailing law, or (C) sound engineering and construction standards then prevailing.

   c. The adoption of a periodic budget that purports to allocate to a unit any fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees and costs incurred for services unrelated to the foreclosure of the association's lien, other collection charges, or specially allocated assessments assessed under RCW 64.90.480 (6) or (7) does not cause any such items to be included in the priority amount affecting such unit.

4. Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not affect the priority of mechanics' or material suppliers' liens to the extent that law of this state other than chapter 277, Laws of 2018 gives priority to such liens, or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association.

5. A lien under this section is not subject to chapter 6.13 RCW.

6. If the association forecloses its lien under this section nonjudicially pursuant to chapter 61.24 RCW, as provided under subsection (13) of this section, the association is not entitled to the lien priority provided for under subsection (3) of this section, and is subject to the limitations on deficiency judgments as provided in chapter 61.24 RCW.

7. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority as to each other, and any foreclosure of one such lien shall not affect the lien of the other.

8. Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the statutory lien created under this section. Further notice or recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is not required, but is not prohibited.

9. A lien for unpaid assessments and the personal liability for payment of those assessments are extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien or collect the debt are instituted within six years after the full amount of the assessments sought to be recovered becomes due.

10. This section does not prohibit actions against unit owners to recover sums for which subsection (1) of this section creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

11. The association upon written request must furnish to a unit owner or a mortgagee a statement signed by an officer or authorized agent of the association setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments or the priority amount against that unit, or both. The statement must be furnished within fifteen days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the board, and every unit owner unless, and to the extent, known by the recipient to be false. The liability of a recipient who reasonably relies upon the statement must not exceed the amount set forth in any statement furnished pursuant to this section or RCW 64.90.640(1)(b).

12. In a cooperative, upon nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, the unit owner may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided under this section.

13. The association's lien may be foreclosed in accordance with (a) and (b) of this subsection.

    a. In a common interest community other than a cooperative, the association's lien may be foreclosed judicially in accordance with chapter 61.12 RCW, subject to any rights of redemption under chapter 6.23 RCW.

    b. The lien may be enforced nonjudicially in the manner set forth in chapter 61.24 RCW for nonjudicial foreclosure of deeds of trust if the declaration: Contains a grant of the common interest community in trust to a trustee qualified under RCW 61.24.010 to secure the obligations of the unit owners to the association for the payment of assessments, contains a power of sale, provides in its terms that the units are not used principally for agricultural purposes, and provides that the power of sale is operative in the case of a default in the obligation to pay assessments. The association or its authorized representative may purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the unit. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption is eight months.

    c. In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or by power of sale under (b) of this subsection.

    d. In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are personal property, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a security interest under chapter 62A.9A RCW.

14. If the unit owner's interest in a unit in a cooperative is real estate, the following requirements apply:

    a. The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place. The association must give to the unit owner and any lessee of the unit owner reasonable notice in a record of the time, date, and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time and date after which a private conveyance may be made. Such notice must also be sent to any other person that has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required under this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. A sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.

    b. Unless otherwise agreed to or as stated in this section, the unit owner is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale.

    c. The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:

       i. The reasonable expenses of sale;

       ii. The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; the reasonable expenses of holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges and premiums on insurance; and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and other legal expenses incurred by the association;

       iii. Satisfaction of the association's lien;

       iv. Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and

       v. Remittance of any excess to the unit owner.

    d. A good-faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with this section. The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance.

    e. At any time before the association has conveyed a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its conveyance under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner's default and prevent sale or other conveyance by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the creditor.

15. In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and owing to a unit owner before commencement or during pendency of the action. The receivership is governed under chapter 7.60 RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of rights under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.

16. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mortgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection.

17. In addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments. In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.

18. The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments.

19. The association is entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment.

1. In a condominium, plat community, and miscellaneous community:

   a. Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection, a judgment for money against the association perfected under RCW 4.64.020 is not a lien on the common elements, but is a lien in favor of the judgment lienholder against all of the other real estate of the association and all of the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered. Other property of a unit owner is not subject to the claims of creditors of the association.

   b. If the association has granted a security interest in the common elements to a creditor of the association pursuant to RCW 64.90.465, the holder of that security interest must exercise its right against the common elements before its judgment lien on any unit may be enforced.

   c. Whether perfected before or after the creation of the common interest community, if a lien, other than a deed of trust or mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the common interest community, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to the unit, and the lienholder, upon receipt of payment, must promptly deliver a release of the lien covering that unit. The amount of the payment must be proportionate to the ratio that the unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners that are subject to the lien. After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that unit owner's unit for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien.

   d. A judgment against the association must be recorded and indexed in the name of the common interest community and the association and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the units.

2. In a cooperative:

   a. If the association receives notice of an impending foreclosure on all or any portion of the association's real estate, the association must promptly transmit a copy of that notice to each unit owner of a unit located within the real estate to be foreclosed. Failure of the association to transmit the notice does not affect the validity of the foreclosure.

   b. Whether a unit owner's unit is subject to the claims of the association's creditors, other property of a unit owner is not subject to those claims.

If this public offering statement is first provided to you seven days or less before you sign your contract for the purchase of your unit, you have the right to cancel, before conveyance of the unit, the executed contract by delivering, no later than the seventh day after first receiving this public offering statement, a notice of cancellation pursuant to section (3) of this notice. If this public offering statement is first provided to you less than seven days before the closing date for the conveyance of your unit, you may, before conveyance of your unit to you, extend the closing date to a date not more than seven days after you first received this public offering statement, so that you may have seven days to cancel your contract for the purchase of your unit.

2. You have no right to cancel your contract upon receipt of an amendment to this public offering statement; however, this does not eliminate any right to rescind your contract, due to the disclosure of the information in the amendment, that is otherwise available to you under generally applicable contract law.

3. If you elect to cancel your contract pursuant to this notice, you may do so by hand-delivering notice of cancellation, or by mailing notice of cancellation by prepaid United States mail, to the seller at the address set forth in this public offering statement or at the address of the seller's registered agent for service of process.

Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made to the seller by you before cancellation must be refunded promptly."

   b. "OTHER DOCUMENTS CREATING BINDING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. This public offering statement is a summary of some of the significant aspects of purchasing a unit in this common interest community. The governing documents and the purchase agreement are complex, contain other important information, and create binding legal obligations.

You may not rely on any statement, promise, model, depiction, or description unless it is (1) contained in the public offering statement delivered to you or (2) made in writing signed by the declarant or dealer or the declarant's or dealer's agent identified in the public offering statement. A statement of opinion, or a commendation of the real estate, its quality, or its value, does not create a warranty, and a statement, promise, model, depiction, or description does not create a warranty if it discloses that it is only proposed, is not representative, or is subject to change."

   d. "MODEL UNITS. Model units are intended to provide you with a general idea of what a finished unit might look like. Units being offered for sale may vary from the model unit in terms of floor plan, fixtures, finishes, and equipment.

   h. "ASSOCIATION INSURANCE.

You and your personal insurance agent should read the declaration and the association's policy prior to closing to determine what insurance is required of the association and unit owners, unit owners' rights and duties, what is and is not covered by the association's policy, and what additional insurance you should obtain."

1. The purchaser may cancel a contract for the purchase of the unit within seven days after first receiving the public offering statement.

If the public offering statement is first provided to a purchaser seven days or less before the purchaser signs a contract for the purchase of a unit, the purchaser, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, may cancel the contract by delivering, no later than the seventh day after first receiving the public offering statement, a notice of cancellation, delivered pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. If the public offering statement is first provided to a purchaser less than seven days before the closing date for the conveyance of that unit, the purchaser may, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, extend the closing date to a date not more than seven days after the purchaser first received the public offering statement.

2. A purchaser does not have the right under this section to cancel a contract upon receipt of an amendment to a public offering statement. This subsection must not be construed to eliminate any right that is otherwise available to the purchaser under generally applicable contract law to rescind the contract due to the disclosure of the information in the amendment.

3. If a purchaser elects to cancel a contract under subsection (1) of this section, the purchaser may do so by hand-delivering notice of cancellation, or by mailing notice of cancellation by prepaid United States mail, to the declarant at the address set forth in the public offering statement or at the address of the declarant's registered agent for service of process. The date of such notice is the date of receipt of delivery, if hand-delivered, or the date of deposit in the United States mail, if mailed. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made to the seller by the purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. There is no liability for failure to deliver any amendment unless such failure would have entitled the purchaser under generally applicable legal principles to cancel the contract for the purchase of the unit had the undisclosed information been evident to the purchaser before the closing of the purchase.

4. The language of the notice required under RCW 64.90.610(2)(a) must not be construed to modify the rights set forth in this section.

      i. Set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section;

      ii. Be delivered pursuant to notice requirements set forth in RCW 59.12.040;

          B.  Contact information for the city or county relocation assistance program, which must include, at a minimum, a telephone number of the city or county department that administers the relocation assistance program for conversion buildings.

   b. A residential tenant or residential subtenant may not be required to vacate upon less than 120 days' notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other residential tenants' or residential subtenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, or act of unlawful detainer as defined in RCW 59.12.030, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period except as provided in (c) of this subsection.

   c. At the declarant's option, the declarant may provide all residential tenants and residential subtenants in a single conversion building with an option to terminate their lease or rental agreements without cause or consequence after providing the declarant with thirty days' notice. In such case, residential tenants and residential subtenants continue to have access to relocation assistance under subsection (6)(e)(i) of this section.

   d. [Empty]

      i. Nothing in this subsection (1) waives or repeals RCW 59.18.200(2)(b).

      ii. Failure to give notice as required under this section is a defense to an action for possession.

   e. The city or county in which the property is located may require the declarant to forward a copy of the conversion notice required in this subsection (1) to the appropriately designated department or agency in the city or county for the purpose of maintaining a list of common interest communities containing conversion buildings in the jurisdiction.

   a. For 60 days after delivery or mailing of the notice described in subsection (1) of this section, the person required to give the notice must offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the residential tenant or residential subtenant who leases that unit. If a residential tenant or residential subtenant fails to purchase the unit during that 60-day period, the offeror may offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following 180 days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the residential tenant or residential subtenant only if:

      ii. Such residential tenant or residential subtenant fails to accept the offer in writing within 10 days following the mailing of the offer to the tenant or subtenant.

   b. This subsection (2) does not apply to any unit in a conversion building if that unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.

3. If a seller, in violation of subsection (2) of this section, conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no actual knowledge of the violation, the recording of the deed conveying the unit, or, in a cooperative, the conveyance of the unit, extinguishes any right a residential tenant or residential subtenant may have under subsection (2) of this section to purchase that unit, but does not affect the right of a residential tenant or residential subtenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of subsection (2) of this section.

4. If a notice of conversion specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated and otherwise complies with this chapter and chapter 59.18 RCW, the notice also constitutes a notice to vacate specified under chapter 59.18 RCW.

5. This section does not permit termination of a lease or sublease by a declarant in violation of its terms.

6. Notwithstanding RCW 64.90.025, a city or county may by appropriate ordinance require with respect to any conversion building within the jurisdiction of the city or county that:

The inspection must be made within 45 days of the declarant's written request, and the report must be issued within 14 days of the inspection being made. The inspection may not be required with respect to any building for which a final certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city or county within the preceding 24 months, and any fee imposed for the making of such inspection may not exceed the fee that would be imposed for the making of such an inspection for a purpose other than complying with this subsection (6)(a).

   b. Prior to the conveyance of any residential unit within a conversion building, other than a conveyance to a declarant or dealer, or affiliate of either:

      i. All violations disclosed in the inspection report provided for in (a) of this subsection, and not otherwise waived by the city or county, must be repaired; and

      ii. A certification must be obtained from the city or county that such repairs have been made. The certification must be based on a reinspection to be made within seven days of the declarant's written request and be issued within seven days of the reinspection being made;

   c. The repairs required to be made under (b) of this subsection must be warranted by the declarant against defects due to workmanship or materials for a period of one year following the completion of such repairs;

   d. Prior to the conveyance of any residential unit within a conversion building, other than a conveyance to a declarant or dealer, or affiliate of either:

      i. The declarant must establish and maintain, during the one-year warranty period provided under (c) of this subsection, an account containing a sum equal to 10 percent of the actual cost of making the repairs required under (b) of this subsection;

      ii. During the one-year warranty period, the funds in the account must be used exclusively for paying the actual cost of making repairs required, or for otherwise satisfying claims made, under such warranty;

      iii. Following the expiration of the one-year warranty period, any funds remaining in the account must be immediately disbursed to the declarant; and

   e. [Empty]

      i. A declarant must pay relocation assistance, in an amount to be determined by the city or county, which may not exceed a sum equal to three months of the residential tenant's or residential subtenant's rent at the time the conversion notice required under subsection (1) of this section is received, to residential tenants or residential subtenants:

         A.  Who do not elect to purchase a unit in the common interest community;

         B.  Who are in lawful occupancy for residential purposes of a unit in the conversion building; and

         C.  Whose annual household income from all sources, on the date of the notice described in subsection (1) of this section, was less than an amount equal to 80 percent of:

             I. The annual median income for comparably sized households in the standard metropolitan statistical area, as defined and established by the United States department of housing and urban development, in which the conversion building is located; or

             II. If the conversion building is not within a standard metropolitan statistical area, the annual median income for comparably sized households in the state of Washington, as defined and determined by said department.

The household size of a unit must be based on the number of persons actually in lawful occupancy of the unit.

Except as authorized under (g) of this subsection, a declarant and any dealer may not begin any construction, remodeling, or repairs to any interior portion of an occupied building that is to become a conversion building during the 120-day notice period provided for in subsection (1) of this section unless all residential tenants and residential subtenants who have elected not to purchase a unit in the common interest community and who are in lawful occupancy in the building have vacated the premises. For the purposes of this subsection:

      i. "Construction, remodeling, or repairs" means the work that is done for the purpose of establishing or selling units in a conversion building, and does not mean the work that is done to maintain the building or lot for the residential use of the existing residential tenants or residential subtenants; and

      ii. "Occupied building" means a stand-alone structure occupied by residential tenants or residential subtenants and does not include other stand-alone buildings located on the property or detached common area facilities; and

Such violations do not invalidate the creation of the common interest community or the conveyance of any interest in the common interest community.

1. Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, express warranties made by any declarant or dealer to a purchaser of a unit in a condominium, if relied upon by the purchaser in purchasing the unit, are created as follows:

   a. Any written affirmation of fact or written promise that relates to the unit, its use, or rights appurtenant to the unit or its use, improvements to the condominium that would directly benefit the unit, or the right to use or have the benefit of facilities not located in the condominium creates an express warranty that the unit and related rights and uses will not materially deviate from the affirmation or promise.

   b. Any written description of the physical characteristics of the condominium at the time the purchase agreement is executed, including plans and specifications of or for improvements, creates an express warranty that the condominium will conform to the written description in all material respects.

   c. Any written description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the condominium, including plats or surveys, creates an express warranty that the condominium will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerances.

   d. A written statement that a purchaser may put a unit only to a specified use is an express warranty that the specified use is lawful.

2. Subject to subsection (3) of this section, neither formal words, such as "warranty" or "guarantee," nor a specific intention to make a warranty are necessary to create an express warranty, but a statement of opinion or a commendation of the real estate, its quality, or its value does not create a warranty, and a statement, promise, model, depiction, or description does not create a warranty if it discloses that it is only proposed, is not representative, or is subject to change.

3. A purchaser may not rely on any statement, affirmation, promise, model, depiction, or description unless it is contained in the public offering statement delivered to the purchaser or made in a record signed by the declarant or dealer, or the declarant's or dealer's agent identified in the public offering statement.

4. Any conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all express warranties of quality made by the declarant or dealer.

\[ [2018 c 277 § 414](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6175-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20277%20§%20414); \]

## 64.90.670 - Implied warranties of quality.
1. A declarant and any dealer warrants to a purchaser of a condominium unit that the unit will be in at least as good condition at the earlier of the time of the conveyance or delivery of possession as it was at the time of contracting, except for reasonable wear and tear and damage by casualty or condemnation.

2. A declarant and any dealer impliedly warrants to a purchaser of a condominium unit that the unit and the common elements in the condominium are suitable for the ordinary uses of real estate of its type and that any improvements made or contracted for by such declarant or dealer will be:

   a. Free from defective materials;

   b. Constructed in accordance with engineering and construction standards, including applicable building codes, generally accepted in the state of Washington at the time of construction; and

   c. Constructed in a workmanlike manner.

3. A declarant and any dealer warrants to a purchaser of a condominium unit that may be used for residential use that an existing use, continuation of which is contemplated by the parties, does not violate applicable law at the earlier of the time of conveyance or delivery of possession.

4. Warranties imposed under this section may be excluded or modified as specified in RCW 64.90.675.

5. For purposes of this section, improvements made or contracted for by an affiliate of a declarant are made or contracted for by the declarant.

6. Any conveyance of a condominium unit transfers to the purchaser all of a declarant's or dealer's implied warranties of quality.

7. [Empty]

   a. In a proceeding for breach of any of the obligations arising under this section, the purchaser must show that the alleged breach has adversely affected or will adversely affect the performance of that portion of the unit or common elements alleged to be in breach. Nothing in this section limits the ability of a board to bring claims on behalf of two or more unit owners pursuant to RCW 64.90.405(2)(d).

   b. To establish an adverse effect on performance, the purchaser is required to prove that the alleged breach:

      i. Is more than technical;

      ii. Is significant to a reasonable person; and

      iii. Has caused or will cause physical damage to the unit or common elements; has materially impaired the performance of mechanical, electrical, plumbing, elevator, or similar building equipment; or presents an actual, unreasonable safety risk to the occupants of the condominium.

8. Proof of breach of any obligation arising under this section is not proof of damages. Damages awarded for a breach of a warranty arising under subsection (2) of this section are the reasonable cost of repairs. However, if it is established that the cost of such repairs is clearly disproportionate to the loss in market value caused by the breach, damages are limited to the loss in market value.

   b. Are excluded by written expression of disclaimer, such as "as is," "with all faults," or other language that in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties.

2. With respect to a purchaser of a condominium unit that may be used for residential use, no disclaimer of implied warranties of quality under RCW 64.90.670 is effective, except that a declarant and any dealer may disclaim liability in an instrument for one or more specified defects or failures to comply with applicable law, if:

   a. The declarant or dealer knows or has reason to believe that the specific defects or failures exist at the time of disclosure;

   b. The disclaimer specifically describes the defects or failures;

   c. The disclaimer includes a statement as to the effect of the defects or failures;

4. If a written notice of claim is served under RCW 64.50.020 within the time prescribed for the filing of an action under this chapter, the statutes of limitation in this chapter and any applicable statutes of repose for construction-related claims are tolled until sixty days after the period of time during which the filing of an action is barred under RCW 64.50.020.
