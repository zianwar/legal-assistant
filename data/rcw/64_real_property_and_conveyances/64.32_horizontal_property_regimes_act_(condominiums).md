Such individual payments shall be computed by reference to the percentages appearing on the declaration. Subsequent to any such payment, discharge, or satisfaction, the apartment and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant thereto shall thereafter be free and clear of the liens so paid, satisfied, or discharged. Such partial payment, satisfaction, or discharge shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce his or her rights against any apartment and the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant thereto not so paid, satisfied, or discharged.

## 64.32.200 - Assessments for common expenses—Enforcement of collection—Liens and foreclosures—Liability of mortgagee or purchaser—Notice of delinquency. (Effective until January 1, 2024.)
1. The declaration may provide for the collection of all sums assessed by the association of apartment owners for the share of the common expenses chargeable to any apartment and the collection may be enforced in any manner provided in the declaration including, but not limited to, (a) ten days notice shall be given the delinquent apartment owner to the effect that unless such assessment is paid within ten days any or all utility services will be forthwith severed and shall remain severed until such assessment is paid, or (b) collection of such assessment may be made by such lawful method of enforcement, judicial or extra-judicial, as may be provided in the declaration and/or bylaws.

2. All sums assessed by the association of apartment owners but unpaid for the share of the common expenses chargeable to any apartment shall constitute a lien on such apartment prior to all other liens except only (a) tax liens on the apartment in favor of any assessing unit and/or special district, and (b) all sums unpaid on all mortgages of record. Such lien is not subject to the ban against execution or forced sales of homesteads under RCW 6.13.080 and, subject to the provisions in subsection (4) of this section, may be foreclosed by suit by the manager or board of directors, acting on behalf of the apartment owners, in like manner as a mortgage of real property. In any such foreclosure the apartment owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the apartment, if so provided in the bylaws, and the plaintiff in such foreclosures shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the same. The manager or board of directors, acting on behalf of the apartment owners, shall have power, unless prohibited by the declaration, to bid on the apartment at foreclosure sale, and to acquire and hold, lease, mortgage, and convey the same. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment, the period of redemption shall be eight months after the sale. Suit to recover any judgment for any unpaid common expenses shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the liens securing the same.

3. Where the mortgagee of a mortgage of record or other purchaser of an apartment obtains possession of the apartment as a result of foreclosure of the mortgage, such possessor, his or her successors and assigns shall not be liable for the share of the common expenses or assessments by the association of apartment owners chargeable to such apartment which became due prior to such possession. Such unpaid share of common expenses of assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses collectible from all of the apartment owners including such possessor, his or her successors and assigns.

4. An association, or the manager or board of directors on its behalf, may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on an apartment under this section unless:

   a. The apartment owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes at least a sum equal to the greater of:

      i. Three months or more of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account; or

      ii. $200 of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account;

   b. At or after the date that assessments have become past due for at least 90 days, the association has mailed, by first-class mail, to the owner, at the apartment address and to any other address which the owner has provided to the association, a notice of delinquency, which shall state as follows:

## 64.32.230 - Destruction or damage to all or part of property—Disposition.
If, within ninety days of the date of damage or destruction to all or part of the property it is not determined by the apartment owners to repair, reconstruct, or rebuild in accordance with the original plan, or by a unanimous vote of all apartment owners to do otherwise, then and in that event:

   c. Owners who have consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke this consent by delivering a revocation to the association of apartment owners in writing.

   d. The consent of any apartment owner is revoked if the association is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices and this inability becomes known to the secretary of the association of apartment owners or any other person responsible for giving the notice.

   c. An apartment owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of revocation to the secretary or the person presiding over a meeting of the association or by delivery of a subsequent proxy.

If the association does not receive a sufficient number of votes to constitute a quorum or to approve the proposal by the date and time established for return of ballots, the board of directors may extend the deadline for a reasonable period not to exceed eleven months upon further notice to all members in accordance with (b) of this subsection. In that event, all votes previously cast on the proposal must be counted unless subsequently revoked as provided in this section.

4. If approval is required for the installation or use of an electric vehicle charging station, an association of apartment owners must approve the installation in a designated parking space if the installation is reasonably possible and the apartment owner agrees in writing to:
