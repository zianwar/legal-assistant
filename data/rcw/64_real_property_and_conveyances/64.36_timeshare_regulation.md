## 64.36.025 - Timeshare interest reservation—Definition—Registration required—Promoter's obligations—Deposits—Escrow—Purchaser cancellation rights—Insolvency prior to completion.
1. For the purpose of this section, "timeshare interest reservation" means a revocable right to purchase an interest in a timeshare project for which construction has not yet been completed and an effective registration has been obtained under this chapter.

2. An effective registration pursuant to this chapter is required for any party to offer to sell a timeshare interest reservation. Promoters offering a timeshare interest reservation under this section must provide the registered disclosure document required by RCW 64.36.140 to each prospective purchaser before he or she enters into a timeshare interest reservation. Prior to the signing of a purchase agreement, the subject property or properties must be completed, the timeshare offering registration required by RCW 64.36.020 must be amended to reflect any changes to the property and must be reapproved by the department, the disclosure document required by RCW 64.36.140 must be revised, and the new version of the disclosure document must be provided to the prospective purchaser.

3. Deposits accepted by promoters on a timeshare interest reservation may be no more than twenty percent of the total purchase price of the timeshare interest that is being purchased. Within one business day after being accepted by the promoter, any deposit on a timeshare interest reservation shall be deposited in an account in a federally insured depository located in the state of Washington. This account must be an escrow account wherein the deposited funds are held for the benefit of the purchaser. The department may request that deposits be placed in impoundment under RCW 64.36.130.

4. In addition to the cancellation rights provided in RCW 64.36.150, the purchaser has the right to cancel the purchase at any time before the signing of a purchase agreement. If the purchaser notifies the promoter that he or she wishes to cancel the timeshare interest reservation, the promoter must refund the full amount of the deposit minus any account fees within ten days of the notice.

5. If prior to signing a purchase agreement the purchaser learns that the promoter proposes to raise the purchase price above the price agreed to in the written reservation agreement for the timeshare interest reservation, the written reservation agreement is void and all deposit moneys including account fees shall be returned to the purchaser within ten days after the purchaser learns of the proposed price increase.

6. If the promoter charges account fees to pay for administrative costs of holding the purchaser's funds in escrow, these fees may be no more than one percent of the total deposit paid towards the timeshare interest reservation by the purchaser.

7. The promoter shall provide instructions to the escrow company for release of the funds to be held in escrow in compliance with this section and rules of the department.

8. The purchaser's right to cancel and the amount of the deposit proposed to be retained for account fees in the event of cancellation must be included in the contract for the sale of a timeshare interest reservation and the contract must state:

PURCHASER CANCELLATION RIGHTS

As a purchaser of a timeshare interest reservation, you have the right to cancel this timeshare interest reservation and receive a refund of all consideration paid (less only those account fee deductions which were fully disclosed at the time of the agreement) by providing written notice of the cancellation to the promoter or the promoter's agent at any time prior to signing a purchase agreement. You also have a right to cancel your purchase within seven days of signing a purchase agreement.

9. If it appears that the timeshare project will become or does become insolvent prior to completion, the promoter shall instruct the escrow company to immediately return all deposits to purchasers of timeshare interest reservations. If funds are returned under this subsection, the promoter may not retain any portion of the deposits for account fees.

## 64.36.028 - Timeshare interest—Incomplete projects or facilities—Promoter's obligations—Funds—Purchaser's rights.
1. An effective registration pursuant to this chapter is required for any party to offer to sell a timeshare interest. A promoter who offers to sell or sells revocable timeshare interests in incomplete projects or facilities is limited by and must comply with all of the requirements of RCW 64.36.025. If a promoter seeks to enter into irrevocable purchase agreements with purchasers for timeshare interests in incomplete projects or facilities, the promoter must meet the requirements in this section in addition to RCW 64.36.020 and the following limitations and conditions apply:

   a. The promoter is limited to offering or selling only fee simple deeded timeshare interests;

   b. Construction on the project must have begun by the time the irrevocable purchase agreement is signed and the purchaser must have the right to occupy the unit and use all contracted for amenities no later than within two years of the date that the irrevocable purchase agreement is signed;

   c. The promoter must establish an independent third-party escrow account for the purpose of protecting the funds or other property paid, pledged, or deposited by purchasers;

   d. The promoter's solicitations, advertisements, and promotional materials must clearly and conspicuously disclose that "THE PROJECT IS NOT YET COMPLETED; IT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION"; and

   e. The promoter's solicitations, advertisements, and promotional materials and the timeshare interest purchase agreement must clearly and conspicuously provide for and disclose the last possible estimated date for completion of construction of any building the promoter is contractually obligated to the purchaser to complete.

2. The timeshare interest purchase agreement must contain the following language in fourteen-point bold face type: "If the building in which the timeshare interest is located and all contracted for amenities are not completed by [estimated date of completion], the purchaser has the right to void the purchase agreement and is entitled to a full, unqualified refund of all moneys paid."

3. One hundred percent of all funds or other property that is received from or on behalf of purchasers of timeshare interests prior to the occurrence of events required in this section must be deposited pursuant to a third-party escrow agreement approved by the director. For purposes of this section, "purchasers" includes all persons solicited, offered, or who purchased a timeshare interest by a promoter within the state of Washington. An escrow agent shall maintain the account only in such a manner as to be under the direct supervision and control of the escrow agent. The escrow agent has a fiduciary duty to each purchaser to maintain the escrow accounts in accordance with good accounting practices and to release the purchaser's funds or other property from escrow only in accordance with this chapter. If the escrow agent receives conflicting demands for funds or property held in escrow, the escrow agent shall immediately notify the department of licensing of the dispute and the department shall determine if and how the funds should be distributed. If the purchaser, promoter, or escrow agent disagrees with the department's determination, the parties have the right to request an administrative hearing under chapter 34.05 RCW. Funds may be released from the escrow account to the purchaser if the purchaser cancels within the cancellation period, or to the promoter only when all three of the following conditions occur:

   a. The purchaser's cancellation period has expired;

   b. Closing has occurred; and

   c. Construction is complete and the building is ready to occupy.

4. In lieu of depositing purchaser funds into an escrow account, the promoter may post with the department a bond in an amount equal to or greater than the amount that would otherwise be required to be placed into the escrow account.

5. Any purchaser has the right to void the timeshare purchase agreement and request a full, unqualified refund if construction of the building in which the timeshare interest is located or all contracted for amenities are not completed within two years from the date that the irrevocable purchase agreement is signed or by the last estimated date of construction contained in the irrevocable purchase agreement, whichever is earlier.

6. If the completed timeshare building or contracted for amenities are materially and adversely different from the building or amenities that were promised to purchasers at the time that the purchase agreements were signed, the director may declare any or all of the purchaser contracts void. Before declaring the contracts void, the director shall give the promoter the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with chapters 34.05 and 18.235 RCW.

7. If the promoter intends to or does pledge or borrow against funds or properties, that are held in escrow or protected by a bond, to help finance in whole or in part the construction of the timeshare project or to help pay for operating costs, this must be fully, plainly, and conspicuously disclosed in all written advertising, in all written solicitations for the sale of the timeshare interests, in the registration with the director, and in the purchase agreement or contract.

8. A promoter who obtains an effective registration for a revocable timeshare interest reservation must meet the requirements of this section in order to complete an irrevocable purchase agreement.
