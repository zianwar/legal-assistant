## 64.55.010 - Definitions.
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in RCW 64.34.020 and in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Attached dwelling unit" means any dwelling unit that is attached to another dwelling unit by a wall, floor, or ceiling that separates heated living spaces. A garage is not a heated living space.

2. "Building enclosure" means that part of any building, above or below grade, that physically separates the outside or exterior environment from interior environments and which weatherproofs, waterproofs, or otherwise protects the building or its components from water or moisture intrusion. Interior environments consist of both heated and unheated enclosed spaces. The building enclosure includes, but is not limited to, that portion of roofs, walls, balcony support columns, decks, windows, doors, vents, and other penetrations through exterior walls, which waterproof, weatherproof, or otherwise protect the building or its components from water or moisture intrusion.

3. "Building enclosure design documents" means plans, details, and specifications for the building enclosure that have been stamped by a licensed engineer or architect. The building enclosure design documents shall include details and specifications that are appropriate for the building in the professional judgment of the architect or engineer which prepared the same to waterproof, weatherproof, and otherwise protect the building or its components from water or moisture intrusion, including details of flashing, intersections at roof, eaves or parapets, means of drainage, water-resistive membrane, and details around openings.

4. "Developer" means:

   a. With respect to a condominium or a conversion condominium, the declarant; and

   b. With respect to all other buildings, an individual, group of individuals, partnership, corporation, association, municipal corporation, state agency, or other entity or person that obtains a building permit for the construction or rehabilitative reconstruction of a multiunit residential building. If a permit is obtained by service providers such as architects, contractors, and consultants who obtain permits for others as part of services rendered for a fee, the person for whom the permit is obtained shall be the developer, not the service provider.

5. "Dwelling unit" has the meaning given to that phrase or similar phrases in the ordinances of the jurisdiction issuing the permit for construction of the building enclosure but if such ordinances do not provide a definition, then "dwelling unit" means a residence containing living, cooking, sleeping, and sanitary facilities.

6. "Multiunit residential building" means:

   a. A building containing more than two attached dwelling units, including a building containing nonresidential units if the building also contains more than two attached dwelling units, but excluding the following classes of buildings:

      i. Hotels and motels;

      ii. Dormitories;

      iii. Care facilities;

      iv. Floating homes;

      v. A building that contains attached dwelling units that are each located on a single platted lot, except as provided in (b) of this subsection;

      vi. A building in which all of the dwelling units are held under one ownership and is subject to a recorded irrevocable sale prohibition covenant.

   b. If the developer submits to the appropriate building department when applying for the building permit described in RCW 64.55.020 a statement that the developer elects to treat the improvement for which a permit is sought as a multiunit residential building for all purposes under this chapter, then "multiunit residential building" also means the following buildings for which such election has been made:

      i. A building containing only two attached dwelling units;

      ii. A building that does not contain attached dwelling units; and

      iii. Any building that contains attached dwelling units each of which is located on a single platted lot.

7. "Party unit owner" means a unit owner who is a named party to an action subject to this chapter and does not include any unit owners whose involvement with the action stems solely from their membership in the association.

8. "Qualified building inspector" means a person satisfying the requirements of RCW 64.55.040.

9. "Rehabilitative construction" means construction work on the building enclosure of a multiunit residential building if the cost of such construction work is more than five percent of the assessed value of the building.

10. "Sale prohibition covenant" means a recorded covenant that prohibits the sale or other disposition of individual dwelling units as or as part of a condominium for five years or more from the date of first occupancy except as otherwise provided in RCW 64.55.090, a certified copy of which the developer shall submit to the appropriate building department; provided such covenant shall not apply to sales or dispositions listed in RCW 64.34.400(2). The covenant must be recorded in the county in which the building is located and must be in substantially the following form:

This covenant has been recorded in the real property records of . . . . . . County, Washington, in satisfaction of the requirements of RCW 64.55.010 through 64.55.090. The undersigned is the owner of the property described on Exhibit A (the "Property"). Until termination of this covenant, no dwelling unit in or on the Property may be sold as a condominium unit except for sales listed in RCW 64.34.400(2).

This covenant terminates on the earlier of either: (a) Compliance with the requirements of RCW 64.55.090, as certified by the owner of the Property in a recorded supplement hereto; or (b) the fifth anniversary of the date of first occupancy of a dwelling unit as certified by the Owner in a recorded supplement hereto.

All title insurance companies and persons acquiring an interest in the Property may rely on the forgoing certifications without further inquiry in issuing any policy of title insurance or in acquiring an interest in the Property.

11. "Stamped" means bearing the stamp and signature of the responsible licensed architect or engineer on the title page, and on every sheet of the documents, drawings, or specifications, including modifications to the documents, drawings, and specifications that become part of change orders or addenda to alter those documents, drawings, or specifications.

\[ [2005 c 456 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1848.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20456%20§%202); \]

## 64.55.020 - Building permit application—Submission of design documents.
1. Any person applying for a building permit for construction of a multiunit residential building or rehabilitative construction shall submit building enclosure design documents to the appropriate building department prior to the start of construction or rehabilitative construction of the building enclosure. If construction work on a building enclosure is not rehabilitative construction because the cost thereof is not more than five percent of the assessed value of the building, then the person applying for a building permit shall submit to the building department a letter so certifying. Any changes to the building enclosure design documents that alter the manner in which the building or its components is waterproofed, weatherproofed, and otherwise protected from water or moisture intrusion shall be stamped by the architect or engineer and shall be provided to the building department and to the person conducting the course of construction inspection in a timely manner to permit such person to inspect for compliance therewith, and may be provided through individual updates, cumulative updates, or as-built updates.

2. The building department shall not issue a building permit for construction of the building enclosure of a multiunit residential building or for rehabilitative construction unless the building enclosure design documents contain a stamped statement by the person stamping the building enclosure design documents in substantially the following form: "The undersigned has provided building enclosure documents that in my professional judgment are appropriate to satisfy the requirements of RCW 64.55.005 through 64.55.090."

3. The building department is not charged with determining whether the building enclosure design documents are adequate or appropriate to satisfy the requirements of RCW 64.55.005 through 64.55.090. Nothing in RCW 64.55.005 through 64.55.090 requires a building department to review, approve, or disapprove enclosure design documents.

\[ [2005 c 456 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1848.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20456%20§%203); \]

The qualified inspector may, but is not required to, assist with the preparation of such design documents.

2. Nothing in this section alters requirements for licensure of any architect, engineer, or other professional, or alters the jurisdiction, authority, or scope of practice of architects, engineers, other professionals, or general contractors.

\[ [2021 c 260 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5024-S.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20260%20§%201); [2005 c 456 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1848.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20456%20§%205); \]

   b. An independent periodic review of the building enclosure during the course of construction or rehabilitative construction to ascertain whether the multiunit residential building has been constructed, or the rehabilitative construction has been performed, in substantial compliance with the building enclosure design documents.

2. Subsection (1)(a) of this section shall not apply to rehabilitative construction if the windows and adjacent cladding are not altered in the rehabilitative construction.

3. "Project" means one or more parcels of land in a single ownership, which are under development pursuant to a single land use approval or building permit, where window installation is performed by the owner with its own forces, or by the same general contractor, or, if the owner is contracting directly with trade contractors, is performed by the same trade contractor.

\[ [2005 c 456 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1848.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20456%20§%206); \]

The building department shall not issue a final certificate of occupancy or other equivalent final acceptance until the letter required by this section has been submitted. The building department is not charged with and has no responsibility for determining whether the building enclosure inspection is adequate or appropriate to satisfy the requirements of this chapter.

\[ [2005 c 456 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1848.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20456%20§%207); \]

## 64.55.080 - Inspector's report or testimony—No evidentiary presumption—Admissibility.
A qualified inspector's report or testimony regarding an inspection conducted pursuant to this chapter is not entitled to any evidentiary presumption in any arbitration or court proceeding. Nothing in this chapter restricts the admissibility of such a report or testimony, and questions of the admissibility of such a report or testimony shall be determined under the rules of evidence.

\[ [2005 c 456 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1848.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20456%20§%209); \]

## 64.55.090 - Sale of condominium unit subject to compliance—Inspection alternative.

   a. The inspection includes such intrusive or other testing, such as the removal of siding or other building enclosure materials, that the inspector believes, in his or her professional judgment, is necessary to ascertain the manner in which the building enclosure was constructed;

   b. The inspection evaluates, to the extent reasonably ascertainable and in the professional judgment of the inspector, the present condition of the building enclosure including whether such condition has adversely affected or will adversely affect the performance of the building enclosure to waterproof, weatherproof, or otherwise protect the building or its components from water or moisture intrusion. "Adversely affect" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 64.34.445(7);

   c. The inspection report includes recommendations for repairs to the building enclosure that, in the professional judgment of the qualified building inspector, are necessary to: (i) Repair a design or construction defect in the building enclosure that results in the failure of the building enclosure to perform its intended function and allows unintended water penetration not caused by flooding; and (ii) repair damage caused by such a defect that has an adverse effect as provided in RCW 64.34.445(7);

   d. With respect to a building that would be a multiunit residential building but for the recording of a sale prohibition covenant and unless more than five years have elapsed since the date such covenant was recorded, all repairs to the building enclosure recommended pursuant to (c) of this subsection have been made; and

   e. The declarant provides as part of the public offering statement, consistent with RCW 64.34.410 (1)(nn) and (2) and 64.34.415(1)(b), an inspection and repair report signed by the qualified building enclosure inspector that identifies:

      ii. The information obtained as a result of that inspection; and

      iii. The manner in which any repairs required by this section were performed, the scope of those repairs, and the names of the persons performing those repairs.

2. Failure to deliver the inspection and repair report in violation of this section constitutes a failure to deliver a public offering statement for purposes of chapter 64.34 RCW.

\[ [2005 c 456 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1848.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20456%20§%2010); \]

As used in this section, "adverse party" means the party who either directly asserted or defended claims against the appealing party. The demand shall identify the adverse party or parties and all claims between those parties shall be included in the trial de novo. The right to a trial de novo includes the right to a jury, if demanded. The court shall give priority to the trial date for the trial de novo.

5. If the judgment for damages, not including awards of fees and costs, in the trial de novo is not more favorable to the appealing party than the damages awarded by the arbitrator, not including awards of fees and costs, the appealing party shall pay the nonappealing adverse party's costs and fees incurred after the filing of the appeal, including reasonable attorneys' fees so incurred.

6. If the judgment for damages, not including awards of fees and costs, in the trial de novo is more favorable to the appealing party than the damages awarded by the arbitrator, not including awards of fees and costs, then the court may award costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred after the filing of the request for trial de novo in accordance with applicable law; provided if such a judgment is not more favorable to the appealing party than the most recent offer of judgment, if any, made pursuant to RCW 64.55.160, the court shall not make an award of fees and costs to the appealing party.

7. If a party is entitled to an award with respect to the same fees and costs pursuant to this section and RCW 64.55.160, then the party shall only receive an award of fees and costs as provided in and limited by RCW 64.55.160. Any award of fees and costs pursuant to subsections (5) or (6) of this section is subject to review in the event of any appeal thereof otherwise permitted by applicable law or court rule.

## 64.55.160 - Offers of judgment—Costs and fees.
1. On or before the sixtieth day following completion of the mediation pursuant to RCW 64.55.120(4), the declarant, association, or party unit owner may serve on an adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be entered. The offer of judgment shall specify the amount of damages, not including costs or fees, that the declarant, association, or party unit owner is offering to pay or receive. A declarant's offer shall also include its commitment to pay costs and fees that may be awarded as provided in this section. The declarant, association, or party unit owner may make more than one offer of judgment so long as each offer is timely made. Each subsequent offer supersedes and replaces the previous offer. Any offer not accepted within twenty-one days of the service of that offer is deemed rejected and withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible and may not be provided to the court or arbitrator except in a proceeding to determine costs and fees or as part of the motion identified in subsection (2) of this section.

2. A declarant's offer must include a demonstration of ability to pay damages, costs, and fees, including reasonable attorneys' fees, within thirty days of acceptance of the offer of judgment. The demonstration of ability to pay shall include a sworn statement signed by the declarant, the attorney representing the declarant, and, if any insurance proceeds will be used to fund any portion of the offer, an authorized representative of the insurance company. If the association or party unit owner disputes the adequacy of the declarant's demonstration of ability to pay, the association or party unit owner may file a motion with the court requesting a ruling on the adequacy of the declarant's demonstration of ability to pay. Upon filing of such motion, the deadline for a response to the offer shall be tolled from the date the motion is filed until the court has ruled.

3. An association or party unit owner that accepts the declarant's offer of judgment shall be deemed the prevailing party and, in addition to recovery of the amount of the offer, shall be entitled to a costs and fees award, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in an amount to be determined by the court in accordance with applicable law.

4. If the amount of the final nonappealable or nonappealed judgment, exclusive of costs or fees, is not more favorable to the offeree than the offer of judgment, then the offeror is deemed the prevailing party for purposes of this section only and is entitled to an award of costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred after the date the last offer of judgment was rejected and through the date of entry of a final nonappealable or nonappealed judgment, in an amount to be determined by the court in accordance with applicable law. The nonprevailing party shall not be entitled to receive any award of costs and fees.

5. If the final nonappealable or nonappealed judgment on damages, not including costs or fees, is more favorable to the offeree than the last offer of judgment, then the court shall determine which party is the prevailing party and shall determine the amount of the costs and fees award, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in accordance with applicable law.

6. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, with respect to claims brought by an association or unit owner, the liability for declarant's costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys' fees, shall:

   a. With respect to claims brought by an association, not exceed five percent of the assessed value of the condominium as a whole, which is determined by the aggregate tax-assessed value of all units at the time of the award; and

   b. With respect to claims brought by a party unit owner, not exceed five percent of the assessed value of the unit at the time of the award.
