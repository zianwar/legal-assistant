## 64.06.040 - After delivery of disclosure statement—Additional information—Seller's duty—Buyer's options—Closing the transaction.
1. If, after the date that a seller of real property completes a real property transfer disclosure statement, the seller learns from a source other than the buyer or others acting on the buyer's behalf such as an inspector of additional information or an adverse change which makes any of the disclosures made inaccurate, the seller shall amend the real property transfer disclosure statement, and deliver the amendment to the buyer. No amendment shall be required, however, if the seller takes whatever corrective action is necessary so that the accuracy of the disclosure is restored, or the adverse change is corrected, at least three business days prior to the closing date. Unless the corrective action is completed by the seller prior to the closing date, the buyer shall have the right to exercise one of the following two options: (a) Approving and accepting the amendment, or (b) rescinding the agreement of purchase and sale of the property within three business days after receiving the amended real property transfer disclosure statement. Acceptance or recision shall be subject to the same procedures described in RCW 64.06.030. If the closing date provided in the purchase and sale agreement is scheduled to occur within the three-business-day rescission period provided for in this section, the closing date shall be extended until the expiration of the three-business-day rescission period. The buyer shall have no right of rescission if the seller takes whatever action is necessary so that the accuracy of the disclosure is restored at least three business days prior to the closing date.

2. In the event any act, occurrence, or agreement arising or becoming known after the closing of a real property transfer causes a real property transfer disclosure statement to be inaccurate in any way, the seller of such property shall have no obligation to amend the disclosure statement, and the buyer shall not have the right to rescind the transaction under this chapter.

3. If the seller in a real property transfer fails or refuses to provide to the prospective buyer a real property transfer disclosure statement as required under this chapter, the prospective buyer's right of rescission under this section shall apply until the earlier of three business days after receipt of the real property transfer disclosure statement or the date the transfer has closed, unless the buyer has otherwise waived the right of rescission in writing. Closing is deemed to occur when the buyer has paid the purchase price, or down payment, and the conveyance document, including a deed or real estate contract, from the seller has been delivered and recorded. After closing, the seller's obligation to deliver the real property transfer disclosure statement and the buyer's rights and remedies under this chapter shall terminate.

4. Failure of a homeowners' association or its officers, directors, employees, or authorized agents to provide requested information in part 8 of the disclosure statement form in RCW 64.06.015 or part 6 of the disclosure statement form in RCW 64.06.020 does not constitute a seller's failure or refusal to provide a real property transfer disclosure statement under subsection (3) of this section.
