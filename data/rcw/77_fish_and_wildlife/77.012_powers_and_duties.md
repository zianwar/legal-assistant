## 77.12.203 - In lieu payments authorized—Procedure—Game lands defined.
1. Notwithstanding RCW 84.36.010 or other statutes to the contrary, the state treasurer, on behalf of the department, must distribute to counties by April 30th of each year on game lands, regardless of acreage, in each county, if requested by an election under RCW 77.12.201, an amount in lieu of real property taxes equal to that amount paid on similar parcels of open space land taxable under chapter 84.34 RCW or the greater of seventy cents per acre per year or the amount paid in 1984 plus an additional amount for control of noxious weeds equal to that which would be paid if such lands were privately owned. This amount may not be assessed or paid on department buildings, structures, facilities, game farms, fish hatcheries, water access sites, tidelands, or public fishing areas.

2. "Game lands," as used in this section and RCW 77.12.201, means those tracts, regardless of acreage, owned in fee by the department and used for wildlife habitat and public recreational purposes. All lands purchased for wildlife habitat, public access, or recreation purposes with federal funds in the Snake River drainage basin are considered game lands regardless of acreage.

3. This section does not apply to lands transferred after April 23, 1990, to the department from other state agencies.

4. The county must distribute the amount received under this section in lieu of real property taxes to all property taxing districts except the state in appropriate tax code areas the same way it would distribute local property taxes from private property. The county must distribute the amount received under this section for weed control to the appropriate weed district.

Migratory bird license validation and stamp funds may not be used on lands controlled by private hunting clubs or on private lands that charge a fee for public access. Migratory bird license validation and stamp funds may be used for migratory waterfowl projects on private land where public hunting is provided by written permission or on areas established by the department as waterfowl hunting closures.

3. All revenue derived from the sale of the license validation and stamp by the department to persons hunting solely nonwaterfowl migratory birds shall be deposited in the limited fish and wildlife account and shall be used only for that portion of the cost of printing and production of the stamps for nonwaterfowl migratory bird hunters as determined by subsection (4) of this section, and for those nonwaterfowl migratory bird projects specified by the director for the acquisition and development of nonwaterfowl migratory bird habitat in the state and for the enhancement, protection, and propagation of nonwaterfowl migratory birds in the state.

With regard to the revenue from license validation and stamp sales that is not the result of sales to stamp collectors, the department shall determine the proportion of migratory waterfowl hunters and solely nonwaterfowl migratory bird hunters by using the yearly migratory bird hunter harvest information program survey results or, in the event that these results are not available, other similar survey results. A two-year average of the most recent survey results shall be used to determine the proportion of the revenue attributed to migratory waterfowl hunters and the proportion attributed to solely nonwaterfowl migratory bird hunters for each fiscal year. For fiscal year 1998-99 and for fiscal year 1999-2000, ninety-six percent of the stamp revenue shall be attributed to migratory waterfowl hunters and four percent of the stamp revenue shall be attributed to solely nonwaterfowl migratory game hunters.

5. Acquisition shall include but not be limited to the acceptance of gifts of real estate or any interest therein or the rental, lease, or purchase of real estate or any interest therein. If the department acquires any fee interest, leasehold, or rental interest in real property under this section, it shall allow the general public reasonable access to that property and shall, if appropriate, ensure that the deed or other instrument creating the interest allows such access to the general public. If the department obtains a covenant in real property in its favor or an easement or any other interest in real property under this section, it shall exercise its best efforts to ensure that the deed or other instrument creating the interest grants to the general public in the form of a covenant running with the land reasonable access to the property. The private landowner from whom the department obtains such a covenant or easement shall retain the right of granting access to the lands by written permission, but may not charge a fee for access.

6. The department may produce *migratory bird stamps in any given year in excess of those necessary for sale in that year. The excess stamps may be sold to the public.
