## 77.65.010 - Required licenses—Exemption.
1. Except as otherwise provided by this title, a person must have a license issued by the director in order to engage in any of the following activities:

   a. Commercially fish for or take food fish or shellfish;

   b. Deliver from a commercial fishing vessel food fish or shellfish taken for commercial purposes in offshore waters. As used in this subsection, "deliver" means arrival at a place or port, and includes arrivals from offshore waters to waters within the state and arrivals from state or offshore waters;

   c. Operate a charter boat or commercial fishing vessel engaged in a fishery;

   d. Engage in wholesale buying, selling, dealing, processing, or brokering of raw or frozen fish or shellfish;

   e. Sell his or her commercially harvested catch of fish or shellfish to anyone other than a licensed wholesale fish buyer within or outside the state; or

   f. Act as a food fish guide or game fish guide for personal use, except that a charter boat license is required to operate a vessel from which a person may for a fee fish for food fish in state waters listed in RCW 77.65.150(4)(b).

2. No person may engage in the activities described in subsection (1) of this section unless the licenses required by this title are in the person's possession, and the person is the named license holder or an alternate operator designated on the license and the person's license is not suspended.

3. A valid Oregon license that is equivalent to a license under this title is valid in the concurrent waters of the Columbia river if the state of Oregon recognizes as valid the equivalent Washington license. The director may identify by rule what Oregon licenses are equivalent.

4. No license is required for the production or harvesting of private sector cultured aquatic products as defined in RCW 15.85.020 or for the delivery, processing, or wholesaling of such aquatic products. However, if a means of identifying such products is required by rules adopted under RCW 15.85.060, the exemption from licensing requirements established by this subsection applies only if the aquatic products are identified in conformance with those rules.

## 77.65.020 - Transfer of licenses—Restrictions—Fees—Inheritability.
1. Unless otherwise provided in this title, a license issued under this chapter is not transferable from the license holder to any other person. This may not be deemed to prohibit the granting or enforcement of a security interest in any such license.

2. The following restrictions apply to transfers of commercial fishery licenses, salmon delivery licenses, and salmon charter licenses that are transferable between license holders:

   a. The license holder shall surrender the previously issued license to the department.

   b. The department shall complete no more than one transfer of the license in any seven-day period.

   c. The fee to transfer a license from one license holder to another is:

      i. The same as the license renewal fee if the license is not limited under chapter 77.70 RCW;

      ii. Three and one-half times the renewal fee if the license is not a commercial salmon license and the license is limited under chapter 77.70 RCW;

      iii. Fifty dollars if the license is a commercial salmon license and is limited under chapter 77.70 RCW; or

      iv. Five hundred dollars if the license is a Dungeness crab-coastal fishery license.

   d. In addition to the fees under (c) of this subsection, an application fee of one hundred five dollars applies to all commercial license transfers.

3. A commercial license that is transferable under this title survives the death of the holder. Though such licenses are not personal property, they shall be treated as analogous to personal property for purposes of inheritance, intestacy, and enforcement of security interests pursuant to Title 62A RCW. Such licenses are subject to state laws governing wills, trusts, estates, intestate succession, and community property, except that such licenses are exempt from tax liens. The surviving spouse, estate, or beneficiary of the estate may apply for a renewal of the license. There is no fee for transfer of a license from a license holder to the license holder's surviving spouse or estate, or to a beneficiary of the estate.

4. Transfer of a license under this section is subject to the approval of the department according to any rules the department may adopt. Any transfer of a license issued under this chapter without the written consent of each person holding a security interest in the license is void.

A charter boat licensed in Oregon may fish without a Washington charter license under the same rules as Washington charter boat operators in ocean waters within the jurisdiction of Washington state from the southern border of the state of Washington to Leadbetter Point, as long as the Oregon vessel does not take on or discharge passengers for any purpose from any Washington port, the Washington shore, or a dock, landing, or other point in Washington. The provisions of this subsection shall be in effect as long as the state of Oregon has reciprocal laws and regulations.

6.

3. A salmon delivery license authorizes no taking of salmon or other fish or shellfish from the waters of the state.

4. If the director determines that the operation of a vessel under a salmon delivery license results in the depletion or destruction of the state's salmon resource or the delivery into this state of salmon products prohibited by law, the director may revoke the license under the procedures of chapter 34.05 RCW.

## 77.65.180 - Oregon, California harvested salmon—Landing in Washington ports encouraged.
1. The legislature finds that landing salmon into the ports of Washington state, regardless of where such salmon have been harvested, is economically beneficial to those ports as well as to the citizens of the state of Washington. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to encourage this practice.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 77.65.010(1)(b) and 77.65.170, a Washington citizen who holds a valid Oregon or California salmon troll license may land salmon taken during lawful seasons in Oregon and California into Washington ports without obtaining a salmon delivery license. This exception is valid only when the salmon were taken in offshore waters south of Cape Falcon.

3. The department shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section, including rules identifying the appropriate methods for verifying that salmon were in fact taken south of Cape Falcon.

As used in this section, "delivery" means arrival at a place or port, and include arrivals from offshore waters to waters within the state and arrivals ashore from offshore waters. The director shall not issue an emergency salmon delivery license unless, as determined by the director, a bona fide emergency exists.
