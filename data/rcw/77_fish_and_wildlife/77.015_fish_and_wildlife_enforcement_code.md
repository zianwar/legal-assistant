## 77.15.005 - Finding—Intent.
The legislature finds that merger of the departments of fisheries and wildlife resulted in two criminal codes applicable to fish and wildlife, and that it has become increasingly difficult to administer and enforce the two criminal codes. Furthermore, laws defining crimes involving fish and wildlife have evolved over many years of changing uses and management objectives for fish and wildlife. The resulting two codes make it difficult for citizens to comply with the law and unnecessarily complicate enforcement of laws against violators.

The legislature intends by chapter 190, Laws of 1998 to revise and recodify the criminal laws governing fish and wildlife, ensuring that all people involved with fish and wildlife are able to know and understand the requirements of the laws and the risks of violation. Additionally, the legislature intends to create a more uniform approach to criminal laws governing fish and wildlife and to the laws authorizing prosecution, sentencing, and punishments, including repealing crimes that are redundant to other provisions of the criminal code.

Chapter 190, Laws of 1998 is not intended to alter existing powers of the commission or the director to adopt rules or exercise powers over fish and wildlife. In some places reference is made to violation of department rules, but this is intended to conform with current powers of the commission, director, or both, to adopt rules governing fish and wildlife activities.

\[ [1998 c 190 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6328-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20190%20§%201); \]

## 77.15.010 - Exemption for department actions.
A person is not guilty of a crime under this chapter if the person is an officer, employee, or agent of the department lawfully acting in the course of his or her authorized duties.

\[ [1998 c 190 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6328-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20190%20§%202); \]

## 77.15.020 - Authority to define violation of rule as infraction—Agreement to enforce certain civil infractions.
1. If the commission or director has authority to adopt a rule that is punishable as a crime under this chapter, then the commission or director may provide that violation of the rule shall be punished with notice of infraction under RCW 7.84.030. Neither the commission nor the director have the authority to adopt a rule providing that a violation punishable as an infraction shall be a crime.

2. The director may, under the provisions of RCW 7.84.140, enter into an agreement allowing employees of the state parks and recreation commission and the department of natural resources to enforce certain civil infractions created under this title.

\[ [2011 c 320 § 17](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5622-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20320%20§%2017); [2005 c 321 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1128.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20321%20§%202); [1998 c 190 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6328-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20190%20§%203); \]

## 77.15.030 - Individual animal unlawfully taken—Separate offense.
Except as provided in RCW 77.15.260(2)(b), where it is unlawful to hunt, take, fish, possess, or traffic in big game or protected or endangered fish or wildlife, then each individual animal unlawfully taken or possessed is a separate offense.

\[ [2012 c 176 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6135-S.SL.pdf?cite=2012%20c%20176%20§%206); [1999 c 258 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5638-S.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%20258%20§%201); [1998 c 190 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6328-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20190%20§%204); \]

## 77.15.040 - Jurisdiction.

\[ [1998 c 190 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6328-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20190%20§%205); \]

## 77.15.050 - "Conviction" defined.
1. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, as used in this chapter, "conviction" means a final conviction in a state or municipal court.

2. A plea of guilty or a finding of guilt for a violation of this title or department rule constitutes a conviction regardless of whether the imposition of sentence is deferred or the penalty is suspended.

\[ [2012 c 176 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6135-S.SL.pdf?cite=2012%20c%20176%20§%207); [2009 c 333 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1778-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20333%20§%201); [1998 c 190 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6328-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20190%20§%206); \]

## 77.15.060 - Reference to chapters  7.84 and  9A.20 RCW.
Crimes defined by this chapter shall be punished as infractions, misdemeanors, gross misdemeanors, or felonies, based on the classification of crimes set out in chapters 7.84 and 9A.20 RCW.

\[ [1998 c 190 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6328-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20190%20§%207); \]

## 77.15.065 - Authority of attorney general if prosecuting attorney defaults.

## 77.15.070 - Civil forfeiture of property used for violation of chapter.
1. Fish and wildlife officers and ex officio fish and wildlife officers may seize without warrant boats, airplanes, vehicles, motorized implements, conveyances, gear, appliances, or other articles they have probable cause to believe have been held with intent to violate or used in violation of this title or rule of the commission or director. However, fish and wildlife officers or ex officio fish and wildlife officers may not seize any item or article, other than for evidence, if under the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the violation was inadvertent. The property seized is subject to forfeiture to the state under this section regardless of ownership. Property seized may be recovered by its owner by depositing with the department or into court a cash bond or equivalent security equal to the value of the seized property but not more than one hundred thousand dollars. Such cash bond or security is subject to forfeiture in lieu of the property. Forfeiture of property seized under this section is a civil forfeiture against property and is intended to be a remedial civil sanction.

2. In the event of a seizure of property under this section, jurisdiction to begin the forfeiture proceedings shall commence upon seizure. Within fifteen days following the seizure, the seizing authority shall serve a written notice of intent to forfeit property on the owner of the property seized and on any person having any known right or interest in the property seized. Notice may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule, including service by certified mail with return receipt requested. Service by mail is deemed complete upon mailing within the fifteen-day period following the seizure.

3. Persons claiming a right of ownership or right to possession of property are entitled to a hearing to contest forfeiture. Such a claim shall specify the claim of ownership or possession and shall be made in writing and served on the director within forty-five days of the seizure. If the seizing authority has complied with notice requirements and there is no claim made within forty-five days, then the property shall be forfeited to the state.

4. If any person timely serves the director with a claim to property, the person shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard as to the person's claim or right. The hearing shall be before the director or director's designee, or before an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW, except that a person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction if the aggregate value of the property seized is more than five thousand dollars. The department may settle a person's claim of ownership prior to the administrative hearing.

5. The hearing to contest forfeiture and any subsequent appeal shall be as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act. The seizing authority has the burden to demonstrate that it had reason to believe the property was held with intent to violate or was used in violation of this title or rule of the commission or director. The person contesting forfeiture has the burden of production and proof by a preponderance of evidence that the person owns or has a right to possess the property and:

   a. That the property was not held with intent to violate or used in violation of this title; or

   b. If the property is a boat, airplane, or vehicle, that the illegal use or planned illegal use of the boat, airplane, or vehicle occurred without the owner's knowledge or consent, and that the owner acted reasonably to prevent illegal uses of such boat, airplane, or vehicle.

6. A forfeiture of a conveyance encumbered by a perfected security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if the secured party neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act or omission. No security interest in seized property may be perfected after seizure.

7. If seized property is forfeited under this section the department may retain it for official use unless the property is required to be destroyed, or upon application by any law enforcement agency of the state, release such property to the agency for the use of enforcing this title, or sell such property, and deposit the proceeds to the fish and wildlife enforcement reward account created in RCW 77.15.425.

## 77.15.075 - Enforcement authority of fish and wildlife officers—Volunteer chaplain.
1. Fish and wildlife officers shall have and exercise, throughout the state, such police powers and duties as are vested in sheriffs and peace officers generally. Fish and wildlife officers are general authority Washington peace officers.

2. An applicant for a fish and wildlife officer position must be a citizen of the United States of America or a lawful permanent resident who can read and write the English language. Before a person may be appointed to act as a fish and wildlife officer, the person shall meet the minimum standards for employment with the department, including successful completion of a psychological examination and polygraph examination or similar assessment procedure administered in accordance with the requirements of RCW 43.101.095(2).

3. Any liability or claim of liability under chapter 4.92 RCW that arises out of the exercise or alleged exercise of authority by a fish and wildlife officer rests with the department unless the fish and wildlife officer acts under the direction and control of another agency or unless the liability is otherwise assumed under an agreement between the department and another agency.

4. The department may utilize the services of a volunteer chaplain as provided under chapter 41.22 RCW.

Based upon articulable facts that a person is engaged in fishing, harvesting, or hunting activities, fish and wildlife officers and ex officio fish and wildlife officers have the authority to temporarily stop the person and check for valid licenses, tags, permits, stamps, or catch record cards, and to inspect all fish, shellfish, seaweed, and wildlife in possession as well as the equipment being used to ensure compliance with the requirements of this title. Fish and wildlife officers and ex officio fish and wildlife officers also may request that the person write his or her signature for comparison with the signature on his or her fishing, harvesting, or hunting license. Failure to comply with the request is prima facie evidence that the person is not the person named on the license. Fish and wildlife officers and ex officio fish and wildlife officers may require the person, if age sixteen or older, to exhibit a driver's license or other photo identification.

## 77.15.100 - Seized fish, shellfish, wildlife, and covered animal species part or product—Forfeiture—Sale—Disposition of sale.
1. Fish, shellfish, and wildlife are property of the state under RCW 77.04.012. Fish and wildlife officers may sell seized, commercially taken or possessed fish and shellfish to a wholesale buyer and deposit the proceeds into the fish and wildlife enforcement reward account under RCW 77.15.425. Seized, recreationally taken or possessed fish, shellfish, and wildlife may be donated to nonprofit charitable organizations. The charitable organization must qualify for tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501(c)(3) of the federal internal revenue code. Seized fish, shellfish, and wildlife may be returned to the environment or otherwise safely disposed of if storage is not practical under the circumstances, after the evidentiary value of the seized fish, shellfish, or wildlife has been preserved through photographs, measurements, biological samples, or other reasonable means. If an exculpatory value is clearly apparent in the seized fish, shellfish, or wildlife, and the exculpatory value is not otherwise reasonably obtainable, the fish, shellfish, or wildlife should be retained.

2. Fish and wildlife officers may dispose of any covered animal species part or product seized through the enforcement of RCW 77.15.135 through a donation to a bona fide educational or scientific institution, solely for the purposes of raising awareness of the trafficking and threatened nature of endangered animals, as allowed under state, federal, and international law.

3. Unless otherwise provided in this title, fish, shellfish, wildlife, or any covered animal species part or product taken or possessed in violation of this title or department rule shall be forfeited to the state upon:

   a. Conviction as defined in RCW 77.15.050;

   b. A finding of guilt or plea of guilty pursuant to an amended information for any violation that was originally charged as a violation of this title or department rule regardless of whether the imposition of sentence is deferred or the penalty is suspended;

   c. Any infraction adjudicated under this title, department rule, or chapter 7.84 RCW with a final disposition of committed, paid, or uncontested, regardless of whether the violation was originally charged as a criminal offense and regardless of whether the penalty is suspended or deferred; or

   d. Any disposition of a case arising from an act originally charged as a violation of this title or department rule, or an infraction cited or referred as a violation of this title, department rule, or chapter 7.84 RCW, whereby the offender enters into a disposition that continues or defers the case for dismissal upon the successful completion of specific terms or conditions. For cases resulting in other types of dispositions that are not defined in RCW 77.15.050, including findings of not guilty, not committed, or dismissal with prejudice due to a failure of proof or violation of law, the fish, shellfish, wildlife, or covered animal species part or product may be returned, or its equivalent value paid, if the fish, shellfish, wildlife, or covered animal species part or product have already been donated or sold.

## 77.15.110 - Acting for commercial purposes—When—Proof.
1. For purposes of this chapter, a person acts for commercial purposes if the person engages in conduct that relates to commerce in fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife or any parts thereof. Commercial conduct may include taking, delivering, selling, buying, brokering, or trading fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife where there is present or future exchange of money, goods, or any valuable consideration. Evidence that a person acts for commercial purposes includes, but is not limited to, the following conduct:

   a. Using gear typical of that used in commercial fisheries;

   b. Exceeding the bag or possession limits for personal use by taking or possessing more than three times the amount of fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife allowed;

   c. Delivering or attempting to deliver fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife to a person who sells or resells it;

   d. Taking fish or shellfish using a vessel designated on a commercial fishery license or using gear not authorized in a personal use fishery;

   e. Using a commercial fishery license;

   f. Selling or dealing in raw furs for a fee or in exchange for goods or services;

   g. Performing taxidermy service on fish, shellfish, or wildlife belonging to another person for a fee or receipt of goods or services; or

   h. Packs, cuts, processes, or stores the meat of wildlife for consumption, for a fee or in exchange for goods or services.

2. For purposes of this chapter, the value of any fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife may be proved based on evidence of legal or illegal sales involving the person charged or any other person, of offers to sell or solicitation of offers to sell by the person charged or by any other person, or of any market price for the fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife including market price for farm-raised game animals. The value assigned to specific fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife by RCW 77.15.420 may be presumed to be the value of such fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife. It is not relevant to proof of value that the person charged misrepresented that the fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife was taken in compliance with law if the fish, seaweed, shellfish, or wildlife was unlawfully taken and had no lawful market value.
