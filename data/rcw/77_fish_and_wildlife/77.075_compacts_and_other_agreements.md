THE PACIFIC MARINE FISHERIES COMPACT

The contracting states do hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

The purposes of this compact are and shall be to promote the better utilization of fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, which are of mutual concern, and to develop a joint program of protection and prevention of physical waste of such fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting states jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction.

Nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to authorize the compacting states or any of them to limit the production of fish or fish products for the purpose of establishing or fixing the prices thereof or creating and perpetuating a monopoly.

ARTICLE II.

This agreement shall become operative immediately as to those states executing it whenever the compacting states have executed it in the form that is in accordance with the laws of the executing states and the congress has given its consent.

ARTICLE III.

Each state joining herein shall appoint, as determined by state statutes, one or more representatives to a commission hereby constituted and designated as The Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission, of whom one shall be the administrative or other officer of the agency of such state charged with the conservation of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains. This commission shall be a body with the powers and duties set forth herein.

The term of each commissioner of The Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission shall be four years. A commissioner shall hold office until his successor shall be appointed and qualified but such successor's term shall expire four years from legal date of expiration of the term of his predecessor. Vacancies occurring in the office of such commissioner from any reason or cause shall be filled for the unexpired term, or a commissioner may be removed from office, as provided by the statutes of the state concerned. Each commissioner may delegate in writing from time to time to a deputy the power to be present and participate, including voting as his representative or substitute, at any meeting of or hearing by or other proceeding of the commission.

Voting powers under this compact shall be limited to one vote for each state regardless of the number of representatives.

ARTICLE IV.

The duty of the said commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the conservation and the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell, and anadromous in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean over which the states signatory to this compact jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction. The commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions and said conservation zones to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the signatory parties hereto.

To that end the commission shall draft and, after consultation with the advisory committee hereinafter authorized, recommend to the governors and legislative branches of the various signatory states hereto legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell and anadromous fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the signatory states jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction. The commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislative branch in any state signatory hereto, present to the governor of such state its recommendations relating to enactments by the legislative branch of that state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.

The commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the signatory states with regard to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of such regulations as it deems advisable and which lie within the jurisdiction of such agencies.

The commission shall have power to recommend to the states signatory hereto the stocking of the waters of such states with marine, shell, or anadromous fish and fish eggs or joint stocking by some or all of such states and when two or more of the said states shall jointly stock waters the commission shall act as the coordinating agency for such stocking.

ARTICLE V.

The commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure, remove or discharge such officers and employees as may be required to carry the provisions of this compact into effect and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation. Said commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business. It may establish and maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place within the territorial limits of the signatory states but must meet at least once a year.

ARTICLE VI.

No action shall be taken by the commission except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states represented at any meeting. No recommendation shall be made by the commission in regard to any species of fish except by the vote of a majority of the compacting states which have an interest in such species.

ARTICLE VII.

The fisheries research agencies of the signatory states shall act in collaboration as the official research agency of The Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission.

An advisory committee to be representative of the commercial fishermen, commercial fishing industry and such other interests of each state as the commission deems advisable shall be established by the commission as soon as practicable for the purpose of advising the commission upon such recommendations as it may desire to make.

ARTICLE VIII.

Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any state or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any state imposing additional conditions and restrictions to conserve its fisheries.

ARTICLE IX.

Continued absence of representation or of any representative on the commission from any state party hereto, shall be brought to the attention of the governor thereof.

ARTICLE X.

The states agree to make available annual funds for the support of the commission on the following basis:

Eighty percent of the annual budget shall be shared equally by those member states having as a boundary the Pacific Ocean; not less than five percent of the annual budget shall be contributed by any other member state; the balance of the annual budget shall be shared by those member states, having as a boundary the Pacific Ocean, in proportion to the primary market value of the products of their commercial fisheries on the basis of the latest five-year catch records.

The annual contribution of each member state shall be figured to the nearest one hundred dollars.

This amended article shall become effective upon its enactment by the states of Alaska, California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and upon ratification by congress by virtue of the authority vested in it under Article I, section 10 of the Constitution of the United States.

ARTICLE XI.

This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each state until renounced by it. Renunciation of this compact must be preceded by sending six months' notice in writing of intention to withdraw from the compact to the other parties hereto.

ARTICLE XII.

The states of Alaska or Hawaii, or any state having rivers or streams tributary to the Pacific Ocean may become a contracting state by enactment of The Pacific Marine Fisheries Compact. Upon admission of any new state to the compact, the purposes of the compact and the duties of the commission shall extend to the development of joint programs for the conservation, protection and prevention of physical waste of fisheries in which the contracting states are mutually concerned and to all waters of the newly admitted state necessary to develop such programs.

This article shall become effective upon its enactment by the states of Alaska, California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and upon ratification by congress by virtue of the authority vested in it under Article I, section 10, of the Constitution of the United States.

## 77.75.070 - Wildlife violator compact—Established.
The wildlife violator compact is hereby established in the form substantially as follows, and the Washington state department of fish and wildlife is authorized to enter into such compact on behalf of the state with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein:

ARTICLE I

FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF

POLICY, AND PURPOSE

a. The party states find that:

1. Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.

2. The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.

3. The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources.

4. Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.

5. Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.

6. The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.

7. In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state:

   i. Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or

      ii. If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or

      iii. Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.

8. The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.

9. In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.

10. The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.

11. The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.

    b. It is the policy of the party states to:

1. Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.

2. Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state.

3. Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.

4. Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.

5. Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.

6. Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.

7. Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.

8. Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.

   c. The purpose of this compact is to:

1. Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.

2. Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.
