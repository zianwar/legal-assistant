\[ [2014 c 202 § 103](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6040-S.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%20202%20§%20103); \]

## 77.135.030 - Classification of species—Rules.
1. The department, in consultation with the invasive species council, may classify or reclassify and list by rule nonnative aquatic animal species as prohibited level 1, level 2, or level 3, based on the degree of invasive risk, the type of management action required, and resources available to conduct the management action.

   a. Species classified as prohibited level 1 pose a high invasive risk and are a priority for prevention and expedited rapid response management actions.

   b. Species classified as prohibited level 2 pose a high invasive risk and are a priority for long-term infested site management actions.

   c. Species classified as prohibited level 3 pose a moderate to high invasive risk and may be appropriate for prevention, rapid response, or other prohibited species management plan actions by the department, another agency, a local government, tribes, or the public.

2. The department, in consultation with the invasive species council, may classify and list by rule regulated type A species. This classification is used for nonnative aquatic animal species that pose a low to moderate invasive risk that can be managed based on intended use or geographic scope of introduction, have a beneficial use, and are a priority for department-led or department-approved management of the species' beneficial use and invasive risks.

3. Nonnative aquatic animal species not classified as prohibited level 1, level 2, or level 3 under subsection (1) of this section, or as regulated type A species under subsection (2) of this section, are automatically managed statewide as regulated type B species or regulated type C species and do not require listing by rule.

   a. Species managed as regulated type B pose a low or unknown invasive risk and are possessed for personal or commercial purposes, such as for aquariums, live food markets, or as nondomesticated pets.

   b. Species managed as regulated type C pose a low or unknown invasive risk and include all other species that do not meet the criteria for management as a regulated type B invasive species.

4. Classification of prohibited and regulated species:

   a. May be by individual species or larger taxonomic groups up to the family name;

   b. Must align, as practical and appropriate, with regional and national classification levels;

   c. Must be statewide unless otherwise designated by a water body, property, or other geographic region or area; and

   d. May define general possession and introduction conditions acceptable under department authorization, a permit, or as otherwise provided by rule.

5. Prior to or at the time of classifying species by rule as prohibited or regulated under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the department, in consultation with the invasive species council, must adopt rules establishing standards for determining invasive risk levels and criteria for determining beneficial use that take into consideration environmental impacts, and especially effects on the preservation of native species, salmon recovery, and threatened or endangered species.

\[ [2014 c 202 § 104](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6040-S.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%20202%20§%20104); \]

## 77.135.040 - Prohibited and regulated species—Required authorization.
1. Prohibited level 1, level 2, and level 3 species may not be possessed, introduced on or into a water body or property, or trafficked, without department authorization, a permit, or as otherwise provided by rule.

2. Regulated type A, type B, and type C species may not be introduced on or into a water body or property without department authorization, a permit, or as otherwise provided by rule.

3. Regulated type B species, when being actively used for commercial purposes, must be readily and clearly identified in writing by taxonomic species name or subspecies name to distinguish the subspecies from another prohibited species or a regulated type A species. Nothing in this section precludes using additional descriptive language or trade names to describe regulated type B species as long as the labeling requirements of this section are met.

\[ [2014 c 202 § 106](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6040-S.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%20202%20§%20106); \]

## 77.135.050 - Department-declared quarantine.
1. If the department determines it is necessary to protect the environmental, economic, or human health interests of the state from the threat of a prohibited level 1 or level 2 species, the department may declare a quarantine against a water body, property, or region within the state. The department may prohibit or condition the movement of aquatic conveyances and waters from such a quarantined place or area that are likely to contain a prohibited species.

2. A quarantine declaration under this section may be implemented separately or in conjunction with rapid response management actions under RCW 77.135.060 and infested site management actions under RCW 77.135.070 in a manner and for a duration necessary to protect the interests of the state from the threat of a prohibited level 1 or level 2 species. A quarantine declaration must include:

   a. The reasons for the action including the prohibited level 1 or level 2 species triggering the quarantine;

   b. The boundaries of the area affected;

   c. The action timeline;

   d. Types of aquatic conveyances and waters affected by the quarantine and any prohibition or conditions on the movement of those aquatic conveyances and waters from the quarantine area; and

   e. Inspection and decontamination requirements for aquatic conveyances.

## 77.135.060 - Rapid response management actions.
1. The department may implement rapid response management actions where a prohibited level 1 species is detected in or on a water body or property. Rapid response management actions may: Include expedited actions to contain, control, or eradicate the prohibited species; and, if applicable, be implemented in conjunction with a quarantine declaration. Rapid response management actions must be terminated by the department when it determines that the targeted prohibited level 1 species are:

   a. Eradicated;

   b. Contained or controlled without need for further management actions;

   c. Reclassified for that water body; or

   d. Being managed under infested site management actions pursuant to RCW 77.135.070.

2. If a rapid response management action exceeds seven days, the department may implement an incident command system for rapid response management including scope, duration, and types of actions and to support mutual assistance and cooperation between the department and other affected state and federal agencies, tribes, local governments, and private water body or property owners. The purpose of this system is to coordinate a rapid, effective, and efficient response to contain, control, and eradicate if feasible, a prohibited level 1 species. Mutual assistance and coordination by other state agencies is especially important to assist the department in expediting necessary state and federal environmental permits.

3. The department may enter into cooperative agreements with national, regional, state, and local rapid response management action partners to establish incident command system structures, secure or prepare submission-ready environmental permits, and identify mutual assistance commitments in preparation for potential future actions.

4. The department may perform simulated rapid response exercises, testing, or other training activities to prepare for future rapid response management actions.

5. In implementing rapid response management actions, the department may enter upon property consistent with the process established under RCW 77.135.170.

\[ [2014 c 202 § 108](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6040-S.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%20202%20§%20108); \]

## 77.135.070 - Infested site management actions.
1. The department may implement infested site management actions where a prohibited level 2 species is detected in or on a water body or property. Infested site management actions may: Include long-term actions to contain, control, or eradicate the prohibited species; and, if applicable, be implemented in conjunction with a quarantine declaration. Infested site management actions must be terminated by the department when it determines that the targeted prohibited level 2 species are:

   a. Eradicated;

   b. Contained or controlled without need for further management actions; or

   c. Reclassified for that water body.

2. The department must consult with affected state and federal agencies, tribes, local governments, and private water body or property owners prior to implementing infested site management actions. The purpose of the consultation is to support mutual assistance and cooperation in providing an effective and efficient response to contain, control, and eradicate, if feasible, a prohibited level 2 species.

3. The department may enter into cooperative agreements with national, regional, state, and local infested site management action partners to establish management responsibilities, secure or prepare submission-ready environmental permits, and identify mutual assistance commitments.

4. In implementing infested site management actions, the department may enter upon property consistent with the process established under RCW 77.135.170.

\[ [2014 c 202 § 109](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6040-S.SL.pdf?cite=2014%20c%20202%20§%20109); \]
