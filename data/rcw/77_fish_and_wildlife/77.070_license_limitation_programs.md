## 77.70.200 - Herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses—Number limited.
The legislature finds that the wise management of Washington state's herring resource is of paramount importance to the people of the state. The legislature finds that herring are an important part of the food chain for a number of the state's living marine resources. The legislature finds that both open and closed pond "spawn on kelp" harvesting techniques allow for an economic return to the state while at the same time providing for the proper management of the herring resource. The legislature finds that limitations on the number of herring harvesters tends to improve the management and economic health of the herring industry. The maximum number of herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses shall not exceed five annually. The state therefore must use its authority to regulate the number of herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses so that the management and economic health of the herring fishery may be improved.

The holder of a geoduck fishery license and the holder's agents and representatives shall comply with all applicable commercial diving safety regulations adopted by the federal occupational safety and health administration established under the federal occupational safety and health act of 1970 as such law exists on May 8, 1979, 84 Stat. 1590 et seq.; 29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq. A violation of those regulations is a violation of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, persons who dive for geoducks are "employees" as defined by the federal occupational safety and health act. A violation of this subsection is grounds for suspension or revocation of a geoduck fishery license following a hearing under the procedures of chapter 34.05 RCW. The director shall not suspend or revoke a geoduck fishery license if the violation has been corrected within ten days of the date the license holder receives written notice of the violation. If there is a substantial probability that a violation of the commercial diving standards could result in death or serious physical harm to a person engaged in harvesting geoduck clams, the director shall suspend the license immediately until the violation has been corrected. If the license holder is not the operator of the harvest vessel and has contracted with another person for the harvesting of geoducks, the director shall not suspend or revoke the license if the license holder terminates its business relationship with that person until compliance with this subsection is secured.

7. A person using a vessel in the geoduck fishery is required to apply for and obtain a vessel identification number from the department. The application fee for the vessel identification number is one hundred five dollars.

      ii. Change vessel designation if the hull length of the vessel proposed to be designated exceeds the hull length designated on the license on June 7, 2006, by more than ten feet. However, if such vessel designation is the result of an emergency transfer, the applicable vessel length would be the most recent permanent vessel designation on the license prior to June 7, 2006;

   b. If the hull length of the vessel proposed to be designated is comparable to or exceeds by up to one foot the hull length of the currently designated vessel, the department may change the vessel designation no more than once in any one-year period, measured from September 15th to September 15th of the following year, unless the currently designated vessel is lost or in disrepair such that it does not safely operate, in which case the department may allow a change in vessel designation;

   c. If the hull length of the vessel proposed to be designated exceeds by between one and ten feet the hull length of the designated vessel on June 7, 2006, the department may change the vessel designation no more than once on or after June 7, 2006, unless a request is made by the license holder during a Washington state coastal crab season for an emergency change in vessel designation. If such an emergency request is made, the director may allow a temporary change in designation to another vessel, if the hull length of the other vessel does not exceed by more than ten feet the hull length of the currently designated vessel.

2. For the purposes of this section, "hull length" means the length overall of a vessel's hull as shown by marine survey or by manufacturer's specifications.

3. By December 31, 2010, the department must, in cooperation with the coastal crab fishing industry, evaluate the effectiveness of this section and, if necessary, recommend any statutory changes to the appropriate committees of the senate and house of representatives.
