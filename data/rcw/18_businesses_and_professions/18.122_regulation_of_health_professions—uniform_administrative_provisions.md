## 18.122.010 - Legislative intent.
The legislature takes note of the burgeoning number of bills proposed to regulate new health and health-related professions and occupations. The legislature further recognizes the number of allied health professions seeking independent practice. Potentially at least one hundred forty-five discrete health professions and occupations are recognized nationally, with at least two hundred fifty secondary job classifications. A uniform and streamlined credentialing process needs to be established to permit the department of health to administer the health professional regulatory programs in the most cost-effective, accountable, and uniform manner. The public interest will be served by establishing uniform administrative provisions for the regulated professions under the jurisdiction of the department of health regulated after July 26, 1987.

   b. Certification, which is a voluntary process recognizing an individual who qualifies by examination and meets established educational prerequisites, and which protects the title of practice; and

   c. Licensure, which is the most restrictive and requires qualification by examination and educational prerequisites of a practitioner whose title is protected and whose scope of practice is restricted to only those licensed.

2. No person may practice or represent oneself as a practitioner of a health profession by use of any title or description of services without being registered to practice by the department of health, unless otherwise exempted by this chapter.

3. No person may represent oneself as certified or use any title or description of services without applying for certification, meeting the required qualifications, and being certified by the department of health, unless otherwise exempted by this chapter.

4. No person may represent oneself as licensed, use any title or description of services, or engage in any practice without applying for licensure, meeting the required qualifications, and being licensed by the department of health, unless otherwise exempted by this chapter.
