## 18.130.010 - Intent.
It is the intent of the legislature to strengthen and consolidate disciplinary and licensure procedures for the licensed health and health-related professions and businesses by providing a uniform disciplinary act with standardized procedures for the licensure of health care professionals and the enforcement of laws the purpose of which is to assure the public of the adequacy of professional competence and conduct in the healing arts.

It is also the intent of the legislature that all health and health-related professions newly credentialed by the state come under the Uniform Disciplinary Act.

Further, the legislature declares that the addition of public members on all health care commissions and boards can give both the state and the public, which it has a statutory responsibility to protect, assurances of accountability and confidence in the various practices of health care.

2. If a person fails to furnish a required report, the disciplining authority may petition the superior court of the county in which the person resides or is found, and the court shall issue to the person an order to furnish the required report.

The temporary permit may reflect statutory limitations on the scope of practice.

A license holder must be notified upon receipt of a complaint, except when the notification would impede an effective investigation. At the earliest point of time the license holder must be allowed to submit a written statement about that complaint, which statement must be included in the file. Complaints filed after July 27, 1997, are exempt from public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW until the complaint has been initially assessed and determined to warrant an investigation by the disciplining authority. Complaints determined not to warrant an investigation by the disciplining authority are no longer considered complaints, but must remain in the records and tracking system of the department. Information about complaints that did not warrant an investigation, including the existence of the complaint, may be released only upon receipt of a written public disclosure request or pursuant to an interagency agreement as provided in (b) of this subsection. Complaints determined to warrant no cause for action after investigation are subject to public disclosure, must include an explanation of the determination to close the complaint, and must remain in the records and tracking system of the department.

   b. The secretary, on behalf of the disciplining authorities, shall enter into interagency agreements for the exchange of records, which may include complaints filed but not yet assessed, with other state agencies if access to the records will assist those agencies in meeting their federal or state statutory responsibilities. Records obtained by state agencies under the interagency agreements are subject to the limitations on disclosure contained in (a) of this subsection.

2. The uniform procedures for conducting investigations shall provide that prior to taking a written statement:

## 18.130.135 - Suspension or restriction orders—Show cause hearing.
1. Upon an order of a disciplining authority to summarily suspend a license, or restrict or limit a license holder's practice pursuant to RCW 18.130.050 or 18.130.062, the license holder is entitled to a show cause hearing before a panel or the secretary as identified in subsection (2) of this section within fourteen days of requesting a show cause hearing. The license holder must request the show cause hearing within twenty days of the issuance of the order. At the show cause hearing, the disciplining authority has the burden of demonstrating that more probable than not, the license holder poses an immediate threat to the public health and safety. The license holder must request a hearing regarding the statement of charges in accordance with RCW 18.130.090.

2. [Empty]

   b. If the show cause hearing panel or secretary determines that the license holder poses an immediate threat to the public health and safety, the summary suspension or restriction order shall remain in effect. The show cause hearing panel or secretary may amend the order as long as the amended order ensures that the license holder will no longer pose an immediate threat to the public health and safety.

5. Within forty-five days of the show cause hearing panel's or secretary's determination to sustain the summary suspension or place restrictions on the license, the license holder may request a full hearing on the merits of the disciplining authority's decision to suspend or restrict the license.

## 18.130.150 - Reinstatement.
A person whose license has been suspended under this chapter may petition the disciplining authority for reinstatement after an interval as determined by the disciplining authority in the order unless the disciplining authority has found, pursuant to RCW 18.130.160, that the licensee can never be rehabilitated or can never regain the ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety. The disciplining authority shall hold hearings on the petition and may deny the petition or may order reinstatement and impose terms and conditions as provided in RCW 18.130.160 and issue an order of reinstatement. The disciplining authority may require successful completion of an examination as a condition of reinstatement.

A person whose license has been suspended for noncompliance with a support order or visitation order under RCW 74.20A.320 may petition for reinstatement at any time by providing the secretary a release issued by the department of social and health services stating that the person is in compliance with the order. If the person has continued to meet all other requirements for reinstatement during the suspension, the secretary shall automatically reissue the person's license upon receipt of the release, and payment of a reinstatement fee, if any.

## 18.130.160 - Finding of unprofessional conduct—Orders—Sanctions—Stay—Costs—Stipulations.
Upon a finding, after hearing, that a license holder has committed unprofessional conduct or is unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety due to a physical or mental condition, the disciplining authority shall issue an order including sanctions adopted in accordance with the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390 giving proper consideration to any prior findings of fact under RCW 18.130.110, any stipulations to informal disposition under RCW 18.130.172, and any action taken by other in-state or out-of-state disciplining authorities. The order must provide for one or any combination of the following, as directed by the schedule, except as provided in RCW 9.97.020:

1. Revocation of the license;

2. Suspension of the license for a fixed or indefinite term;

3. Restriction or limitation of the practice;

4. Requiring the satisfactory completion of a specific program of remedial education or treatment;

5. The monitoring of the practice by a supervisor approved by the disciplining authority;

6. Censure or reprimand;

7. Compliance with conditions of probation for a designated period of time;

8. Payment of a fine for each violation of this chapter, not to exceed five thousand dollars per violation. Funds received shall be placed in the health professions account;

9. Denial of the license request;

10. Corrective action;

11. Refund of fees billed to and collected from the consumer;

12. A surrender of the practitioner's license in lieu of other sanctions, which must be reported to the federal data bank.

Any of the actions under this section may be totally or partly stayed by the disciplining authority. Safeguarding the public's health and safety is the paramount responsibility of every disciplining authority. In determining what action is appropriate, the disciplining authority must consider the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390. Where the schedule allows flexibility in determining the appropriate sanction, the disciplining authority must first consider what sanctions are necessary to protect or compensate the public. Only after such provisions have been made may the disciplining authority consider and include in the order requirements designed to rehabilitate the license holder. All costs associated with compliance with orders issued under this section are the obligation of the license holder. The disciplining authority may order permanent revocation of a license if it finds that the license holder can never be rehabilitated or can never regain the ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety.

Surrender or permanent revocation of a license under this section is not subject to a petition for reinstatement under RCW 18.130.150.

The disciplining authority may determine that a case presents unique circumstances that the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390 does not adequately address. The disciplining authority may deviate from the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390 when selecting appropriate sanctions, but the disciplining authority must issue a written explanation of the basis for not following the schedule.

The license holder may enter into a stipulated disposition of charges that includes one or more of the sanctions of this section, but only after a statement of charges has been issued and the license holder has been afforded the opportunity for a hearing and has elected on the record to forego such a hearing. The stipulation shall either contain one or more specific findings of unprofessional conduct or inability to practice, or a statement by the license holder acknowledging that evidence is sufficient to justify one or more specified findings of unprofessional conduct or inability to practice. The stipulation entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be considered formal disciplinary action for all purposes.

## 18.130.165 - Enforcement of fine.
Where an order for payment of a fine is made as a result of a citation under RCW 18.130.230 or a hearing under RCW 18.130.100 or 18.130.190 and timely payment is not made as directed in the final order, the disciplining authority may enforce the order for payment in the superior court in the county in which the hearing was held. This right of enforcement shall be in addition to any other rights the disciplining authority may have as to any licensee ordered to pay a fine but shall not be construed to limit a licensee's ability to seek judicial review under RCW 18.130.140.

In any action for enforcement of an order of payment of a fine, the disciplining authority's order is conclusive proof of the validity of the order of payment of a fine and the terms of payment.

## 18.130.170 - Capacity of license holder to practice—Hearing—Mental or physical examination—Implied consent.
1. If the disciplining authority believes a license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety to consumers by reason of any mental or physical condition, a statement of charges in the name of the disciplining authority shall be served on the license holder and notice shall also be issued providing an opportunity for a hearing. The hearing shall be limited to the sole issue of the capacity of the license holder to practice with reasonable skill and safety. If the disciplining authority determines that the license holder is unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety for one of the reasons stated in this subsection, the disciplining authority shall impose such sanctions under RCW 18.130.160 as is deemed necessary to protect the public.

2. [Empty]

   a. In investigating or adjudicating a complaint or report that a license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety by reason of any mental or physical condition, the disciplining authority may require a license holder to submit to a mental or physical examination by one or more licensed or certified health professionals designated by the disciplining authority. The license holder shall be provided written notice of the disciplining authority's intent to order a mental or physical examination, which notice shall include: (i) A statement of the specific conduct, event, or circumstances justifying an examination; (ii) a summary of the evidence supporting the disciplining authority's concern that the license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety by reason of a mental or physical condition, and the grounds for believing such evidence to be credible and reliable; (iii) a statement of the nature, purpose, scope, and content of the intended examination; (iv) a statement that the license holder has the right to respond in writing within twenty days to challenge the disciplining authority's grounds for ordering an examination or to challenge the manner or form of the examination; and (v) a statement that if the license holder timely responds to the notice of intent, then the license holder will not be required to submit to the examination while the response is under consideration.

   b. Upon submission of a timely response to the notice of intent to order a mental or physical examination, the license holder shall have an opportunity to respond to or refute such an order by submission of evidence or written argument or both. The evidence and written argument supporting and opposing the mental or physical examination shall be reviewed by either a panel of the disciplining authority members who have not been involved with the allegations against the license holder or a neutral decision maker approved by the disciplining authority. The reviewing panel of the disciplining authority or the approved neutral decision maker may, in its discretion, ask for oral argument from the parties. The reviewing panel of the disciplining authority or the approved neutral decision maker shall prepare a written decision as to whether: There is reasonable cause to believe that the license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety by reason of a mental or physical condition, or the manner or form of the mental or physical examination is appropriate, or both.

   c. Upon receipt by the disciplining authority of the written decision, or upon the failure of the license holder to timely respond to the notice of intent, the disciplining authority may issue an order requiring the license holder to undergo a mental or physical examination. All such mental or physical examinations shall be narrowly tailored to address only the alleged mental or physical condition and the ability of the license holder to practice with reasonable skill and safety. An order of the disciplining authority requiring the license holder to undergo a mental or physical examination is not a final order for purposes of appeal. The cost of the examinations ordered by the disciplining authority shall be paid out of the health professions account. In addition to any examinations ordered by the disciplining authority, the license holder may submit physical or mental examination reports from licensed or certified health professionals of the license holder's choosing and expense.

   d. If the disciplining authority finds that a license holder has failed to submit to a properly ordered mental or physical examination, then the disciplining authority may order appropriate action or discipline under RCW 18.130.180(9), unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's control. However, no such action or discipline may be imposed unless the license holder has had the notice and opportunity to challenge the disciplining authority's grounds for ordering the examination, to challenge the manner and form, to assert any other defenses, and to have such challenges or defenses considered by either a panel of the disciplining authority members who have not been involved with the allegations against the license holder or a neutral decision maker approved by the disciplining authority, as previously set forth in this section. Further, the action or discipline ordered by the disciplining authority shall not be more severe than a suspension of the license, certification, registration, or application until such time as the license holder complies with the properly ordered mental or physical examination.

   e. Nothing in this section shall restrict the power of a disciplining authority to act in an emergency under RCW 34.05.422(4), 34.05.479, and 18.130.050(8).

   f. A determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that a license holder is mentally incompetent or an individual with mental illness is presumptive evidence of the license holder's inability to practice with reasonable skill and safety. An individual affected under this section shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity, at his or her expense, to demonstrate that the individual can resume competent practice with reasonable skill and safety to the consumer.

3. For the purpose of subsection (2) of this section, a license holder governed by this chapter, by making application, practicing, or filing a license renewal, is deemed to have given consent to submit to a mental, physical, or psychological examination when directed in writing by the disciplining authority and further to have waived all objections to the admissibility or use of the examining health professional's testimony or examination reports by the disciplining authority on the ground that the testimony or reports constitute privileged communications.

## 18.130.172 - Evidence summary and stipulations.
1. Prior to serving a statement of charges under RCW 18.130.090 or 18.130.170, the disciplinary [disciplining] authority may furnish a statement of allegations to the licensee along with a detailed summary of the evidence relied upon to establish the allegations and a proposed stipulation for informal resolution of the allegations. These documents shall be exempt from public disclosure until such time as the allegations are resolved either by stipulation or otherwise.

2. The disciplinary [disciplining] authority and the licensee may stipulate that the allegations may be disposed of informally in accordance with this subsection. The stipulation shall contain a statement of the facts leading to the filing of the complaint; the act or acts of unprofessional conduct alleged to have been committed or the alleged basis for determining that the licensee is unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety; a statement that the stipulation is not to be construed as a finding of either unprofessional conduct or inability to practice; an acknowledgment that a finding of unprofessional conduct or inability to practice, if proven, constitutes grounds for discipline under this chapter; and an agreement on the part of the licensee that the sanctions set forth in RCW 18.130.160, except RCW 18.130.160 (1), (2), (6), and (8), may be imposed as part of the stipulation, except that no fine may be imposed but the licensee may agree to reimburse the disciplinary [disciplining] authority the costs of investigation and processing the complaint up to an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars per allegation; and an agreement on the part of the disciplinary [disciplining] authority to forego further disciplinary proceedings concerning the allegations. A stipulation entered into pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered formal disciplinary action.

3. If the licensee declines to agree to disposition of the charges by means of a stipulation pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the disciplinary [disciplining] authority may proceed to formal disciplinary action pursuant to RCW 18.130.090 or 18.130.170.

4. Upon execution of a stipulation under subsection (2) of this section by both the licensee and the disciplinary [disciplining] authority, the complaint is deemed disposed of and shall become subject to public disclosure on the same basis and to the same extent as other records of the disciplinary [disciplining] authority. Should the licensee fail to pay any agreed reimbursement within thirty days of the date specified in the stipulation for payment, the disciplinary [disciplining] authority may seek collection of the amount agreed to be paid in the same manner as enforcement of a fine under RCW 18.130.165.

## 18.130.175 - Physician health and voluntary substance use disorder monitoring programs.
1. In lieu of disciplinary action under RCW 18.130.160 and if the disciplining authority determines that the unprofessional conduct may be the result of an applicable impairing or potentially impairing health condition, the disciplining authority may refer the license holder to a physician health program or a voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program approved by the disciplining authority.

The cost of evaluation and treatment shall be the responsibility of the license holder, but the responsibility does not preclude payment by an employer, existing insurance coverage, or other sources. Evaluation and treatment shall be provided by providers approved by the entity or the commission. The disciplining authority may also approve the use of out-of-state programs. Referral of the license holder to the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program shall be done only with the consent of the license holder. Referral to the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program may also include probationary conditions for a designated period of time. If the license holder does not consent to be referred to the program or does not successfully complete the program, the disciplining authority may take appropriate action under RCW 18.130.160 which includes suspension of the license unless or until the disciplining authority, in consultation with the director of the applicable program, determines the license holder is able to practice safely. The secretary shall adopt uniform rules for the evaluation by the disciplining authority of return to substance use or program violation on the part of a license holder in the program. The evaluation shall encourage program participation with additional conditions, in lieu of disciplinary action, when the disciplining authority determines that the license holder is able to continue to practice with reasonable skill and safety.

2. In addition to approving the physician health program or the voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program that may receive referrals from the disciplining authority, the disciplining authority may establish by rule requirements for participation of license holders who are not being investigated or monitored by the disciplining authority. License holders voluntarily participating in the approved programs without being referred by the disciplining authority shall not be subject to disciplinary action under RCW 18.130.160 for their impairing or potentially impairing health condition, and shall not have their participation made known to the disciplining authority, if they meet the requirements of this section and the program in which they are participating.

3. The license holder shall sign a waiver allowing the program to release information to the disciplining authority if the licensee does not comply with the requirements of this section or is unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety. The physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder program shall report to the disciplining authority any license holder who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or the program or who, in the opinion of the program, is unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety. License holders shall report to the disciplining authority if they fail to comply with this section or do not complete the program's requirements. License holders may, upon the agreement of the program and disciplining authority, reenter the program if they have previously failed to comply with this section.

4. Program records including, but not limited to, case notes, progress notes, laboratory reports, evaluation and treatment records, electronic and written correspondence within the program, and between the program and the participant or other involved entities including, but not limited to, employers, credentialing bodies, referents, or other collateral sources, relating to license holders referred to or voluntarily participating in approved programs are confidential and exempt from disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW and shall not be subject to discovery by subpoena or admissible as evidence except:

   a. To defend any civil action by a license holder regarding the restriction or revocation of that individual's clinical or staff privileges, or termination of a license holder's employment. In such an action, the program will, upon subpoena issued by either party to the action, and upon the requesting party seeking a protective order for the requested disclosure, provide to both parties of the action written disclosure that includes the following information:

      i. Verification of a health care professional's participation in the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program as it relates to aspects of program involvement at issue in the civil action;

      ii. The dates of participation;

      iii. Whether or not the program identified an impairing or potentially impairing health condition;

      iv. Whether the health care professional was compliant with the requirements of the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program; and

      v. Whether the health care professional successfully completed the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program; and

   b. Records provided to the disciplining authority for cause as described in subsection (3) of this section. Program records relating to license holders mandated to the program, through order or by stipulation, by the disciplining authority or relating to license holders reported to the disciplining authority by the program for cause, must be released to the disciplining authority at the request of the disciplining authority. Records held by the disciplining authority under this section are exempt from chapter 42.56 RCW and are not subject to discovery by subpoena except by the license holder.

5. This section does not affect an employer's right or ability to make employment-related decisions regarding a license holder. This section does not restrict the authority of the disciplining authority to take disciplinary action for any other unprofessional conduct.

6. A person who, in good faith, reports information or takes action in connection with this section is immune from civil liability for reporting information or taking the action.

   a. The immunity from civil liability provided by this section shall be liberally construed to accomplish the purposes of this section, and applies to both license holders and students and trainees when students and trainees of the applicable professions are served by the program. The persons entitled to immunity shall include:

      i. An approved physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program;

      ii. The professional association affiliated with the program;

      iii. Members, employees, or agents of the program or associations;

      iv. Persons reporting a license holder as being possibly impaired or providing information about the license holder's impairment; and

      v. Professionals supervising or monitoring the course of the program participant's treatment or rehabilitation.

   b. The courts are strongly encouraged to impose sanctions on program participants and their attorneys whose allegations under this subsection are not made in good faith and are without either reasonable objective, substantive grounds, or both.

   c. The immunity provided in this section is in addition to any other immunity provided by law.

7. In the case of a person who is applying to be a substance use disorder professional or substance use disorder professional trainee certified under chapter 18.205 RCW, if the person is:

   a. Less than one year in recovery from a substance use disorder, the duration of time that the person may be required to participate in an approved substance use disorder monitoring program may not exceed the amount of time necessary for the person to achieve one year in recovery; or

   b. At least one year in recovery from a substance use disorder, the person may not be required to participate in the approved substance use disorder monitoring program.

8. In the case of a person who is applying to be an agency affiliated counselor registered under chapter 18.19 RCW and practices or intends to practice as a peer counselor in an agency, as defined in RCW 18.19.020, if the person is:

   a. Less than one year in recovery from a substance use disorder, the duration of time that the person may be required to participate in the approved substance use disorder monitoring program may not exceed the amount of time necessary for the person to achieve one year in recovery; or

   b. At least one year in recovery from a substance use disorder, the person may not be required to participate in the approved substance use disorder monitoring program.

## 18.130.180 - Unprofessional conduct.
The following conduct, acts, or conditions constitute unprofessional conduct for any license holder under the jurisdiction of this chapter:

1. The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. If the act constitutes a crime, conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to disciplinary action. Upon such a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based. For the purposes of this section, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for the conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

2. Misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact in obtaining a license or in reinstatement thereof;

3. All advertising which is false, fraudulent, or misleading;

4. Incompetence, negligence, or malpractice which results in injury to a patient or which creates an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed. The use of a nontraditional treatment by itself shall not constitute unprofessional conduct, provided that it does not result in injury to a patient or create an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed;

5. Suspension, revocation, or restriction of the individual's license to practice any health care profession by competent authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, a certified copy of the order, stipulation, or agreement being conclusive evidence of the revocation, suspension, or restriction;

6. Except when authorized by *RCW 18.130.345, the possession, use, prescription for use, or distribution of controlled substances or legend drugs in any way other than for legitimate or therapeutic purposes, diversion of controlled substances or legend drugs, the violation of any drug law, or prescribing controlled substances for oneself;

7. Violation of any state or federal statute or administrative rule regulating the profession in question, including any statute or rule defining or establishing standards of patient care or professional conduct or practice;

8. Failure to cooperate with the disciplining authority by:

   a. Not furnishing any papers, documents, records, or other items;

   b. Not furnishing in writing a full and complete explanation covering the matter contained in the complaint filed with the disciplining authority;

   c. Not responding to subpoenas issued by the disciplining authority, whether or not the recipient of the subpoena is the accused in the proceeding; or

   d. Not providing reasonable and timely access for authorized representatives of the disciplining authority seeking to perform practice reviews at facilities utilized by the license holder;

9. Failure to comply with an order issued by the disciplining authority or a stipulation for informal disposition entered into with the disciplining authority;

10. Aiding or abetting an unlicensed person to practice when a license is required;

11. Violations of rules established by any health agency;

12. Practice beyond the scope of practice as defined by law or rule;

13. Misrepresentation or fraud in any aspect of the conduct of the business or profession;

14. Failure to adequately supervise auxiliary staff to the extent that the consumer's health or safety is at risk;

15. Engaging in a profession involving contact with the public while suffering from a contagious or infectious disease involving serious risk to public health;

16. Promotion for personal gain of any unnecessary or inefficacious drug, device, treatment, procedure, or service;

17. Conviction of any gross misdemeanor or felony relating to the practice of the person's profession. For the purposes of this subsection, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

18. The procuring, or aiding or abetting in procuring, a criminal abortion;

19. The offering, undertaking, or agreeing to cure or treat disease by a secret method, procedure, treatment, or medicine, or the treating, operating, or prescribing for any health condition by a method, means, or procedure which the licensee refuses to divulge upon demand of the disciplining authority;

20. The willful betrayal of a practitioner-patient privilege as recognized by law;

21. Violation of chapter 19.68 RCW or a pattern of violations of RCW 41.05.700(8), 48.43.735(8), 48.49.020, 48.49.030, 71.24.335(8), or 74.09.325(8);

22. Interference with an investigation or disciplinary proceeding by willful misrepresentation of facts before the disciplining authority or its authorized representative, or by the use of threats or harassment against any patient or witness to prevent them from providing evidence in a disciplinary proceeding or any other legal action, or by the use of financial inducements to any patient or witness to prevent or attempt to prevent him or her from providing evidence in a disciplinary proceeding;

23. Current misuse of:

    a. Alcohol;

    b. Controlled substances; or

    c. Legend drugs;

24. Abuse of a client or patient or sexual contact with a client or patient;

25. Acceptance of more than a nominal gratuity, hospitality, or subsidy offered by a representative or vendor of medical or health-related products or services intended for patients, in contemplation of a sale or for use in research publishable in professional journals, where a conflict of interest is presented, as defined by rules of the disciplining authority, in consultation with the department, based on recognized professional ethical standards;

26. Violation of RCW 18.130.420;

27. Performing conversion therapy on a patient under age eighteen;

28. Violation of RCW 18.130.430.

## 18.130.190 - Practice without license—Investigation of complaints—Cease and desist orders—Injunctions—Penalties.
1. The secretary shall investigate complaints concerning practice by unlicensed persons of a profession or business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040. In the investigation of the complaints, the secretary shall have the same authority as provided the secretary under RCW 18.130.050.

2. The secretary may issue a notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order to any person whom the secretary has reason to believe is engaged in the unlicensed practice of a profession or business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040. The person to whom such notice is issued may request an adjudicative proceeding to contest the charges. The request for hearing must be filed within twenty days after service of the notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order. The failure to request a hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the secretary may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine. All proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

3. If the secretary makes a final determination that a person has engaged or is engaging in unlicensed practice, the secretary may issue a cease and desist order. In addition, the secretary may impose a civil fine in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars for each day upon which the person engaged in unlicensed practice of a business or profession for which a license is required by one or more of the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040. The proceeds of such fines shall be deposited to the health professions account.

4. If the secretary makes a written finding of fact that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order, the secretary may issue a temporary cease and desist order. The person receiving a temporary cease and desist order shall be provided an opportunity for a prompt hearing. The temporary cease and desist order shall remain in effect until further order of the secretary. The failure to request a prompt or regularly scheduled hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the secretary may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine.

5. Neither the issuance of a cease and desist order nor payment of a civil fine shall relieve the person so practicing or operating a business without a license from criminal prosecution therefor, but the remedy of a cease and desist order or civil fine shall be in addition to any criminal liability. The cease and desist order is conclusive proof of unlicensed practice and may be enforced under RCW 7.21.060. This method of enforcement of the cease and desist order or civil fine may be used in addition to, or as an alternative to, any provisions for enforcement of agency orders set out in chapter 34.05 RCW.

6. The attorney general, a county prosecuting attorney, the secretary, a board, or any person may in accordance with the laws of this state governing injunctions, maintain an action in the name of this state to enjoin any person practicing a profession or business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040 without a license from engaging in such practice or operating such business until the required license is secured. However, the injunction shall not relieve the person so practicing or operating a business without a license from criminal prosecution therefor, but the remedy by injunction shall be in addition to any criminal liability.

7. [Empty]

   a. Unlicensed practice of a profession or operating a business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040, unless otherwise exempted by law, constitutes a gross misdemeanor for a single violation.
