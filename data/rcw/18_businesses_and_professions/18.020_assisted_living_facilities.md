## 18.20.010 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the development, establishment, and enforcement of standards for the maintenance and operation of assisted living facilities, which, in the light of advancing knowledge, will promote safe and adequate care of the individuals therein. It is further the intent of the legislature that assisted living facilities be available to meet the needs of those for whom they care by recognizing the capabilities of individuals to direct their self-medication or to use supervised self-medication techniques when ordered and approved by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW or a podiatric physician and surgeon licensed under chapter 18.22 RCW.

The legislature finds that many residents of community-based long-term care facilities are vulnerable and their health and well-being are dependent on their caregivers. The quality, skills, and knowledge of their caregivers are often the key to good care. The legislature finds that the need for well-trained caregivers is growing as the state's population ages and residents' needs increase. The legislature intends that current training standards be enhanced.

1. [Empty]

   a. Upon receipt of an application for license, if the applicant and the facilities of the assisted living facility meet the requirements established under this chapter, the department may issue a license. If there is a failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter, the department may in its discretion issue a provisional license to an applicant for a license or for the renewal of a license. A provisional license permits the operation of the assisted living facility for a period to be determined by the department, but not to exceed twelve months and is not subject to renewal. The department may also place conditions on the license under RCW 18.20.190.

   b. At the time of the application for or renewal of a license or provisional license, the licensee shall pay a license fee. Beginning July 1, 2011, and thereafter, the per bed license fee must be established in the omnibus appropriations act and any amendment or additions made to that act. The license fees established in the omnibus appropriations act and any amendment or additions made to that act may not exceed the department's annual licensing and oversight activity costs and must include the department's cost of paying providers for the amount of the license fee attributed to medicaid clients.

   c. A license issued under this chapter may not exceed twelve months in duration and expires on a date set by the department. An assisted living facility license must be issued only to the person that applied for the license. All applications for renewal of a license shall be made not later than thirty days prior to the date of expiration of the license. Each license shall be issued only for the premises and persons named in the application, and no license shall be transferable or assignable. Licenses shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.

2. A licensee who receives notification of the department's initiation of a denial, suspension, nonrenewal, or revocation of an assisted living facility license may, in lieu of appealing the department's action, surrender or relinquish the license. The department shall not issue a new license to or contract with the licensee, for the purposes of providing care to vulnerable adults or children, for a period of twenty years following the surrendering or relinquishment of the former license. The licensing record shall indicate that the licensee relinquished or surrendered the license, without admitting the violations, after receiving notice of the department's initiation of a denial, suspension, nonrenewal, or revocation of a license.

3. The department shall establish, by rule, the circumstances requiring a change in licensee, which include, but are not limited to, a change in ownership or control of the assisted living facility or licensee, a change in the licensee's form of legal organization, such as from sole proprietorship to partnership or corporation, and a dissolution or merger of the licensed entity with another legal organization. The new licensee is subject to the provisions of this chapter, the rules adopted under this chapter, and other applicable law. In order to ensure that the safety of residents is not compromised by a change in licensee, the new licensee is responsible for correction of all violations that may exist at the time of the new license.

4. The department may deny, suspend, modify, revoke, or refuse to renew a license when the department finds that the applicant or licensee or any partner, officer, director, managerial employee, or majority owner of the applicant or licensee:

   a. Operated an assisted living facility without a license or under a revoked or suspended license; or

   b. Knowingly or with reason to know made a false statement of a material fact (i) in an application for license or any data attached to the application, or (ii) in any matter under investigation by the department; or

   c. Refused to allow representatives or agents of the department to inspect (i) the books, records, and files required to be maintained, or (ii) any portion of the premises of the assisted living facility; or

   d. Willfully prevented, interfered with, or attempted to impede in any way (i) the work of any authorized representative of the department, or (ii) the lawful enforcement of any provision of this chapter; or

   e. Has a history of significant noncompliance with federal or state regulations in providing care or services to vulnerable adults or children. In deciding whether to deny, suspend, modify, revoke, or refuse to renew a license under this section, the factors the department considers shall include the gravity and frequency of the noncompliance.

   b. Create and regularly maintain current, accurate, and aggregated contact information for all residents, including contact information for the resident representative, if any, of each resident. The contact information for each resident must include the resident's name, room number, and, if available, telephone number and email address. The contact information for each resident representative must include the resident representative's name, relationship to the resident, phone number, and, if available, email and mailing address;

   c. Record and update the aggregated contact information required by this section, upon receipt of new or updated contact information from the resident or resident representative; and

   d. Upon the written request of any long-term care ombuds that includes reference to this section and the relevant legal functions and duties of long-term care ombuds, provide a copy of the aggregated contact information required by this section within 48 hours, or within a reasonable time if agreed to by the requesting long-term care ombuds by electronic copy to the secure email address or facsimile number provided in the written request.

2. In accordance with the federal older Americans act, federal regulations, and state laws that govern the state long-term care ombuds program, the department shall inform assisted living facilities that:

   a. Any long-term care ombuds is authorized to request and obtain from assisted living facilities the information required by this section in order to perform the functions and duties of long-term care ombuds as set forth in federal and state laws;

   b. The state long-term care ombuds program and all long-term care ombuds are considered a "health oversight agency," so that the federal health insurance portability and accountability act and chapter 70.02 RCW do not preclude assisted living facilities from providing the information required by this section when requested by any long-term care ombuds, and pursuant to these laws, the federal older Americans act, federal regulations, and state laws that govern the state long-term care ombuds program, facilities are not required to seek or obtain consent from residents or resident representatives prior to providing the information required by this section in accordance with the requirements of this section;

   c.

   d. The assisted living facility may not refuse to provide or unreasonably delay providing the resident roster, the contact information for a resident or resident representative, or the aggregated contact information required by this section on any basis, including on the basis that the facility must first seek or obtain consent from one or more of the residents or resident representatives.

3. Nothing in this section shall interfere with or diminish the authority of any long-term care ombuds to access facilities, residents, and resident records as otherwise authorized by law.

4. For the purposes of this section, "resident representative" has the same meaning as in RCW 70.129.010.

## 18.20.110 - Inspection of assisted living facilities—Approval of changes or new facilities.
1. The department shall make or cause to be made, at least every eighteen months with an annual average of fifteen months, an inspection and investigation of all assisted living facilities. However, the department may delay an inspection to twenty-four months if the assisted living facility has had three consecutive inspections with no written notice of violations and has received no written notice of violations resulting from complaint investigation during that same time period. The department may at anytime make an unannounced inspection of a licensed facility to assure that the licensee is in compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter. Every inspection shall focus primarily on actual or potential resident outcomes, and may include an inspection of every part of the premises and an examination of all records, methods of administration, the general and special dietary, and the stores and methods of supply; however, the department shall not have access to financial records or to other records or reports described in RCW 18.20.390. Financial records of the assisted living facility may be examined when the department has reasonable cause to believe that a financial obligation related to resident care or services will not be met, such as a complaint that staff wages or utility costs have not been paid, or when necessary for the department to investigate alleged financial exploitation of a resident. Following such an inspection or inspections, written notice of any violation of this law or the rules adopted hereunder shall be given to the applicant or licensee and the department. The department may prescribe by rule that any licensee or applicant desiring to make specified types of alterations or additions to its facilities or to construct new facilities shall, before commencing such alteration, addition, or new construction, submit plans and specifications therefor to the agencies responsible for plan reviews for preliminary inspection and approval or recommendations with respect to compliance with the rules and standards herein authorized.

2. If a pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency prevents the department from completing inspections according to the timeline in subsection (1) of this section, the department shall adopt rules to reestablish inspection timelines based on the length of time since last inspection, compliance history of each facility, and immediate health or safety concerns.

   a. Rules adopted under this subsection (2) are effective until the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency or until the department determines that all facility inspections are occurring according to time frames established in subsection (1) of this section, whichever is later. Once the department determines a rule adopted under this subsection (2) is no longer necessary, it must repeal the rule under RCW 34.05.353.

   b. Within 12 months of the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency, the department shall conduct a review of inspection compliance with subsection (1) of this section and provide the legislature with a report.

## 18.20.115 - Quality improvement consultation program—Principles.
The department shall, within available funding for this purpose, develop and make available to assisted living facilities a quality improvement consultation program using the following principles:

1. The system shall be resident-centered and promote privacy, independence, dignity, choice, and a home or home-like environment for residents consistent with chapter 70.129 RCW.

2. The goal of the system is continuous quality improvement with the focus on resident satisfaction and outcomes for residents. The quality improvement consultation program shall be offered to assisted living facilities on a voluntary basis. Based on requests for the services of the quality improvement consultation program, the department may establish a process for prioritizing service availability.

3. Assisted living facilities should be supported in their efforts to improve quality and address problems, as identified by the licensee, initially through training, consultation, and technical assistance. At a minimum, the department may, within available funding, at the request of the assisted living facility, conduct on-site visits and telephone consultations.

4. To facilitate collaboration and trust between the assisted living facilities and the department's quality improvement consultation program staff, the consultation program staff shall not simultaneously serve as department licensors, complaint investigators, or participate in any enforcement-related decisions, within the region in which they perform consultation activities; except such staff may investigate on an emergency basis, complaints anywhere in the state when the complaint indicates high risk to resident health or safety. Any records or information gained as a result of their work under the quality improvement consultation program shall not be disclosed to or shared with nonmanagerial department licensing or complaint investigation staff, unless necessary to carry out duties described under chapter 74.34 RCW. The emphasis should be on problem prevention. Nothing in this section shall limit or interfere with the consultant's mandated reporting duties under chapter 74.34 RCW.

5. The department shall promote the development of a training system that is practical and relevant to the needs of residents and staff. To improve access to training, especially for rural communities, the training system may include, but is not limited to, the use of satellite technology distance learning that is coordinated through community colleges or other appropriate organizations.

## 18.20.125 - Inspections—Enforcement remedies—Screening—Limitations on unsupervised access to vulnerable adults.
1. Inspections must be outcome based and responsive to resident complaints and based on a clear set of health, quality of care, and safety standards that are easily understandable and have been made available to facilities, residents, and other interested parties. This includes that when conducting licensing inspections, the department shall interview an appropriate percentage of residents, family members, and advocates in addition to interviewing appropriate staff.

2. Prompt and specific enforcement remedies shall also be implemented without delay, consistent with RCW 18.20.190, for facilities found to have delivered care or failed to deliver care resulting in problems that are serious, recurring, or uncorrected, or that create a hazard that is causing or likely to cause death or serious harm to one or more residents. These enforcement remedies may also include, when appropriate, reasonable conditions on a license. In the selection of remedies, the safety, health, and well-being of residents shall be of paramount importance.

3. [Empty]

   a. To the extent funding is available, the licensee, administrator, and their staff should be screened through background checks in a uniform and timely manner to ensure that they do not have a criminal history that would disqualify them from working with vulnerable adults. Employees may be provisionally hired pending the results of the background check if they have been given three positive references.

   b. Long-term care workers, as defined in RCW 74.39A.009, who are hired after January 7, 2012, are subject to background checks under RCW 74.39A.056.

4. No licensee, administrator, or staff, or prospective licensee, administrator, or staff, with a stipulated finding of fact, conclusion of law, and agreed order, or finding of fact, conclusion of law, or final order issued by a disciplining authority, a court of law, or entered into the state registry finding him or her guilty of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment of a minor or a vulnerable adult as defined in chapter 74.34 RCW shall be employed in the care of and have unsupervised access to vulnerable adults.

## 18.20.126 - Screening—Certificates of parental improvement.
Assisted living facilities, as defined in this chapter, may not automatically deny a prospective volunteer or employee solely because of a founded finding of child abuse or neglect involving the individual revealed in the record check or a court finding or a court finding that the individual's child was dependent as a result of a finding that the individual abused or neglected their child pursuant to RCW 13.34.030(6)(b) when that founded finding or court finding is accompanied by a certificate of parental improvement as defined in chapter 74.13 RCW related to the same incident without conducting a review to determine the individual's character, suitability, and competency to volunteer with vulnerable adults.

## 18.20.185 - Complaints—Toll-free telephone number—Investigation and referral—Rules—Retaliation prohibited.
1. The department shall establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number for receiving complaints regarding a facility that the department licenses.

2. All facilities that are licensed under this chapter shall post in a place and manner clearly visible to residents and visitors the department's toll-free complaint telephone number and the toll-free number and program description of the long-term care ombuds as provided by RCW 43.190.050.

3. The department shall investigate complaints if the subject of the complaint is within its authority unless the department determines that: (a) The complaint is intended to willfully harass a licensee or employee of the licensee; or (b) there is no reasonable basis for investigation; or (c) corrective action has been taken as determined by the ombuds or the department.

4. The department shall refer complaints to appropriate state agencies, law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, the long-term care ombuds, or other entities if the department lacks authority to investigate or if its investigation reveals that a follow-up referral to one or more of these entities is appropriate.

5. The department shall adopt rules that include the following complaint investigation protocols:

   a. Upon receipt of a complaint, the department shall make a preliminary review of the complaint, assess the severity of the complaint, and assign an appropriate response time. Complaints involving imminent danger to the health, safety, or well-being of a resident must be responded to within two days. When appropriate, the department shall make an on-site investigation within a reasonable time after receipt of the complaint or otherwise ensure that complaints are responded to.

   b. The complainant must be: Promptly contacted by the department, unless anonymous or unavailable despite several attempts by the department, and informed of the right to discuss alleged violations with the inspector and to provide other information the complainant believes will assist the inspector; informed of the department's course of action; and informed of the right to receive a written copy of the investigation report.

   c. In conducting the investigation, the department shall interview the complainant, unless anonymous, and shall use its best efforts to interview the resident or residents allegedly harmed by the violations, and, in addition to facility staff, any available independent sources of relevant information, including if appropriate the family members of the resident.

   d. Substantiated complaints involving harm to a resident, if an applicable law or regulation has been violated, shall be subject to one or more of the actions provided in RCW 18.20.190. Whenever appropriate, the department shall also give consultation and technical assistance to the facility.

   e. After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents, and to enforce compliance with this chapter.

   f. Substantiated complaints of neglect, abuse, exploitation, or abandonment of residents, or suspected criminal violations, shall also be referred by the department to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, and appropriate professional disciplining authority.

6. The department may provide the substance of the complaint to the licensee before the completion of the investigation by the department unless such disclosure would reveal the identity of a complainant, witness, or resident who chooses to remain anonymous. Neither the substance of the complaint provided to the licensee or contractor nor any copy of the complaint or related report published, released, or made otherwise available shall disclose, or reasonably lead to the disclosure of, the name, title, or identity of any complainant, or other person mentioned in the complaint, except that the name of the provider and the name or names of any officer, employee, or agent of the department conducting the investigation shall be disclosed after the investigation has been closed and the complaint has been substantiated. The department may disclose the identity of the complainant if such disclosure is requested in writing by the complainant. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to interfere with the obligation of the long-term care ombuds program to monitor the department's licensing, contract, and complaint investigation files for long-term care facilities.

7. The resident has the right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, and reprisal from a facility in exercising his or her rights, including the right to voice grievances about treatment furnished or not furnished. A facility licensed under this chapter shall not discriminate or retaliate in any manner against a resident, employee, or any other person on the basis or for the reason that such resident or any other person made a complaint to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, provided information, or otherwise cooperated with the investigation of such a complaint. Any attempt to discharge a resident against the resident's wishes, or any type of retaliatory treatment of a resident by whom or upon whose behalf a complaint substantiated by the department has been made to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, within one year of the filing of the complaint, raises a rebuttable presumption that such action was in retaliation for the filing of the complaint. "Retaliatory treatment" means, but is not limited to, monitoring a resident's phone, mail, or visits; involuntary seclusion or isolation; transferring a resident to a different room unless requested or based upon legitimate management reasons; withholding or threatening to withhold food or treatment unless authorized by a terminally ill resident or his or her representative pursuant to law; or persistently delaying responses to a resident's request for service or assistance. A facility licensed under this chapter shall not willfully interfere with the performance of official duties by a long-term care ombuds. The department shall sanction and may impose a civil penalty of not more than three thousand dollars for a violation of this subsection.

## 18.20.190 - Department response to noncompliance or violations.
1. The department of social and health services is authorized to take one or more of the actions listed in subsection (2) of this section in any case in which the department finds that an assisted living facility provider has:

   a. Failed or refused to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter;

   b. Operated an assisted living facility without a license or under a revoked license;

   c. Knowingly, or with reason to know, made a false statement of material fact on his or her application for license or any data attached thereto, or in any matter under investigation by the department; or

   d. Willfully prevented or interfered with any inspection or investigation by the department.

2. When authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the department may take one or more of the following actions, using a tiered sanction grid that considers the extent of harm from the deficiency and the regularity of the occurrence of the deficiency when imposing civil fines:

   a. Refuse to issue a license;

   b. Impose reasonable conditions on a license, such as correction within a specified time, training, and limits on the type of clients the provider may admit or serve;

   c. Impose civil penalties of at least one hundred dollars per day per violation. Until July 1, 2019, the civil penalties may not exceed one thousand dollars per day per violation. Beginning July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020, the civil penalties may not exceed two thousand dollars per day per violation. Beginning July 1, 2020, the civil penalties may not exceed three thousand dollars per day per violation;

   d. Impose civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars for a current or former licensed provider who is operating an unlicensed facility;

   e. Suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a license;

   f. Suspend admissions to the assisted living facility by imposing stop placement; or

   g. Suspend admission of a specific category or categories of residents as related to the violation by imposing a limited stop placement.

3. When the department orders stop placement or a limited stop placement, the facility shall not admit any new resident until the stop placement or limited stop placement order is terminated. The department may approve readmission of a resident to the facility from a hospital or nursing home during the stop placement or limited stop placement. The department shall terminate the stop placement or limited stop placement when: (a) The violations necessitating the stop placement or limited stop placement have been corrected; and (b) the provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found deficient. However, if upon the revisit the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement or new limited stop placement, the previous stop placement or limited stop placement shall remain in effect until the new stop placement or new limited stop placement is imposed.

4. After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement or limited stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents, and to enforce compliance with this chapter.

5. RCW 43.20A.205 governs notice of a license denial, revocation, suspension, or modification. Chapter 34.05 RCW applies to department actions under this section, except that orders of the department imposing license suspension, stop placement, limited stop placement, or conditions for continuation of a license are effective immediately upon notice and shall continue pending any hearing.

6. All receipts from civil penalties imposed under this chapter must be deposited in the assisted living facility temporary management account created in RCW 18.20.430.

7. For the purposes of this section, "limited stop placement" means the ability to suspend admission of a specific category or categories of residents.

## 18.20.195 - Disputed violations, enforcement remedies—Informal dispute resolution process.
1. The licensee or its designee has the right to an informal dispute resolution process to dispute any violation found or enforcement remedy imposed by the department during a licensing inspection or complaint investigation. The purpose of the informal dispute resolution process is to provide an opportunity for an exchange of information that may lead to the modification, deletion, or removal of a violation, or parts of a violation, or enforcement remedy imposed by the department.

2. The informal dispute resolution process provided by the department shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, an opportunity for review by a department employee who did not participate in, or oversee, the determination of the violation or enforcement remedy under dispute. The department shall develop, or further develop, an informal dispute resolution process consistent with this section.

3. A request for an informal dispute resolution shall be made to the department within ten working days from the receipt of a written finding of a violation or enforcement remedy. The request shall identify the violation or violations and enforcement remedy or remedies being disputed. The department shall convene a meeting, when possible, within ten working days of receipt of the request for informal dispute resolution, unless by mutual agreement a later date is agreed upon.

4. If the department determines that a violation or enforcement remedy should not be cited or imposed, the department shall delete the violation or immediately rescind or modify the enforcement remedy. If the department determines that a violation should have been cited under a different more appropriate regulation, the department shall revise the report, statement of deficiencies, or enforcement remedy accordingly. Upon request, the department shall issue a clean copy of the revised report, statement of deficiencies, or notice of enforcement action.

5. The request for informal dispute resolution does not delay the effective date of any enforcement remedy imposed by the department, except that civil monetary fines are not payable until the exhaustion of any formal hearing and appeal rights provided under this chapter. The licensee shall submit to the department, within the time period prescribed by the department, a plan of correction to address any undisputed violations, and including any violations that still remain following the informal dispute resolution.

## 18.20.220 - Residential care contracted services, conversion to—Requirements.
For the purpose of encouraging a nursing home licensed under chapter 18.51 RCW to convert a portion or all of its licensed bed capacity to provide enhanced adult residential care contracted services under chapter 74.39A RCW, the department shall:

1. Find the nursing home to be in satisfactory compliance with RCW 18.20.110 and 18.20.130, upon application for assisted living facility licensure and the production of copies of its most recent nursing home inspection reports demonstrating compliance with the safety standards and fire regulations, as required by RCW 18.51.140, and the state building code, as required by RCW 18.51.145, including any waivers that may have been granted. However, assisted living facility licensure requirements pertaining to resident to bathing fixture/toilet ratio, corridor call system, resident room door closures, and resident room windows may require modification, unless determined to be functionally equivalent, based upon a prelicensure survey inspection.

2. Allow residents receiving enhanced adult residential care services to make arrangements for on-site health care services, consistent with Title 18 RCW regulating health care professions, to the extent that such services can be provided while maintaining the resident's right to privacy and safety in treatment, but this in no way means that such services may only be provided in a private room. The provision of on-site health care services must otherwise be consistent with RCW 18.20.160 and the rules adopted under RCW 18.20.160.

## 18.20.230 - Training standards review—Proposed enhancements.
1. The department of social and health services shall review, in coordination with the department of health, the nursing care quality assurance commission, adult family home providers, assisted living facility providers, in-home personal care providers, and long-term care consumers and advocates, training standards for administrators and resident caregiving staff. Any proposed enhancements shall be consistent with this section, shall take into account and not duplicate other training requirements applicable to assisted living facilities and staff, and shall be developed with the input of assisted living facility and resident representatives, health care professionals, and other vested interest groups. Training standards and the delivery system shall be relevant to the needs of residents served by the assisted living facility and recipients of long-term in-home personal care services and shall be sufficient to ensure that administrators and caregiving staff have the skills and knowledge necessary to provide high quality, appropriate care.

2. The recommendations on training standards and the delivery system developed under subsection (1) of this section shall be based on a review and consideration of the following: Quality of care; availability of training; affordability, including the training costs incurred by the department of social and health services and private providers; portability of existing training requirements; competency testing; practical and clinical course work; methods of delivery of training; standards for management and caregiving staff training; and necessary enhancements for special needs populations and resident rights training. Residents with special needs include, but are not limited to, residents with a diagnosis of mental illness, dementia, or developmental disability.

## 18.20.250 - Federal funding programs, opportunities—Secretary's duty to comply.
The secretary may adopt rules and policies as necessary to entitle the state to participate in federal funding programs and opportunities and to facilitate state and federal cooperation in programs under the department's jurisdiction. The secretary shall ensure that any internal reorganization carried out under the terms of this chapter complies with prerequisites for the receipt of federal funding for the various programs under the department's control. When interpreting any department-related section or provision of law susceptible to more than one interpretation, the secretary shall construe that section or provision in the manner most likely to comply with federal laws and rules entitling the state to receive federal funds for the various programs of the department. If any law or rule dealing with the department is ruled to be in conflict with federal prerequisites to the allocation of federal funding to the state, the department, or its agencies, the secretary shall declare that law or rule inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict.

## 18.20.270 - Long-term caregiver training.
1. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Caregiver" includes any person who provides residents with hands-on personal care on behalf of an assisted living facility, except volunteers who are directly supervised.

   b. "Direct supervision" means oversight by a person who has demonstrated competency in the core areas or has been fully exempted from the training requirements pursuant to this section, is on the premises, and is quickly and easily available to the caregiver.

2. Training must have the following components: Orientation, basic training, specialty training as appropriate, and continuing education. All assisted living facility employees or volunteers who routinely interact with residents shall complete orientation. Assisted living facility administrators, or their designees, and caregivers shall complete orientation, basic training, specialty training as appropriate, and continuing education.

3. Orientation consists of introductory information on residents' rights, communication skills, fire and life safety, and universal precautions. Orientation must be provided at the facility by appropriate assisted living facility staff to all assisted living facility employees before the employees have routine interaction with residents.

4. Basic training consists of modules on the core knowledge and skills that caregivers need to learn and understand to effectively and safely provide care to residents. Basic training must be outcome-based, and the effectiveness of the basic training must be measured by demonstrated competency in the core areas through the use of a competency test. Basic training must be completed by caregivers within one hundred twenty days of the date on which they begin to provide hands-on care. Until competency in the core areas has been demonstrated, caregivers shall not provide hands-on personal care to residents without direct supervision. Assisted living facility administrators, or their designees, must complete basic training and demonstrate competency within one hundred twenty days of employment.

5. For assisted living facilities that serve residents with special needs such as dementia, developmental disabilities, or mental illness, specialty training is required of administrators, or designees, and caregivers.

   a. Specialty training consists of modules on the core knowledge and skills that caregivers need to effectively and safely provide care to residents with special needs. Specialty training should be integrated into basic training wherever appropriate. Specialty training must be outcome-based, and the effectiveness of the specialty training measured by demonstrated competency in the core specialty areas through the use of a competency test.

   b. Specialty training must be completed by caregivers within one hundred twenty days of the date on which they begin to provide hands-on care to a resident having special needs. However, if specialty training is not integrated with basic training, the specialty training must be completed within ninety days of completion of basic training. Until competency in the core specialty areas has been demonstrated, caregivers shall not provide hands-on personal care to residents with special needs without direct supervision.

   c. Assisted living facility administrators, or their designees, must complete specialty training and demonstrate competency within one hundred twenty days from the date on which the administrator or his or her designee is hired, if the assisted living facility serves one or more residents with special needs.

6. Continuing education consists of ongoing delivery of information to caregivers on various topics relevant to the care setting and care needs of residents. Competency testing is not required for continuing education. Continuing education is not required in the same calendar year in which basic or modified basic training is successfully completed. Continuing education is required in each calendar year thereafter. If specialty training is completed, the specialty training applies toward any continuing education requirement for up to two years following the completion of the specialty training.

7. Persons who successfully challenge the competency test for basic training are fully exempt from the basic training requirements of this section. Persons who successfully challenge the specialty training competency test are fully exempt from the specialty training requirements of this section.

8. [Empty]

   a. Registered nurses and licensed practical nurses licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW are exempt from any continuing education requirement established under this section.

   b. The department may adopt rules that would exempt licensed persons from all or part of the training requirements under this chapter, if they are (i) performing the tasks for which they are licensed and (ii) subject to chapter 18.130 RCW.

9. In an effort to improve access to training and education and reduce costs, especially for rural communities, the coordinated system of long-term care training and education must include the use of innovative types of learning strategies such as internet resources, videotapes, and distance learning using satellite technology coordinated through community colleges or other entities, as defined by the department.

10. The department shall develop criteria for the approval of orientation, basic training, and specialty training programs.

11. Assisted living facilities that desire to deliver facility-based training with facility designated trainers, or assisted living facilities that desire to pool their resources to create shared training systems, must be encouraged by the department in their efforts. The department shall develop criteria for reviewing and approving trainers and training materials that are substantially similar to or better than the materials developed by the department. The department may approve a curriculum based upon attestation by an assisted living facility administrator that the assisted living facility's training curriculum addresses basic and specialty training competencies identified by the department, and shall review a curriculum to verify that it meets these requirements. The department may conduct the review as part of the next regularly scheduled yearly inspection and investigation required under RCW 18.20.110. The department shall rescind approval of any curriculum if it determines that the curriculum does not meet these requirements.

12. The department shall adopt rules for the implementation of this section.

13. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the orientation, basic training, specialty training, and continuing education requirements of this section commence September 1, 2002, or one hundred twenty days from the date of employment, whichever is later, and shall be applied to (i) employees hired subsequent to September 1, 2002; and (ii) existing employees that on September 1, 2002, have not successfully completed the training requirements under RCW 74.39A.010 or 74.39A.020 and this section. Existing employees who have not successfully completed the training requirements under RCW 74.39A.010 or 74.39A.020 shall be subject to all applicable requirements of this section.

    b. Beginning January 7, 2012, long-term care workers, as defined in RCW 74.39A.009, employed by facilities licensed under this chapter are also subject to the training requirements under RCW 74.39A.074.

14. If a pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency makes specialty training unavailable, the department may adopt rules to allow an assisted living facility where the administrator, designee, and caregiving staff have not completed specialty training to admit a resident or residents with special needs related to mental illness, dementia, or a developmental disability. Such rules must include information about how to complete the specialty training once the training is available.

    a. Rules adopted under this subsection (14) are effective until the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency or until the department determines that providers and resident managers who were unable to complete the specialty training required in subsection (5)(b) of this section have had adequate access to complete the required training, whichever is later.

When established, the quality assurance committee shall meet at least quarterly to identify issues that may adversely affect quality of care and services to residents and to develop and implement plans of action to correct identified quality concerns or deficiencies in the quality of care provided to residents.

3. To promote quality of care through self-review without the fear of reprisal, and to enhance the objectivity of the review process, the department shall not require, and the long-term care ombuds program shall not request, disclosure of any quality assurance committee records or reports, unless the disclosure is related to the committee's compliance with this section, if:

   a. The records or reports are not maintained pursuant to statutory or regulatory mandate; and

   b. The records or reports are created for and collected and maintained by the committee.

4. If the assisted living facility refuses to release records or reports that would otherwise be protected under this section, the department may then request only that information that is necessary to determine whether the assisted living facility has a quality assurance committee and to determine that it is operating in compliance with this section. However, if the assisted living facility offers the department documents generated by, or for, the quality assurance committee as evidence of compliance with assisted living facility requirements, the documents are protected as quality assurance committee documents under subsections (6) and (8) of this section when in the possession of the department. The department is not liable for an inadvertent disclosure, a disclosure related to a required federal or state audit, or disclosure of documents incorrectly marked as quality assurance committee documents by the facility.

5. Good faith attempts by the committee to identify and correct quality deficiencies shall not be used as a basis for sanctions.

6. Information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, a quality assurance committee are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action, and no person who was in attendance at a meeting of such committee or who participated in the creation, collection, or maintenance of information or documents specifically for the committee shall be permitted or required to testify as to the content of such proceedings or the documents and information prepared specifically for the committee. This subsection does not preclude:

   a. In any civil action, the discovery of the identity of persons involved in the care that is the basis of the civil action whose involvement was independent of any quality improvement committee activity;

   b. In any civil action, the testimony of any person concerning the facts which form the basis for the institution of such proceedings of which the person had personal knowledge acquired independently of their participation in the quality assurance committee activities.

7. A quality assurance committee under subsection (1) of this section, RCW 70.41.200, 74.42.640, 4.24.250, or 43.70.510 may share information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, the committee, with one or more other quality assurance committees created under subsection (1) of this section, RCW 70.41.200, 74.42.640, 4.24.250, or 43.70.510 for the improvement of the quality of care and services rendered to assisted living facility residents. Information and documents disclosed by one quality assurance committee to another quality assurance committee and any information and documents created or maintained as a result of the sharing of information and documents shall not be subject to the discovery process and confidentiality shall be respected as required by subsections (6) and (8) of this section, RCW 43.70.510(4), 70.41.200(3), 4.24.250(1), and 74.42.640 (7) and (9). The privacy protections of chapter 70.02 RCW and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations apply to the sharing of individually identifiable patient information held by a coordinated quality improvement program. Any rules necessary to implement this section shall meet the requirements of applicable federal and state privacy laws.

8. Information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, a quality assurance committee are exempt from disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.

9. Notwithstanding any records created for the quality assurance committee, the facility shall fully set forth in the resident's records, available to the resident, the department, and others as permitted by law, the facts concerning any incident of injury or loss to the resident, the steps taken by the facility to address the resident's needs, and the resident outcome.

## 18.20.400 - Correction of violation/deficiency—Not included in facility report.
If during an inspection, reinspection, or complaint investigation by the department, an assisted living facility corrects a violation or deficiency that the department discovers, the department shall record and consider such violation or deficiency for purposes of the facility's compliance history, however the licensor or complaint investigator shall not include in the facility report the violation or deficiency if the violation or deficiency:

1. Is corrected to the satisfaction of the department prior to the exit conference;

2. Is not recurring; and

3. Did not pose a significant risk of harm or actual harm to a resident.

For the purposes of this section, "recurring" means that the violation or deficiency was found under the same regulation or statute in one of the two most recent preceding inspections, reinspections, or complaint investigations.

## 18.20.415 - Rule-making authority.
The department of health and the department of social and health services may adopt rules to implement RCW 18.20.410.

\[ [2005 c 505 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1591-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20505%20§%202); \]

## 18.20.420 - Temporary management.
1. If the department determines that the health, safety, or welfare of residents is immediately jeopardized by an assisted living facility's failure or refusal to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter, and the department summarily suspends the assisted living facility license, the department may appoint a temporary manager of the assisted living facility, or the licensee may, subject to the department's approval, voluntarily participate in the temporary management program.

The purposes of the temporary management program are as follows:

   a. To mitigate dislocation and transfer trauma of residents while the department and licensee may pursue dispute resolution or appeal of a summary suspension of license;

   b. To facilitate the continuity of safe and appropriate resident care and services;

   c. To protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents, by providing time for an orderly closure of the assisted living facility, or for the deficiencies that necessitated temporary management to be corrected; and

   d. To preserve a residential option that meets a specialized service need or is in a geographical area that has a lack of available providers.

2. The department may recruit, approve, and appoint qualified individuals, partnerships, corporations, and other entities interested in serving as a temporary manager of an assisted living facility. These individuals and entities shall satisfy the criteria established under this chapter or by the department for approving licensees. The department shall not approve or appoint any person, including partnerships and other entities, if that person is affiliated with the assisted living facility subject to the temporary management, or has owned or operated an assisted living facility ordered into temporary management or receivership in any state. When approving or appointing a temporary manager, the department shall consider the temporary manager's past experience in long-term care, the quality of care provided, the temporary manager's availability, and the person's familiarity with applicable state and federal laws. Subject to the provisions of this section and RCW 18.20.430, the department's authority to approve or appoint a temporary manager is discretionary and not subject to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.

3. When the department appoints a temporary manager, the department shall enter into a contract with the temporary manager and shall order the licensee to cease operating the assisted living facility and immediately turn over to the temporary manager possession and control of the assisted living facility, including but not limited to all resident care records, financial records, and other records necessary for operation of the facility while temporary management is in effect. If the department has not appointed a temporary manager and the licensee elects to participate in the temporary management program, the licensee shall select the temporary manager, subject to the department's approval, and enter into a contract with the temporary manager, consistent with this section. The department has the discretion to approve or revoke any temporary management arrangements made by the licensee.

4. When the department appoints a temporary manager, the costs associated with the temporary management may be paid for through the assisted living facility temporary management account established by RCW 18.20.430, or from other departmental funds, or a combination thereof. All funds must be administered according to department procedures. The department may enter into an agreement with the licensee allowing the licensee to pay for some of the costs associated with a temporary manager appointed by the department. If the department has not appointed a temporary manager and the licensee elects to participate in the temporary management program, the licensee is responsible for all costs related to administering the temporary management program at the assisted living facility and contracting with the temporary manager.

5. The temporary manager shall assume full responsibility for the daily operations of the assisted living facility and is responsible for correcting cited deficiencies and ensuring that all minimum licensing requirements are met. The temporary manager must comply with all state and federal laws and regulations applicable to assisted living facilities. The temporary manager shall protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents for the duration of the temporary management and shall perform all acts reasonably necessary to ensure residents' needs are met. The temporary management contract shall address the responsibility of the temporary manager to pay past due debts. The temporary manager's specific responsibilities may include, but are not limited to:

   a. Receiving and expending in a prudent and business-like manner all current revenues of the assisted living facility, provided that priority is given to debts and expenditures directly related to providing care and meeting residents' needs;

   b. Hiring and managing all consultants and employees and firing them for good cause;

   c. Making necessary purchases, repairs, and replacements, provided that such expenditures in excess of five thousand dollars by a temporary manager appointed by the department must be approved by the department;

   d. Entering into contracts necessary for the operation of the assisted living facility;

   e. Preserving resident trust funds and resident records; and

   f. Preparing all department-required reports, including a detailed monthly accounting of all expenditures and liabilities, which shall be sent to the department and the licensee.

6. The licensee and department shall provide written notification immediately to all residents, resident representatives, interested family members, and the state long-term care ombuds program of the temporary management and the reasons for it. This notification shall include notice that residents may move from the assisted living facility without notifying the licensee or temporary manager in advance, and without incurring any charges, fees, or costs otherwise available for insufficient advance notice, during the temporary management period. The notification shall also inform residents and their families or representatives that the temporary management team will provide residents help with relocation and appropriate discharge planning and coordination if desired. The department shall provide assistance with relocation to residents who are department clients and may provide such assistance to other residents. The temporary manager shall meet regularly with staff, residents, residents' representatives, and families to inform them of the plans for and progress achieved in the correction of deficiencies, and of the plans for facility closure or continued operation.

7. The department shall terminate temporary management:

   a. After sixty days unless good cause is shown to continue the temporary management. Good cause for continuing the temporary management exists when returning the assisted living facility to its former licensee would subject residents to a threat to health, safety, or welfare;

   b. When all residents are transferred and the assisted living facility is closed;

   c. When deficiencies threatening residents' health, safety, or welfare are eliminated and the former licensee agrees to department-specified conditions regarding the continued facility operation; or

   d. When a new licensee assumes control of the assisted living facility.

Nothing in this section precludes the department from revoking its approval of the temporary management or exercising its licensing enforcement authority under this chapter. The department's decision whether to approve or to revoke a temporary management arrangement is not subject to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.

8. The department shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless any temporary manager appointed or approved under this section against claims made against the temporary manager for any actions by the temporary manager or its agents that do not amount to intentional torts or criminal behavior.

9. The department may adopt rules implementing this section. In the development of rules or policies implementing this section, the department shall consult with residents and their representatives, resident advocates, financial professionals, assisted living facility providers, and organizations representing assisted living facilities.

## 18.20.430 - Assisted living facility temporary management account.
The assisted living facility temporary management account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from civil penalties imposed under this chapter must be deposited into the account. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the protection of the health, safety, welfare, or property of residents of assisted living facilities found to be deficient. Uses of the account include, but are not limited to:

1. Payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities;

2. Payment to maintain operation of an assisted living facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, including payment of costs associated with temporary management authorized under this chapter;

3. Reimbursement of residents for personal funds or property lost or stolen when the resident's personal funds or property cannot be recovered from the assisted living facility or third-party insurer; and

4. The protection of the health, safety, welfare, and property of residents of assisted living facilities found to be noncompliant with licensing standards.

## 18.20.440 - Withdrawal from medicaid program—Notice—Duties.
1. If an assisted living facility voluntarily withdraws from participation in a state medicaid program for residential care and services under chapter 74.39A RCW, but continues to provide services of the type provided by assisted living facilities, the facility's voluntary withdrawal from participation is not an acceptable basis for the transfer or discharge of residents of the facility (a) who were receiving medicaid on the day before the effective date of the withdrawal; or (b) who have been paying the facility privately for at least two years and who become eligible for medicaid within one hundred eighty days of the date of withdrawal.

3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the medicaid contract under chapter 74.39A RCW that exists on the day the facility withdraws from medicaid participation is deemed to continue in effect as to the persons described in subsection (1) of this section for the purposes of:

   a. Department payments for the residential care and services provided to such persons;

   b. Maintaining compliance with all requirements of the medicaid contract between the department and the facility; and

   c. Ongoing inspection, contracting, and enforcement authority under the medicaid contract, regulations, and law.

4. Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, this section shall not apply to a person who begins residence in a facility on or after the effective date of the facility's withdrawal from participation in the medicaid program for residential care and services.
