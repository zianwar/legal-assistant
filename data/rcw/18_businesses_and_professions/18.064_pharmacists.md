## 18.64.043 - Pharmacy license—Fee—Display—Declaration of ownership and location—Penalties.
1. The owner of each pharmacy shall pay an original license fee to be determined by the secretary, and annually thereafter, on or before a date to be determined by the secretary, a fee to be determined by the secretary, for which he or she shall receive a license of location, which shall entitle the owner to operate such pharmacy at the location specified, or such other temporary location as the secretary may approve, for the period ending on a date to be determined by the secretary as provided in RCW 43.70.250 and 43.70.280, and each such owner shall at the time of filing proof of payment of such fee as provided in RCW 18.64.045 as now or hereafter amended, file with the commission on a blank therefor provided, a declaration of ownership and location, which declaration of ownership and location so filed as aforesaid shall be deemed presumptive evidence of ownership of the pharmacy mentioned therein.

2. [Empty]

   a. For a hospital licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW, the license of location provided under this section may include any individual practitioner's office or multipractitioner clinic owned, operated, or under common control with a hospital, and identified by the hospital on the pharmacy application or renewal. The definition of "hospital" under RCW 70.41.020 to exclude "clinics, or physician's offices where patients are not regularly kept as bed patients for twenty-four hours or more," does not limit the ability of a hospital to include individual practitioner's offices or multipractitioner clinics owned, operated, or under common control with a hospital on the pharmacy application or renewal or otherwise prevent the implementation of chapter 118, Laws of 2016. A hospital that elects to include one or more offices or clinics under this subsection on its hospital pharmacy application shall describe the type of services relevant to the practice of pharmacy provided at each such office or clinic as requested by the commission. Any updates to the application, renewal, or related forms that are necessary to accomplish the provision of this licensure option must be made no later than ninety days after June 9, 2016. Nothing in this section limits the ability of a hospital to transfer drugs to another location consistent with federal laws and RCW 70.41.490, regardless of whether or not an election has been made with respect to adding the receiving location to the hospital's pharmacy license under this section.

   b. This chapter must be interpreted in a manner that supports regulatory, inspection, and investigation standards that are reasonable and appropriate based on the level of risk and the type of services provided in a pharmacy, including pharmacy services provided in a hospital and pharmacy services provided in an individual practitioner office or multipractitioner clinic owned, operated, or under common control with a hospital regardless of the office or clinic's physical address. The commission shall provide clear and specific information regarding the standards to which particular pharmacy services will be held, as appropriate, based on the type of pharmacy service provided at a particular location.

   c. The secretary may adopt rules to establish an additional reasonable fee for any such office or clinic.

3. It shall be the duty of the owner to immediately notify the commission of any change of location, ownership, or licensure and to keep the license of location or the renewal thereof properly exhibited in said pharmacy.

4. Failure to comply with this section shall be deemed a misdemeanor, and each day that said failure continues shall be deemed a separate offense.

5. In the event such license fee remains unpaid on the date due, no renewal or new license shall be issued except upon compliance with administrative procedures, administrative requirements, and fees determined as provided in RCW 43.70.250 and 43.70.280.

6. If the commission determines that rules are necessary for the immediate implementation of the inspection standards described in this section, it must adopt rules under the emergency rule-making process in RCW 34.05.350, with such emergency rules effective not later than ninety days after June 9, 2016. The commission shall then begin the process to adopt any necessary permanent rules in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. The commission shall ensure that during the transition to the permanent rules adopted under this section, an emergency rule remains in effect without a break between the original emergency rule and any subsequent emergency rules that may be necessary. The commission shall ensure that during the transition to permanent rules there is no interruption in provision of the licensure option described under this section.

As a prerequisite for initial licensure and renewal of a license by the department of health, the nonresident pharmacy must submit a copy of an inspection report:

      i. Conducted by an inspection program approved by the commission as having substantially equivalent standards to those of the commission; and

      ii. Issued within two years of application or renewal of a license; and

   c. Proof that it maintains its records of controlled substances, legend drugs, or devices dispensed to patients in this state so that the records are readily retrievable from the records of other drugs dispensed.

2. Any pharmacy subject to this section shall, during its regular hours of operation, provide a toll-free telephone service to facilitate communication between patients in this state and a pharmacist at the pharmacy who has access to the patient's records. This toll-free number shall be disclosed on the label affixed to each container of drugs dispensed to patients in this state.

3. A pharmacy subject to this section shall comply with commission rules regarding the maintenance and use of patient medication record systems.

The commission may grant an exemption from licensing under this section upon application by an out-of-state pharmacy that restricts its dispensing activity in Washington to isolated transactions.

8. Each nonresident pharmacy that ships, mails, or delivers legend drugs or devices into this state shall designate a resident agent in Washington for service of process. The designation of such an agent does not indicate that the nonresident pharmacy is a resident of Washington for tax purposes.

9. The commission shall attempt to develop a reciprocal licensing agreement for licensure of nonresident pharmacies with Health Canada or an applicable Canadian province. If the commission is unable to develop such an agreement, the commission shall develop a process to license participating Canadian nonresident pharmacies through on-site inspection and certification.

A licensed nurse, pharmacist, or physician practicing in a long-term care facility or hospice program may act as the practitioner's agent for purposes of this chapter, without need for a written agency agreement, to document a chart order in the patient's medical record on behalf of the prescribing practitioner pending the prescribing practitioner's signature; or to communicate a prescription to a pharmacy whether telephonically, via facsimile, or electronically. The communication of a prescription to a dispenser by the prescriber's agent has the same force and effect as if communicated directly by the authorized practitioner.

3. Nothing in this chapter prevents an authorized credentialed employee of a long-term care facility from transmitting a chart order pursuant to RCW 74.42.230, or transmitting a prescription on behalf of a resident to the extent otherwise authorized by law.

Emergency kits must be secured in a locked room, container, or device to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure the proper environment for preservation of the drugs.

Supplemental dose kits must be secured in a locked room, container, or device to prevent unauthorized access, and to ensure the proper environment for preservation of the drugs. Administration of drugs from a supplemental dose kit must be under a valid prescription or chart order.

The types and quantity of drugs appropriate to serve the resident or patient population of a nursing home or hospice program using an emergency kit or supplemental dose kit and procedures for the proper storage and security of drugs must be determined by a pharmaceutical services committee that includes a pharmacist licensed under this chapter, a physician licensed under chapter 18.71 RCW, an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 18.57 RCW, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, and appropriate clinical or administrative personnel of the nursing home or hospice program as set forth in rules adopted by the pharmacy quality assurance commission.
