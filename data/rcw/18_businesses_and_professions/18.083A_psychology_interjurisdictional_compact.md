## 18.83A.010 - Findings.
1. The legislature finds:

   a. States license psychologists in order to protect the public through verification of education, training, and experience, and to ensure accountability for professional practice;

   b. The psychology interjurisdictional compact is intended to regulate the day-to-day practice of telepsychology and the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;

   c. The psychology interjurisdictional compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;

   d. The psychology interjurisdictional compact is intended to authorize state psychology regulatory authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the compact, to psychologists licensed in another state;

   e. The psychology interjurisdictional compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that state regulation best protects public health and safety;

   f. The psychology interjurisdictional compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the home and receiving states; and

   g. The psychology interjurisdictional compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice; it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.

2. Consistent with the findings of subsection (1) of this section, the psychology interjurisdictional compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:

   a. Increase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for telepsychological practice across state lines as well as temporary in-person, face-to-face services into a state in which the psychologist is not licensed to practice psychology;

   b. Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially client/patient safety;

   c. Encourage the cooperation of compact states in the areas of psychology licensure and regulation;

   d. Facilitate the exchange of information between compact states regarding psychologist licensure, adverse actions, and disciplinary history;

   e. Promote compliance with the laws governing psychological practice in each compact state; and

   f. Invest all compact states with the authority to hold licensed psychologists accountable through the mutual recognition of compact state licenses.

## 18.83A.070 - Adverse actions.

A home state's psychology regulatory authority must investigate and take appropriate action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a licensee which occurred in a receiving state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the home state. In such cases, the home state's law controls in determining any adverse action against a psychologist's license.

5. A distant state's psychology regulatory authority must investigate and take appropriate action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist practicing under a temporary authorization to practice which occurred by a distant state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the home state.

6. Nothing in this compact overrides a compact state's decision that a psychologist's participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation remains nonpublic if required by the compact state's law. Compact states must require psychologists who enter any alternative programs to not provide telepsychology services under the authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology services under the temporary authorization to practice in any other compact state during the term of the alternative program.

7. No other judicial or administrative remedy is available to a psychologist if a compact state imposes an adverse action under subsection (3) of this section.

1. In addition to any other powers granted under state law, a compact state's psychology regulatory authority may:

   a. Issue subpoenas, for both hearings and investigations, which require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a compact state's psychology regulatory authority for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of evidence from another compact state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court's practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing state psychology regulatory authority must pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located; and

   b. Issue cease and desist or injunctive relief orders to revoke a psychologist's authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology or temporary authorization to practice.

2. During the course of any investigation, a psychologist may not change his or her home state licensure. A home state psychology regulatory authority may complete any pending investigations of a psychologist and take any actions appropriate under its law. The home state psychology regulatory authority must promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the commission. Once an investigation has been completed, and pending the outcome of the investigation, the psychologist may change his or her home state licensure. The commission must promptly notify the new home state of any such decisions as provided in the rules of the commission. All information provided to the commission or distributed by compact states under the investigation of the psychologist is confidential, filed under seal, and used for investigatory or disciplinary matters.
