## 18.120.010 - Purpose—Criteria.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for the regulation of health professions not licensed or regulated prior to July 24, 1983, and those licensed or regulated health professions which seek to substantially increase their scope of practice: PROVIDED, That the provisions of this chapter are not intended and shall not be construed to: (a) Apply to any regulatory entity created prior to July 24, 1983, except as provided in this chapter; (b) affect the powers and responsibilities of the superintendent of public instruction or Washington professional educator standards board under RCW 28A.410.210 and 28A.410.010; (c) apply to or interfere in any way with the practice of religion or to any kind of treatment by prayer; and (d) apply to any remedial or technical amendments to any statutes which licensed or regulated activity before July 24, 1983. The legislature believes that all individuals should be permitted to enter into a health profession unless there is an overwhelming need for the state to protect the interests of the public by restricting entry into the profession. Where such a need is identified, the regulation adopted by the state should be set at the least restrictive level consistent with the public interest to be protected.

2. It is the intent of this chapter that no regulation shall, after July 24, 1983, be imposed upon any health profession except for the exclusive purpose of protecting the public interest. All bills introduced in the legislature to regulate a health profession for the first time should be reviewed according to the following criteria. A health profession should be regulated by the state only when:

   a. Unregulated practice can clearly harm or endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is easily recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument;

   b. The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability; and

   c. The public cannot be effectively protected by other means in a more cost-beneficial manner.

3. After evaluating the criteria in subsection (2) of this section and considering governmental and societal costs and benefits, if the legislature finds that it is necessary to regulate a health profession not previously regulated by law, the least restrictive alternative method of regulation should be implemented, consistent with the public interest and this section:

   a. Where existing common law and statutory civil actions and criminal prohibitions are not sufficient to eradicate existing harm, the regulation should provide for stricter civil actions and criminal prosecutions;

   b. Where a service is being performed for individuals involving a hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare, the regulation should impose inspection requirements and enable an appropriate state agency to enforce violations by injunctive relief in court, including, but not limited to, regulation of the business activity providing the service rather than the employees of the business;

   c. Where the threat to the public health, safety, or economic well-being is relatively small as a result of the operation of the health profession, the regulation should implement a system of registration;

   d. Where the consumer may have a substantial basis for relying on the services of a practitioner, the regulation should implement a system of certification; or

   e. Where apparent that adequate regulation cannot be achieved by means other than licensing, the regulation should implement a system of licensing.

   c. The extent of autonomy a practitioner has, as indicated by:

      i. The extent to which the health profession calls for independent judgment and the extent of skill or experience required in making the independent judgment; and

      ii. The extent to which practitioners are supervised;

2. The efforts made to address the problem:

   a. Voluntary efforts, if any, by members of the health profession to:

      i. Establish a code of ethics; or

      ii. Help resolve disputes between health practitioners and consumers; and

   b. Recourse to and the extent of use of applicable law and whether it could be strengthened to control the problem;

3. The alternatives considered:

   a. Regulation of business employers or practitioners rather than employee practitioners;

   b. Regulation of the program or service rather than the individual practitioners;

   c. Registration of all practitioners;

   a. The extent to which the incidence of specific problems present in the unregulated health profession can reasonably be expected to be reduced by regulation;

   b. Whether the public can identify qualified practitioners;

   c. The extent to which the public can be confident that qualified practitioners are competent:

      i. Whether the proposed regulatory entity would be a board composed of members of the profession and public members, or a state agency, or both, and, if appropriate, their respective responsibilities in administering the system of registration, certification, or licensure, including the composition of the board and the number of public members, if any; the powers and duties of the board or state agency regarding examinations and for cause revocation, suspension, and nonrenewal of registrations, certificates, or licenses; the promulgation of rules and canons of ethics; the conduct of inspections; the receipt of complaints and disciplinary action taken against practitioners; and how fees would be levied and collected to cover the expenses of administering and operating the regulatory system;

      ii. If there is a grandfather clause, whether such practitioners will be required to meet the prerequisite qualifications established by the regulatory entity at a later date;

      iii. The nature of the standards proposed for registration, certification, or licensure as compared with the standards of other jurisdictions;

      iv. Whether the regulatory entity would be authorized to enter into reciprocity agreements with other jurisdictions;

      v.

      vi. What additional training programs are anticipated to be necessary to assure training accessible statewide; the anticipated time required to establish the additional training programs; the types of institutions capable of providing the training; a description of how training programs will meet the needs of the expected workforce, including reentry workers, minorities, placebound students, and others;

   d. Assurance of the public that practitioners have maintained their competence:

      i. Whether the registration, certification, or licensure will carry an expiration date; and

      ii. Whether renewal will be based only upon payment of a fee, or whether renewal will involve reexamination, peer review, or other enforcement;

5. The extent to which regulation might harm the public:

   a. The extent to which regulation will restrict entry into the health profession:

      i. Whether the proposed standards are more restrictive than necessary to insure safe and effective performance; and

      ii. Whether the proposed legislation requires registered, certificated, or licensed practitioners in other jurisdictions who migrate to this state to qualify in the same manner as state applicants for registration, certification, and licensure when the other jurisdiction has substantially equivalent requirements for registration, certification, or licensure as those in this state; and

   b. Whether there are similar professions to that of the applicant group which should be included in, or portions of the applicant group which should be excluded from, the proposed legislation;

6. The maintenance of standards:

   a. Whether effective quality assurance standards exist in the health profession, such as legal requirements associated with specific programs that define or enforce standards, or a code of ethics; and

   b. How the proposed legislation will assure quality:

      i. The extent to which a code of ethics, if any, will be adopted; and

      ii. The grounds for suspension or revocation of registration, certification, or licensure;

7. A description of the group proposed for regulation, including a list of associations, organizations, and other groups representing the practitioners in this state, an estimate of the number of practitioners in each group, and whether the groups represent different levels of practice; and

8. The expected costs of regulation:

   a. The impact registration, certification, or licensure will have on the costs of the services to the public;

   b. The cost to the state and to the general public of implementing the proposed legislation; and

## 18.120.040 - Applicants for regulation—Written reports—Recommendations by state board of health and department of health.
Applicant groups shall submit a written report explaining the factors enumerated in RCW 18.120.030 to the legislative committees of reference, copies of which shall be sent to the state board of health and the department of health for review and comment. The state board of health and the department of health shall make recommendations based on the report submitted by applicant groups to the extent requested by the legislative committees.

## 18.120.050 - Continuing education requirements—Legislative proposals—Evidence of effectiveness.
Requirements for licensees to engage in continuing education as a condition of continued licensure has not been proven to be an effective method of guaranteeing or improving the competence of licensees or the quality of care received by the consumer. The legislature has serious reservations concerning the appropriateness of mandated continuing education. Any legislative proposal which contains a continuing education requirement should be accompanied by evidence that such a requirement has been proven effective for the profession addressed in the legislation.
