## 18.235.005 - Intent.
It is the intent of the legislature to consolidate disciplinary procedures for the licensed businesses and professions under the department of licensing by providing a uniform disciplinary act with standardized procedures for the regulation of businesses and professions and the enforcement of laws, the purpose of which is to assure the public of the adequacy of business and professional competence and conduct.

It is also the intent of the legislature that all businesses and professions newly credentialed by the state and regulated by the department of licensing come under this chapter.

Where payment of a fine is required as a result of a disciplinary action under RCW 18.235.060 or 18.235.150 and timely payment is not made as directed in the final order, the disciplinary authority may enforce the order for payment in the superior court in the county in which the hearing was held. This right of enforcement is in addition to any other rights the disciplinary authority may have as to any licensee ordered to pay a fine but may not be construed to limit a licensee's ability to seek judicial review under RCW 18.235.090. In any action for enforcement of an order of payment of a fine, the disciplinary authority's order is conclusive proof of the validity of the order of a fine and the terms of payment.

## 18.235.130 - Unprofessional conduct—Acts or conditions that constitute.
The following conduct, acts, or conditions constitute unprofessional conduct for any license holder or applicant under the jurisdiction of this chapter:

1. The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession or operation of the person's business, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. At the disciplinary hearing a certified copy of a final holding of any court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive evidence of the conduct of the license holder or applicant upon which a conviction or the final holding is based. Upon a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder or applicant of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based. For the purposes of this subsection, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for the conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Except as specifically provided by law, nothing in this subsection abrogates the provisions of chapter 9.96A RCW. However, RCW 9.96A.020 does not apply to a person who is required to register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.130;

2. Misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact in obtaining or renewing a license or in reinstatement thereof;

3. Advertising that is false, deceptive, or misleading;

4. Incompetence, negligence, or malpractice that results in harm or damage to another or that creates an unreasonable risk of harm or damage to another;

5. The suspension, revocation, or restriction of a license to engage in any business or profession by competent authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction. A certified copy of the order, stipulation, or agreement is conclusive evidence of the revocation, suspension, or restriction;

6. Failure to cooperate with the disciplinary authority in the course of an investigation, audit, or inspection authorized by law by:

   a. Not furnishing any papers or documents requested by the disciplinary authority;

   b. Not furnishing in writing an explanation covering the matter contained in a complaint when requested by the disciplinary authority;

   c. Not responding to a subpoena issued by the disciplinary authority, whether or not the recipient of the subpoena is the accused in the proceeding; or

   d. Not providing authorized access, during regular business hours, to representatives of the disciplinary authority conducting an investigation, inspection, or audit at facilities utilized by the license holder or applicant;

7. Failure to comply with an order issued by the disciplinary authority;

8. Violating any of the provisions of this chapter or the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020(2) or any rules made by the disciplinary authority under the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020(2);

9. Aiding or abetting an unlicensed person to practice or operate a business or profession when a license is required;

10. Practice or operation of a business or profession beyond the scope of practice or operation as defined by law or rule;

11. Misrepresentation in any aspect of the conduct of the business or profession;

12. Failure to adequately supervise or oversee auxiliary staff, whether employees or contractors, to the extent that consumers may be harmed or damaged;

13. Conviction of any gross misdemeanor or felony relating to the practice of the person's profession or operation of the person's business. For the purposes of this subsection, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Except as specifically provided by law, nothing in this subsection abrogates the provisions of chapter 9.96A RCW. However, RCW 9.96A.020 does not apply to a person who is required to register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.130; 

14. Interference with an investigation or disciplinary action by willful misrepresentation of facts before the disciplinary authority or its authorized representatives, or by the use of threats or harassment against any consumer or witness to discourage them from providing evidence in a disciplinary action or any other legal action, or by the use of financial inducements to any consumer or witness to prevent or attempt to prevent him or her from providing evidence in a disciplinary action; and

15. Engaging in unlicensed practice as defined in RCW 18.235.010.

## 18.235.140 - Final order issued under RCW  18.235.130—Failure to comply.
If a person or business regulated by this chapter violates or fails to comply with a final order issued under RCW 18.235.130, the attorney general, any prosecuting attorney, the director, the board or commission, or any other person may maintain an action in the name of the state of Washington to enjoin the person from violating the order or failing to comply with the order. The injunction does not relieve the offender from criminal prosecution, but the remedy by injunction is in addition to the liability of the offender to criminal prosecution and disciplinary action.

\[ [2002 c 86 § 115](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2512-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%2086%20§%20115); \]

## 18.235.150 - Investigation of complaint—Cease and desist order/notice of intent to issue—Final determination—Fine—Temporary cease and desist order—Action/who may maintain—Remedies not limited.
1. The disciplinary authority may investigate complaints concerning practice by unlicensed persons of a profession or business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020. In the investigation of the complaints, the director has the same authority as provided the disciplinary authority under RCW 18.235.030.

2. The disciplinary authority may issue a notice of intent to issue a cease and desist order to any person whom the disciplinary authority has reason to believe is engaged or is about to engage in the unlicensed practice of a profession or operation of a business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020.

3. The disciplinary authority may issue a notice of intent to issue a cease and desist order to any person whom the disciplinary authority has reason to believe is engaged or is about to engage in an act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter or the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020(2) or a rule adopted or order issued under those chapters.

4. The person to whom such a notice is issued may request an adjudicative proceeding to contest the allegations. The notice shall include a brief, plain statement of the alleged unlicensed activities, act, or practice constituting a violation of this chapter or the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020(2) or a rule adopted or order issued under those chapters. The request for hearing must be filed within twenty days after service of the notice of intent to issue a cease and desist order. The failure to request a hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the disciplinary authority may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine. All proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

5. If the disciplinary authority makes a final determination that a person has engaged or is engaging in unlicensed practice or other act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter or the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020(2) or a rule adopted or order issued under those chapters, the disciplinary authority may issue a permanent cease and desist order. In addition, the disciplinary authority may impose a civil fine in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars for each day upon which the person engaged in the unlicensed practice of a profession or operation of a business for which a license is required by one or more of the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020. The proceeds of such a fine shall be deposited in the related program account.

6. The disciplinary authority may issue a temporary cease and desist order if a person is engaged or is about to engage in unlicensed practice or other act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter or the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020(2) or a rule adopted or order issued under those chapters if the disciplinary authority makes a written finding of fact that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order. The person receiving a temporary cease and desist order shall be provided an opportunity for a prompt hearing. A temporary cease and desist order shall remain in effect until further order of the disciplinary authority. The failure to request a prompt or regularly scheduled hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the disciplinary authority may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine.

7. The cease and desist order is conclusive proof of unlicensed practice or other act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter or the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020(2) or a rule adopted or order issued under those chapters and may be enforced under RCW 7.21.060. This method of enforcement of the cease and desist order or civil fine may be used in addition to, or as an alternative to, any provisions for enforcement of agency orders set out in chapter 34.05 RCW.

8. The attorney general, a county prosecuting attorney, the director, a board or commission, or any person may, in accordance with the laws of this state governing injunctions, maintain an action in the name of the state of Washington to enjoin any person practicing a profession or business without a license for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.235.020. All fees, fines, forfeitures, and penalties collected or assessed by a court because of a violation of this section shall be deposited in the related program account.

9. The civil remedies in this section do not limit the ability to pursue criminal prosecution as authorized in any of the acts specified in RCW 18.235.020 nor do the civil remedies limit any criminal sanctions.

## 18.235.160 - Violation of injunction—Contempt of court—Civil penalty.
A person or business that violates an injunction issued under this chapter may be found in contempt of court under RCW 7.21.010. Upon a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the person or business is in contempt, the court may order any remedial sanction as authorized by RCW 7.21.030. Further, the court may, in addition to the remedial sanctions available under RCW 7.21.030, order the person or business to pay a civil penalty to the state in an amount not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, which shall be deposited in the related program account. For the purposes of this section, the superior court issuing any injunction retains jurisdiction and the cause shall be continued, and in such cases the attorney general acting in the name of the state may petition for the recovery of civil penalties.
