      ii. The department staff confirms in a timely fashion not to exceed fifteen working days that:

          A.  The deficiencies necessitating stop placement action have been corrected, and

          B.  The provider exhibits the capacity to maintain adequate care and service.

   a. Oversee the operation of the facility; and

   b. Ensure the health and safety of the facilities residents while:

      i. Orderly closure of the facility occurs; or

      ii. The deficiencies necessitating temporary management are corrected.

## 18.51.280 - Chapter cumulative.
The remedies provided by this chapter are cumulative, and shall not be construed as restricting any remedy, provisional or otherwise, provided by law for the benefit of any party, and no judgment under this chapter shall preclude any party from obtaining additional relief based upon the same facts.

## 18.51.400 - Receivership—Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that the closure of a nursing home can have devastating effects on residents and, under certain circumstances, courts should consider placing nursing homes in receivership. As receivership has long existed as a remedy to preserve assets subject to litigation and to reorganize troubled affairs, the legislature finds that receivership is to be used to correct problems associated with either the disregard of residents' health, safety, or welfare or with the possible closure of the nursing home for any reason.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%209); \]

## 18.51.410 - Receivership—Petition to establish—Grounds.
A petition to establish a receivership shall allege that one or more of the following conditions exist and that the current operator has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to take actions necessary to immediately correct the conditions alleged:

1. The facility is operating without a license;

2. The facility has not given the department prior written notice of its intent to close and has not made arrangements within thirty days before closure for the orderly transfer of its residents: PROVIDED, That if the facility has given the department prior written notice but the department has not acted with all deliberate speed to transfer the facility's residents, this shall bar the filing of a petition under this subsection;

3. The health, safety, or welfare of the facility's residents is immediately jeopardized;

4. The facility demonstrates a pattern and practice of violating chapter 18.51 or 74.42 RCW and rules adopted thereunder such that the facility has demonstrated a repeated inability to maintain minimum patient care standards; or

5. The facility demonstrates a pattern or practice of violating a condition level as defined by the federal government under the authority of Title XIX of the social security act.

The department may file a petition in the superior court in the county in which the nursing home is located or in the superior court of Thurston county. The current or former operator or licensee and the owner of the nursing home, if different than the operator or licensee, shall be made a party to the action. The court shall grant the petition if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions listed in subsections (1) through (5) of this section exists and, subject to RCW 18.51.420, that the current operator is unable or unwilling to take actions necessary to immediately correct the conditions.

\[ [1989 c 372 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c372.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20372%20§%2010); [1987 c 476 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2010); \]

## 18.51.420 - Receivership—Defenses to petition.
It shall be a defense to the petition to establish a receivership that the conditions alleged do not in fact exist. It shall not be a defense to the petition to allege that the respondent did not possess knowledge of the alleged condition or could not have been reasonably expected to know about the alleged condition. In a petition that alleges that the health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the facility is at issue, it shall not be a defense to the petition that the respondent had not been afforded a reasonable opportunity to correct the alleged condition.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2011); \]

## 18.51.430 - Receivership—Persons qualified to act as receiver.
A petition for receivership shall include the name of the candidate for receiver. The department shall maintain a list of qualified persons to act as receivers, however, no person may be considered to be qualified to be a receiver who:

1. Is the owner, licensee, or administrator of the facility;

2. Is affiliated with the facility;

3. Has a financial interest in the facility at the time the receiver is appointed; or

4. Has owned or operated a nursing home that has been ordered into receivership.

If a receiver is appointed, he or she may be drawn from the list but need not be, but an appointee shall have experience in providing long-term health care and a history of satisfactory operation of a nursing home. Preference may be granted to persons expressing an interest in permanent operation of the facility.

\[ [1989 c 372 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c372.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20372%20§%203); [1987 c 476 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2012); \]

## 18.51.440 - Receivership—Judicial hearing.
Upon receipt of a petition for receivership, the court shall hear the matter within fourteen days. Temporary relief may be obtained under chapter 7.40 RCW and other applicable laws. In all actions arising under RCW 18.51.410 through 18.51.530, the posting of a certified copy of the summons and petition in a conspicuous place in the nursing home shall constitute service of those documents upon the respondent.

\[ [1989 c 372 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c372.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20372%20§%2011); [1987 c 476 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2013); \]

## 18.51.450 - Receivership—Appointment of receiver.
Upon agreement of the candidate for receiver to the terms of the receivership and any special instructions of the court, the court may appoint that person as receiver of the nursing home if the court determines it is likely that a permanent operator will be found or conditions will be corrected without undue risk of harm to the patients. Appointment of a receiver may be in lieu of or in addition to temporary removal of some or all of the patients in the interests of their health, security, or welfare. A receiver shall be appointed for a term not to exceed six months, but a term may be extended for good cause shown.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2014); \]

## 18.51.460 - Receivership—Termination—Conditions.
1. The receivership shall terminate:

   a. When all deficiencies have been eliminated and the court determines that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all requirements; or

   b. When all residents have been transferred and the facility closed.

2. Upon the termination of a receivership, the court may impose conditions to assure the continued compliance with chapters 18.51 and 74.42 RCW, and, in the case of medicaid contractors, continued compliance with Title XIX of the social security act, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder.

\[ [1989 c 372 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c372.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20372%20§%2012); [1987 c 476 § 15](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2015); \]

## 18.51.470 - Receivership—Accounting of acts and expenditures by receiver.
The receiver shall render to the court an accounting of acts performed and expenditures made during the receivership. Nothing in this section relieves a court-appointed receiver from the responsibility of making all reports and certifications to the department required by law and regulation relating to the receiver's operation of the nursing home, the care of its residents, and participation in the medicaid program, if any.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 16](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2016); \]

## 18.51.480 - Receivership—Compensation, liability—Revision of medicaid reimbursement rate.
If a receiver is appointed, the court shall set reasonable compensation for the receiver to be paid from operating revenues of the nursing home. The receiver shall be liable in his or her personal capacity only for negligent acts, intentional acts, or a breach of a fiduciary duty to either the residents of the facility or the current or former licensee or owner of the facility.

The department may revise the nursing home's medicaid reimbursement rate, consistent with reimbursement principles in chapter 74.46 RCW and rules adopted under that chapter, if revision is necessary to cover the receiver's compensation and other reasonable costs associated with the receivership and transition of control. Rate revision may also be granted if necessary to cover start-up costs and costs of repairs, replacements, and additional staff needed for patient health, security, or welfare. The property return on investment components of the medicaid rate shall be established for the receiver consistent with reimbursement principles in chapter 74.46 RCW. The department may also expedite the issuance of necessary licenses, contracts, and certifications, temporary or otherwise, necessary to carry out the purposes of receivership.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 17](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2017); \]

## 18.51.490 - Receivership—Powers of receiver.
Upon appointment of a receiver, the current or former licensee or operator and managing agent, if any, shall be divested of possession and control of the nursing home in favor of the receiver who shall have full responsibility and authority to continue operation of the home and the care of the residents. The receiver may perform all acts reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of receivership, including, but not limited to:

1. Protecting the health, security, and welfare of the residents;

2. Remedying violations of state and federal law and regulations governing the operation of the home;

3. Hiring, directing, managing, and discharging all consultants and employees for just cause; discharging the administrator of the nursing home; recognizing collective bargaining agreements; and settling labor disputes;

4. Receiving and expending in a prudent manner all revenues and financial resources of the home; and

5. Making all repairs and replacements needed for patient health, security, and welfare: PROVIDED, That expenditures for repairs or replacements in excess of five thousand dollars shall require approval of the court which shall expedite approval or disapproval for such expenditure.

Upon order of the court, a receiver may not be required to honor leases, mortgages, secured transactions, or contracts if the rent, price, or rate of interest was not a reasonable rent, price, or rate of interest at the time the contract was entered into or if a material provision of the contract is unreasonable.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 18](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2018); \]

## 18.51.500 - Receivership—Financial assistance—Use of revenues and proceeds of facility.
Upon order of the court, the department shall provide emergency or transitional financial assistance to a receiver not to exceed thirty thousand dollars. The receiver shall file with the court an accounting for any money expended. Any emergency or transitional expenditure made by the department on behalf of a nursing home not certified to participate in the Medicaid Title XIX program shall be recovered from revenue generated by the facility which revenue is not obligated to the operation of the facility. An action to recover such sums may be filed by the department against the former licensee or owner at the time the expenditure is made, regardless of whether the facility is certified to participate in the Medicaid Title XIX program or not.

In lieu of filing an action, the department may file a lien on the facility or on the proceeds of the sale of the facility. Such a lien shall take priority over all other liens except for liens for wages to employees. The owner of the facility shall be entitled to the proceeds of the facility or the sale of the facility to the extent that these exceed the liabilities of the facility, including liabilities to the state, receiver, employees, and contractors, at the termination of the receivership.

Revenues relating to services provided by the current or former licensee, operator, or owner and available operating funds belonging to such licensee, operator, or owner shall be under the control of the receiver. The receiver shall consult the court in cases of extraordinary or questionable debts incurred prior to his or her appointment and shall not have the power to close the home or sell any assets of the home without prior court approval.

Priority shall be given to debts and expenditures directly related to providing care and meeting the needs of patients. Any payment made to the receiver shall discharge the obligation of the payor to the owner of the facility.

\[ [1989 c 372 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c372.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20372%20§%204); [1987 c 476 § 19](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2019); \]

## 18.51.510 - Receivership—State medical assistance.
If the nursing home is providing care to recipients of state medical assistance, the receiver shall become the medicaid contractor for the duration of the receivership period and shall assume all reporting and other responsibilities required by applicable laws and regulations. The receiver shall be responsible for the refund of medicaid rate payments in excess of costs during the period of the receivership.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 20](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2020); \]

## 18.51.520 - Receivership—Foreclosures and seizures not allowed.
No seizure, foreclosure, or interference with nursing home revenues, supplies, real property, improvements, or equipment may be allowed for the duration of the receivership without prior court approval.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 21](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2021); \]

## 18.51.530 - Notice of change of ownership or management.
At least sixty days before the effective date of any change of ownership, change of operating entity, or change of management of a nursing home, the current operating entity shall notify separately and in writing, each resident of the home or the resident's guardian of the proposed change. The notice shall include the identity of the proposed new owner, operating entity, or managing entity and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of departmental personnel to whom comments regarding the change may be directed. If the proposed new owner, operating entity, or managing entity is a corporation, the notice shall include the names of all officers and the registered agent in the state of Washington. If the proposed new owner, operating entity, or managing entity is a partnership, the notice shall include the names of all general partners. This section shall apply regardless of whether the current operating entity holds a medicaid provider contract with the department and whether the operating entity intends to enter such a contract.

\[ [1987 c 476 § 22](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c476.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20476%20§%2022); \]

## 18.51.540 - Cost disclosure to attending physicians.
1. The legislature finds that the spiraling costs of nursing home care continue to surmount efforts to contain them, increasing at approximately twice the inflationary rate. The causes of this phenomenon are complex. By making nursing home facilities and care providers more aware of the cost consequences of care services for consumers, these providers may be inclined to exercise more restraint in providing only the most relevant and cost-beneficial services and care, with a potential for reducing the utilization of those services. The requirement of the nursing home to inform physicians, consumers, and other care providers of the charges of the services that they order may have a positive effect on containing health costs.

2. All nursing home administrators in facilities licensed under this chapter shall be required to develop and maintain a written procedure for disclosing patient charges to attending physicians with admitting privileges. The nursing home administrator shall have the capability to provide an itemized list of the charges for all health care services that may be ordered by a physician. The information shall be made available on request of consumers, or the physicians or other appropriate health care providers responsible for prescribing care.
