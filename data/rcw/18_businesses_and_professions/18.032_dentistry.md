## 18.32.002 - Findings—Purpose.
The legislature finds that the health and well-being of the people of this state are of paramount importance.

The legislature further finds that the conduct of members of the dental profession licensed to practice dentistry in this state plays a vital role in preserving the health and well-being of the people of the state.

The legislature further finds that requiring continuing dental education for all licensed dentists in the state is an important component of providing high quality dentistry for the people of this state.

The legislature further finds that there is no effective means of handling disciplinary proceedings against members of the dental profession licensed in this state when such proceedings are necessary for the protection of the public health.

Therefore, the legislature declares its intention to exercise the police power of the state to protect the public health, to promote the welfare of the state, and to provide a commission to act as a disciplinary and regulatory body for the members of the dental profession licensed to practice dentistry in this state.

It is the purpose of the commission established in RCW 18.32.0351 to regulate the competency and quality of professional health care providers under its jurisdiction by establishing, monitoring, and enforcing qualifications for licensure, continuing education, consistent standards of practice, continuing competency mechanisms, and discipline. Rules, policies, and procedures developed by the commission must promote the delivery of quality health care to the residents of the state.

## 18.32.020 - Practice of dentistry defined.
A person practices dentistry, within the meaning of this chapter, who (1) represents himself or herself as being able to diagnose, treat, remove stains and concretions from teeth, operate or prescribe for any disease, pain, injury, deficiency, deformity, or physical condition of the human teeth, alveolar process, gums, or jaw, or (2) offers or undertakes by any means or methods to diagnose, treat, remove stains or concretions from teeth, operate or prescribe for any disease, pain, injury, deficiency, deformity, or physical condition of the same, or take impressions of the teeth or jaw, or (3) owns, maintains, or operates an office for the practice of dentistry, or (4) engages in any of the practices included in the curricula of recognized and approved dental schools or colleges, or (5) professes to the public by any method to furnish, supply, construct, reproduce, or repair any prosthetic denture, bridge, appliance, or other structure to be worn in the human mouth.

The fact that a person uses any dental degree, or designation, or any card, device, directory, poster, sign, or other media whereby he or she represents himself or herself to be a dentist, shall be prima facie evidence that such person is engaged in the practice of dentistry.

X-ray diagnosis as to the method of dental practice in which the diagnosis and examination is made of the normal and abnormal structures, parts, or functions of the human teeth, the alveolar process, maxilla, mandible or soft tissues adjacent thereto, is hereby declared to be the practice of dentistry. Any person other than a regularly licensed physician or surgeon who makes any diagnosis or interpretation or explanation, or attempts to diagnose or to make any interpretation or explanation of the registered shadow or shadows of any part of the human teeth, alveolar process, maxilla, mandible or soft tissues adjacent thereto by the use of X-ray is declared to be engaged in the practice of dentistry, medicine, or surgery.

The practice of dentistry includes the performance of any dental or oral and maxillofacial surgery. "Oral and maxillofacial surgery" means the specialty of dentistry that includes the diagnosis and surgical and adjunctive treatment of diseases, injuries, and defects of the hard and soft tissues of the oral and maxillofacial region.

All persons licensed under this section shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission to the same extent as other members of the dental profession, in accordance with this chapter, and in addition the licensee may be disciplined by the commission after a hearing has been held in accordance with the provisions set forth in this chapter, and determination by the commission that such licensee has violated any of the restrictions set forth in this section.

4. Persons applying for licensure pursuant to this section shall pay the application fee determined by the secretary and, in the event the license applied for is issued, a license fee at the rate provided for licenses generally.

In any disciplinary case pertaining to a dentist where the case is resolved by agreement prior to completion of a contested hearing, the commission shall assess against the dentist a partial recovery of investigative and hearing preparation expenses in an amount as found to be reasonable reimbursement in the circumstances but no more than ten thousand dollars, unless it determines to waive this fee under the standards stated in subsection (1)(c) of this section.

4. In any stipulated informal disposition of allegations pertaining to a dentist as contemplated under RCW 18.130.172, the potential dollar limit of reimbursement of investigative and processing costs may not exceed two thousand dollars per allegation.

5. Should the dentist fail to pay any agreed reimbursement or ordered cost recovery under the statute, the commission may seek collection of the amount in the same manner as enforcement of a fine under RCW 18.130.165.

6. All fee recoveries and reimbursements under this statute must be deposited to the health professions account for the portion of it allocated to the commission. The fee recoveries shall be fully credited in reduction of actual or projected expenditures used to determine dentist license renewal fees.

7. The authority of the commission under this section is in addition to all of its authorities under RCW 18.130.160, elsewhere in chapter 18.130 RCW, or in this chapter.
