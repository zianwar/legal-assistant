   b. To protect the public interest by requiring that:

      ii. A public authority be established that is competent to prescribe and assess the qualifications of certified public accountants;

      iii. Persons other than licensees refrain from using the words "audit," "review," and "compilation" when designating a report customarily prepared by someone knowledgeable in accounting;

      iv. A public authority be established to provide for consumer alerts and public protection information to be published regarding persons or firms who violate the provisions of chapter 294, Laws of 2001 or board rule and to provide general consumer protection information to the public; and

      v. The use of accounting titles likely to confuse the public be prohibited. However as of June 30, 2024, an individual holding a CPA-inactive certificate must be designated as a licensee with an inactive status.

3. A purpose of chapter 103, Laws of 1992, revising provisions of chapter 234, Laws of 1983, is to clarify the authority of the board of accountancy with respect to the activities of persons holding certificates under this chapter. Furthermore, it is not the intent of chapter 103, Laws of 1992 to in any way restrict or limit the activities of persons not holding certificates under this chapter except as otherwise specifically restricted or limited by chapter 234, Laws of 1983.

   a. Who is of good character. Good character, for purposes of this section, means lack of a history of dishonest or felonious acts. The board may refuse to grant a license on the ground of failure to satisfy this requirement only if there is a substantial connection between the lack of good character of the applicant and the professional and ethical responsibilities of a licensee and if the finding by the board of lack of good character is supported by a preponderance of evidence. When an applicant is found to be unqualified for a license because of a lack of good character, the board shall furnish the applicant a statement containing the findings of the board and a notice of the applicant's right of appeal;

   b. Who has met the educational standards established by rule as the board determines to be appropriate;

   c. Who has passed an examination;

   d. Who has had one year of experience which is gained:

      i. Through the use of accounting, issuing reports, management advisory, financial advisory, tax, tax advisory, or consulting skills;

      iii. Meeting the competency requirements in a manner as determined by the board to be appropriate and established by board rule; and

   e. Who has paid appropriate fees as established by rule by the board.

2. The examination described in subsection (1)(c) of this section shall test the applicant's knowledge of the subjects of accounting and auditing, and other related fields the board may specify by rule. The time for holding the examination is fixed by the board and may be changed from time to time. The board shall prescribe by rule the methods of applying for and taking the examination, including methods for grading examinations and determining a passing grade required of an applicant for a license. The board shall to the extent possible see to it that the grading of the examination, and the passing grades, are uniform with those applicable to all other states. The board may make use of all or a part of the uniform certified public accountant examination and advisory grading service of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and may contract with third parties to perform administrative services with respect to the examination as the board deems appropriate to assist it in performing its duties under this chapter. The board shall establish by rule provisions for transitioning to a new examination structure or to a new media for administering the examination.

3. The board shall charge each applicant an examination fee for the initial examination or for reexamination. The applicable fee shall be paid by the person at the time he or she applies for examination, reexamination, or evaluation of educational qualifications. Fees for examination, reexamination, or evaluation of educational qualifications shall be determined by the board under this chapter. There is established in the state treasury an account to be known as the certified public accountants' account. All fees received from candidates to take any or all sections of the certified public accountant examination shall be used only for costs related to the examination.

4. Individuals whose certificates are current and valid on June 30, 2024, will automatically be converted to a licensee in an inactive status. To activate a license and become an active licensee, the individual must apply to the board to activate his or her license and must meet the following requirements:

   a. For applications to activate, the licensees must submit to the board documentation that they have gained one year of experience through the use of accounting, issuing reports, management advisory, financial advisory, tax, tax advisory, or consulting skills, without regard to the eight-year limitation set forth in (b) of this subsection, while employed in government, industry, academia, or public practice.

   b. For applications submitted to the board before January 1, 2024, the individual must provide documentation to the board that they have one year of experience acquired within eight years prior to applying for a license through the use of accounting, issuing reports, management advisory, financial advisory, tax, tax advisory, or consulting skills in government, industry, academia, or public practice.

   c. Meet competency requirements in a manner as determined by the board to be appropriate and established by board rule.

   d. Submit to the board satisfactory proof of having completed an accumulation of one hundred twenty hours of CPE during the thirty-six months preceding the date of filing the petition.

   e. Pay the appropriate fees established by rule by the board.

5. Individuals who did not hold a valid certificate on the conversion date of June 30, 2024, and who wish to apply for a license must apply as a new licensee and meet the requirements under subsection (1) of this section for initial licensure.

6. Any licensee in good standing may request to have his or her license placed on inactive status. All licensees in inactive status, including those who converted from certificate to a license, are subject to the following conditions:

   a. The licensee is prohibited from practicing public accounting;

   b. The licensee must pay a renewal fee to maintain this status;

   c. The licensee must comply with the applicable CPE requirements;

For purposes of this section, because individuals practicing using practice privileges under RCW 18.04.350(2) are deemed substantially equivalent to licensees under RCW 18.04.105 and 18.04.215, every word, term, or reference that includes the latter shall be deemed to include the former, provided the conditions of such practice privilege, as set forth in RCW 18.04.350 (4) and (5) are maintained.

11. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, it is not a violation of this section for a firm that does not hold a valid license under RCW 18.04.195 and that does not have an office in this state to use the title "CPA" or "certified public accountant" as part of the firm's name and to provide its professional services in this state, and licensees and individuals with practice privileges may provide services on behalf of such firms so long as it complies with the requirements of RCW 18.04.195(1). An individual or firm authorized under this subsection to use practice privileges in this state must comply with the requirements otherwise applicable to licensees in this section.
