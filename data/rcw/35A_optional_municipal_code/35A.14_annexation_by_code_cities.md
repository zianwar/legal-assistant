## 35A.14.085 - Election method—Vote required for annexation with assumption of indebtedness—Without assumption of indebtedness.
A code city may cause a proposition authorizing an area to be annexed to the city to be submitted to the qualified voters of the area proposed to be annexed in the same ballot proposition as the question to authorize an assumption of indebtedness. If the measures are combined, the annexation and the assumption of indebtedness shall be authorized only if the proposition is approved by at least three-fifths of the voters of the area proposed to be annexed voting on the proposition, and the number of persons voting on the proposition constitutes not less than forty percent of the total number of votes cast in the area at the last preceding general election.

However, the code city council may adopt a resolution accepting the annexation, without the assumption of indebtedness, where the combined ballot proposition is approved by a simple majority vote of the voters voting on the proposition.

Proceedings for initiating annexation of unincorporated territory to a charter code city or noncharter code city may be commenced by the filing of a petition of property owners of the territory proposed to be annexed, in the following manner.

Prior to the circulation of a petition for annexation, the initiating party or parties, who shall be the owners of not less than ten percent in value, according to the assessed valuation for general taxation of the property for which annexation is sought, shall notify the legislative body of the code city in writing of their intention to commence annexation proceedings. The legislative body shall set a date, not later than sixty days after the filing of the request, for a meeting with the initiating parties to determine whether the code city will accept, reject, or geographically modify the proposed annexation, whether it shall require the simultaneous adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, if such a proposal has been prepared and filed for the area to be annexed as provided for in RCW 35A.14.330 and 35A.14.340, and whether it shall require the assumption of all or of any portion of existing city indebtedness by the area to be annexed. If the legislative body requires the assumption of all or of any portion of indebtedness and/or the adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, it shall record this action in its minutes and the petition for annexation shall be so drawn as to clearly indicate these facts. Approval by the legislative body shall be a condition precedent to circulation of the petition. There shall be no appeal from the decision of the legislative body. A petition for annexation of an area contiguous to a code city may be filed with the legislative body of the municipality to which annexation is desired. It must be signed by the owners, as defined by RCW 35A.01.040(9) (a) through (d), of not less than sixty percent in value, according to the assessed valuation for general taxation of the property for which annexation is petitioned: PROVIDED, That a petition for annexation of an area having at least eighty percent of the boundaries of such area contiguous with a portion of the boundaries of the code city, not including that portion of the boundary of the area proposed to be annexed that is coterminous with a portion of the boundary between two counties in this state, need be signed by only the owners of not less than fifty percent in value according to the assessed valuation for general taxation of the property for which the annexation is petitioned. Such petition shall set forth a description of the property according to government legal subdivisions or legal plats and shall be accompanied by a map which outlines the boundaries of the property sought to be annexed. If the legislative body has required the assumption of all or any portion of city indebtedness by the area annexed or the adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, these facts, together with a quotation of the minute entry of such requirement, or requirements, shall also be set forth in the petition.

## 35A.14.296 - Annexation of unincorporated territory pursuant to interlocal agreement.
1. A code city as provided in subsection (2) of this section may annex unincorporated territory pursuant to an interlocal agreement. This method of annexation shall be an alternative method and is additional to all other methods provided for in this chapter.

2. The county legislative authority of a county and the governing body of a code city may jointly initiate an annexation process for unincorporated territory by adopting an interlocal agreement as provided in chapter 39.34 RCW and under this section between the county and code city within the county. If a code city is proposing to annex territory where the sole access or majority of egress and ingress for the territory proposed for annexation is served by the transportation network of an adjacent city, or that will include areas in a fire protection district under Title 52 RCW, regional fire protection service authority under chapter 52.26 RCW, water-sewer district under Title 57 RCW, or transportation benefit district under chapter 36.73 RCW, the code city must provide written notice to the governing authority of such adjacent city, regional fire protection service authority, fire protection district, water-sewer district, or transportation benefit district. Such adjacent city or notified district shall have thirty calendar days from the date of the notice to provide written notice of its interest in being a party to the interlocal agreement. If timely notice is provided, such city or district shall be included as a party to the interlocal agreement. If the adjacent city or district does not approve the interlocal agreement, the annexation may not proceed under this section. For purposes of this subsection, "adjacent" means that the territory proposed for annexation is contiguous with the existing city limits of the nonannexing city. The interlocal agreement must ensure that for a period of five years after the annexation any parcel zoned for residential development within the annexed area shall:

   a. Maintain a zoning designation that provides for residential development; and

   b. Not have its minimum gross residential density reduced below the density allowed for by the zoning designation for that parcel prior to annexation.

3. The county and code city shall jointly agree on the boundaries of the annexation and its effective date. The interlocal agreement shall describe the boundaries of the territory to be annexed and set a date for a public hearing on such agreement for annexation. An interlocal agreement may include phased annexation of territory, and may be amended following the same process as initial approval, including adding additional territory. A public hearing shall be held by each legislative body, separately or jointly, before the agreement is executed. Each legislative body holding a public hearing shall:

   a. Separately or jointly, publish a notice of availability of the agreement at least once a week for four weeks before the date of the hearing in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the code city and one or more newspapers of general circulation within the territory proposed for annexation; and

   b. If the legislative body has the ability to do so, post the notice of availability of the agreement on its website for the same four weeks that the notice is published in the newspapers under (a) of this subsection. The notice shall describe where the public may review the agreement and the territory to be annexed.

4. On the date set for hearing, the public shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard. Following the hearing, if the legislative body determines to effect the annexation, they shall do so by ordinance. If the annexation agreement includes phased annexation of territory, the legislative body shall adopt a separate ordinance at the time of each phase of annexation. Upon the date fixed in the ordinance of annexation the area annexed shall become part of the city. If the annexation ordinance provides for assumption of indebtedness or adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, the notice shall include a statement of such requirements. Upon passage of the annexation ordinance a certified copy shall be filed with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the annexed property is located.

## 35A.14.297 - Ordinance providing for annexation of unincorporated island of territory—Referendum.
On the date set for hearing as provided in RCW 35A.14.295, residents or property owners of the area included in the resolution for annexation shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard. The legislative body may provide by ordinance for annexation of the territory described in the resolution, but the effective date of the ordinance shall be not less than forty-five days after the passage thereof. The legislative body shall cause notice of the proposed effective date of the annexation, together with a description of the property to be annexed, to be published at least once each week for two weeks subsequent to passage of the ordinance, in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the city and in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the area to be annexed. If the annexation ordinance provides for assumption of indebtedness or adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, the notice shall include a statement of such requirements. Such annexation ordinance shall be subject to referendum for forty-five days after the passage thereof. Upon the filing of a timely and sufficient referendum petition as provided in RCW 35A.14.299 below, a referendum election shall be held as provided in RCW 35A.14.299, and the annexation shall be deemed approved by the voters unless a majority of the votes cast on the proposition are in opposition thereto. After the expiration of the forty-fifth day from, but excluding the date of passage of the annexation ordinance, if no timely and sufficient referendum petition has been filed, as provided by RCW 35A.14.299 below, the area annexed shall become a part of the code city upon the date fixed in the ordinance of annexation.

Notice of such election shall be given as provided in RCW 35A.14.070 and the election shall be conducted as provided in RCW 35A.29.151. The annexation shall be deemed approved by the voters unless a majority of the votes cast on the proposition are in opposition thereto.

After the expiration of the forty-fifth day from but excluding the date of passage of the annexation ordinance, if no timely and sufficient referendum petition has been filed, the area annexed shall become a part of the code city upon the date fixed in the ordinance of annexation. From and after such date, if the ordinance so provided, property in the annexed area shall be subject to the proposed zoning regulation prepared and filed for such area as provided in RCW 35A.14.330 and 35A.14.340. If the ordinance so provided, all property within the area annexed shall be assessed and taxed at the same rate and on the same basis as the property of such annexing code city is assessed and taxed to pay for any then outstanding indebtedness of such city contracted prior to, or existing at, the date of annexation.

## 35A.14.310 - Annexation of federal areas.
A code city may annex an unincorporated area contiguous to the city that is owned by the federal government by adopting an ordinance providing for the annexation and which ordinance either acknowledges an agreement of the annexation by the government of the United States, or accepts a gift, grant, or lease from the government of the United States of the right to occupy, control, improve it or sublet it for commercial, manufacturing, or industrial purposes: PROVIDED, That this right of annexation shall not apply to any territory more than four miles from the corporate limits existing before such annexation. Whenever a code city proposes to annex territory under this section, the city shall provide written notice of the proposed annexation to the legislative authority of the county within which such territory is located. The notice shall be provided at least thirty days before the city proposes to adopt the annexation ordinance. The city shall not adopt the annexation ordinance, and the annexation shall not occur under this section, if within twenty-five days of receipt of the notice, the county legislative authority adopts a resolution opposing the annexation, which resolution makes a finding that the proposed annexation will have an adverse fiscal impact on the county or road district.

In the event that any person, firm or corporation whose franchise or permit has been canceled by the terms of this section shall suffer any measurable damages as a result of any annexation pursuant to the provisions of the laws above mentioned, such person, firm or corporation shall have a right of action against any code city causing such damages.

After an annexation by a code city, the utilities and transportation commission shall continue to regulate solid waste collection within the limits of the annexed territory until such time as the city notifies the commission, in writing, of its decision to contract for solid waste collection or provide solid waste collection itself pursuant to RCW 81.77.020. In the event the annexing city at any time decides to contract for solid waste collection or decides to undertake solid waste collection itself, the holder of any such franchise or permit that is so canceled in whole or in part shall be forthwith granted by the annexing city a franchise to continue such business within the annexed territory for a term of not less than the remaining term of the original franchise or permit, or not less than seven years, whichever is the shorter period, and the city, by franchise, permit, or public operation, shall not extend similar or competing services to the annexed territory except upon a proper showing of the inability or refusal of such person, firm, or corporation to adequately service the annexed territory at a reasonable price. Upon the effective date specified by the code city council's ordinance or resolution to have the code city contract for solid waste collection or undertake solid waste collection itself, the transition period specified in this section begins to run. This section does not preclude the purchase by the annexing city of the franchise, business, or facilities at an agreed or negotiated price, or from acquiring the same by condemnation upon payment of damages, including a reasonable amount for the loss of the franchise or permit. In the event that any person, firm, or corporation whose franchise or permit has been canceled by the terms of this section suffers any measurable damages as a result of any annexation pursuant to this chapter, such person, firm, or corporation has a right of action against any city causing such damages.
