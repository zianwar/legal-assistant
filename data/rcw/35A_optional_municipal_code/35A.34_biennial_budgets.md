## 35A.34.200 - Funds—Limitations on expenditures—Transfers and adjustments.
1. The expenditures as classified and itemized in the final budget shall constitute the city's appropriations for the ensuing fiscal biennium. Unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, and subject to further limitations imposed by ordinance of the city, the expenditure of city funds or the incurring of current liabilities on behalf of the city shall be limited to the following:

   a. The total amount appropriated for each fund in the budget for the current fiscal biennium, without regard to the individual items contained therein, except that this limitation does not apply to wage adjustments authorized by RCW 35A.34.180;

Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 43.09.210 or of any statute to the contrary, transfers, as authorized in this section, may be made within the same fund regardless of the various offices, departments, or divisions of the city which may be affected.

3. The city legislative body, upon a finding that it is to the best interests of the city to decrease, revoke, or recall all or any portion of the total appropriations provided for any one fund, may, by ordinance, approved by the vote of one more than the majority of all members thereof, stating the facts and findings for doing so, decrease, revoke, or recall all or any portion of an unexpended fund balance, and by said ordinance, or a subsequent ordinance adopted by a like majority, the moneys thus released may be reappropriated for another purpose or purposes, without limitation to department, division, or fund, unless the use of such moneys is otherwise restricted by law, charter, or ordinance.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 52](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2052); \]

## 35A.34.210 - Liabilities incurred in excess of budget.
Liabilities incurred by any officer or employee of the city in excess of any budget appropriations shall not be a liability of the city. The clerk shall issue no warrant and the city legislative body or other authorized person shall approve no claim for an expenditure in excess of the total amount appropriated for any individual fund, except upon an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or for emergencies as provided in this chapter.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 53](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2053); \]

## 35A.34.220 - Funds received from sales of bonds and warrants—Expenditures program—Federal tax law.
Moneys received from the sale of bonds or warrants must be used for no other purpose than that for which they were issued.

Where a budget contains an expenditure program to be partially or wholly financed from a bond issue to be authorized thereafter, expenditures of amounts anticipated to be reimbursed from the proceeds of the issuance and sale of such bonds must be made or incurred consistent with any applicable federal tax law requirements.

## 35A.34.240 - Funds—Quarterly report of status.
At such intervals as may be required by city charter or city ordinance, however, being not less than quarterly, the clerk shall submit to the city's legislative body and chief administrative officer a report showing the expenditures and liabilities against each separate budget appropriation incurred during the preceding reporting period and like information for the whole of the current fiscal biennium to the first day of the current reporting period together with the unexpended balance of each appropriation.

## 35A.34.250 - Contingency fund—Creation.
Every city may create and maintain a contingency fund to provide moneys with which to meet any municipal expense, the necessity or extent of which could not have been foreseen or reasonably evaluated at the time of adopting the annual budget, or from which to provide moneys for those emergencies described in RCW 35A.34.140 and 35A.34.150. Such fund may be supported by a budget appropriation from any tax or other revenue source not restricted in use by law, or also may be supported by a transfer from other unexpended or decreased funds made available by ordinance as set forth in RCW 35A.34.200. However, the total amount accumulated in such fund at any time shall not exceed the equivalent of thirty-seven and one-half cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation of property within the city at such time. Any moneys in the emergency fund at the end of the fiscal biennium shall not lapse except upon reappropriation by the council to another fund in the adoption of a subsequent budget.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 57](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2057); \]

## 35A.34.260 - Contingency fund—Withdrawals.
No money shall be withdrawn from the contingency fund except by transfer to the appropriate operating fund authorized by a resolution or ordinance of the legislative body of the city, adopted by a majority vote of the entire legislative body, clearly stating the facts constituting the reason for the withdrawal or the emergency as the case may be, specifying the fund to which the withdrawn money shall be transferred.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 58](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2058); \]

## 35A.34.270 - Unexpended appropriations.
All appropriations in any current operating fund shall lapse at the end of each fiscal biennium. However, this shall not prevent payments in the following biennium upon uncompleted programs or improvements in progress or on orders subsequently filled or claims subsequently billed for the purchase of material, equipment, and supplies or for personal or contractual services not completed or furnished by the end of the fiscal biennium, all of which have been properly budgeted and contracted for prior to the close of such fiscal biennium, but furnished or completed in due course thereafter.

All appropriations in a special fund authorized by ordinance or by state law to be used only for the purpose or purposes therein specified, including any cumulative reserve funds lawfully established in specific or general terms for any municipal purpose or purposes, or a contingency fund as authorized by RCW 35A.34.250, shall not lapse, but shall be carried forward from biennium to biennium until fully expended or the purpose has been accomplished or abandoned, without necessity of reappropriation.

The accounts for budgetary control for each fiscal biennium shall be kept open for twenty days after the close of such fiscal biennium for the purpose of paying and recording claims for indebtedness incurred during such fiscal biennium; any claim presented after the twentieth day following the close of the fiscal biennium shall be paid from appropriations lawfully provided for the ensuing period, including those made available by provisions of this section, and shall be recorded in the accounts for the ensuing fiscal biennium.

\[ [1985 c 175 § 59](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2059); \]

\[ [1985 c 175 § 60](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c175.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20175%20§%2060); \]
