## 35A.63.110 - Board of adjustment—Creation—Powers and duties.
A code city which pursuant to this chapter creates a planning agency and which has twenty-five hundred or more inhabitants, by ordinance, shall create a board of adjustment and provide for its membership, terms of office, organization, jurisdiction. A code city which pursuant to this chapter creates a planning agency and which has a population of less than twenty-five hundred may, by ordinance, similarly create a board of adjustment. In the event a code city with a population of less than twenty-five hundred creates a planning agency, but does not create a board of adjustment, the code city shall provide that the city legislative authority shall itself hear and decide the items listed in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this section. The action of the board of adjustment shall be final and conclusive, unless, within twenty-one days from the date of the action, the original applicant or an adverse party makes application to the superior court for the county in which that city is located for a writ of certiorari, a writ of prohibition, or a writ of mandamus. No member of the board of adjustment shall be a member of the planning agency or the legislative body. Subject to conditions, safeguards, and procedures provided by ordinance, the board of adjustment may be empowered to hear and decide:

1. Appeals from orders, recommendations, permits, decisions, or determinations made by a code city official in the administration or enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or any ordinances adopted pursuant to it.

2. Applications for variances from the terms of the zoning ordinance, the official map ordinance or other land-use regulatory ordinances under procedures and conditions prescribed by city ordinance, which among other things shall provide that no application for a variance shall be granted unless the board of adjustment finds:

   a. The variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property on behalf of which the application was filed is located; and

   b. That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located; and

   c. That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated.

3. Applications for conditional-use permits, unless such applications are to be heard and decided by the planning agency. A conditional use means a use listed among those classified in any given zone but permitted to locate only after review as herein provided in accordance with standards and criteria set forth in the zoning ordinance.

4. Such other quasi-judicial and administrative determinations as may be delegated by ordinance.

In deciding any of the matters referred to in subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the board of adjustment shall issue a written report giving the reasons for its decision. If a code city provides for a hearing examiner and vests in him or her the authority to hear and decide the items listed in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this section pursuant to RCW 35A.63.170, then the provisions of this section shall not apply to such a city.

## 35A.63.170 - Hearing examiner system—Adoption authorized—Alternative—Functions—Procedures.
1. As an alternative to those provisions of this chapter relating to powers or duties of the planning commission to hear and report on any proposal to amend a zoning ordinance, the legislative body of a city may adopt a hearing examiner system under which a hearing examiner or hearing examiners may hear and decide applications for amending the zoning ordinance when the amendment which is applied for is not of general applicability.

Such findings and conclusions shall also set forth the manner in which the decision would carry out and conform to the city's comprehensive plan and the city's development regulations. Each final decision of a hearing examiner, unless a longer period is mutually agreed to in writing by the applicant and the hearing examiner, shall be rendered within ten working days following conclusion of all testimony and hearings.

A city may require that the facility: (a) Comply with all building, fire, safety, health code, and business licensing requirements; (b) conform to lot size, building size, setbacks, and lot coverage standards applicable to the zoning district except if the structure is a legal nonconforming structure; (c) is certified by the department of children, youth, and families licensor as providing a safe passenger loading area; (d) include signage, if any, that conforms to applicable regulations; and (e) limit hours of operations to facilitate neighborhood compatibility, while also providing appropriate opportunity for persons who use family day-care and who work a nonstandard work shift.

3. A city may also require that the family day-care provider, before state licensing, require proof of written notification by the provider that the immediately adjoining property owners have been informed of the intent to locate and maintain such a facility. If a dispute arises between neighbors and the family day-care provider over licensing requirements, the licensor may provide a forum to resolve the dispute.

4. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a city from imposing zoning conditions on the establishment and maintenance of a family day-care provider's home in an area zoned for residential or commercial use, so long as such conditions are no more restrictive than conditions imposed on other residential dwellings in the same zone and the establishment of such facilities is not precluded.
