## 35A.08.010 - Adoption of charter authorized.
Any city having a population of ten thousand or more inhabitants may become a charter code city and be governed under the provisions of this title by adopting a charter for its own government in the manner prescribed in this chapter. Once any city, having ten thousand population, has adopted such a charter, any subsequent decrease in population below ten thousand shall not affect its status as a charter code city.

\[ [1967 ex.s. c 119 § 35A.08.010](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967ex1c119.pdf?cite=1967%20ex.s.%20c%20119%20§%2035A.08.010); \]

## 35A.08.020 - Determining population.
For the purposes of this chapter, the population of a city shall be the number of residents shown by the figures released for the most recent official state or federal census, by a population determination made under the direction of the office of financial management, or by a city census conducted in the following manner:

1. The legislative authority of any such city may provide by ordinance for the appointment by the mayor thereof, of such number of persons as may be designated in the ordinance to make an enumeration of all persons residing within the corporate limits of the city. The enumerators so appointed, before entering upon their duties, shall take an oath for the faithful performance thereof and within five days after their appointment proceed, within their respective districts, to make an enumeration of all persons residing therein, with their names and places of residence.

2. Immediately upon the completion of the enumeration, the enumerators shall make return thereof upon oath to the legislative authority of the city, who at its next meeting or as soon thereafter as practicable, shall canvass and certify the returns.

3. If it appears therefrom that the whole number of persons residing within the corporate limits of the city is ten thousand or more, the mayor and clerk under the corporate seal of the city shall certify the number so ascertained to the secretary of state, who shall file it in his or her office. This certificate when so filed shall be conclusive evidence of the population of the city.

## 35A.08.030 - Resolution or petition for election.
The legislative body of any city having ten thousand or more inhabitants may, by resolution, provide for submission to the voters of the question whether the city shall become a charter code city and be governed in accordance with a charter to be adopted by the voters under the provisions of this title. The legislative body must provide for such an election upon receipt of a sufficient petition therefor signed by qualified electors in number equal to not less than ten percent of the votes cast at the last general municipal election therein. The question may be submitted to the voters at the next general municipal election if one is to be held within one hundred and eighty days or at a special election held for that purpose not less than ninety nor more than one hundred and eighty days after the passage of the resolution or the filing of the certificate of sufficiency of the petition. At such election provision shall also be made for the election of fifteen freeholders who, upon a favorable vote on the question, shall constitute the charter commission charged with the duty of framing a charter for submission to the voters. If the vote in favor of adopting a charter receives forty percent or less of the total vote on the question of charter adoption, no new election on the question of charter adoption may be held for a period of two years from the date of the election in which the charter proposal failed.

A nominating petition shall be filed within the time allowed for filing declarations of candidacy and shall be verified by an affidavit of one or more of the signers to the effect that the affiant believes that the candidate and all of the signers are registered voters of the city and he or she signed the petition in good faith for the purpose of endorsing the person named therein for election to the charter commission. A written acceptance of the nomination by the nominee shall be affixed to the petition when filed with the county auditor. Nominating petitions need not be in the form prescribed in RCW 35A.01.040.

In the event of a vacancy in the charter commission, the remaining members shall fill it by appointment thereto of some properly qualified person. A majority shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business but final charter recommendations shall require a majority vote of the whole membership of the commission. The commission shall study the plan of government of the city, compare it with other available plans of government, and determine whether, in its judgment, the government of the city could be strengthened, made more responsive or accountable to the people, or whether its operation could be made more economical or more efficient by amendment of the existing plan or adoption of another plan of government. The commission shall consider the plans of government described in this title but shall not be limited to such plans in its recommendations for the government of the city and may frame a charter for any plan it deems suitable for the good government of the city; except that the provisions of such charter shall not be valid if inconsistent with the Constitution of this state, the provisions of this title, or the general laws of the state, insofar as they are applicable to cities governed under this title.
