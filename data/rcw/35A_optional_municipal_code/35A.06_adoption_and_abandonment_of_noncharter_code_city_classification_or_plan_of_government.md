## 35A.06.010 - Each optional plan of government declared complete form of government.
Each of the optional plans of government authorized by chapter 35A.12 RCW and chapter 35A.13 RCW, with any amendments thereto, is declared to be a complete and separate plan of government authorized by the legislature for submission to the voters of a municipality or for adoption by resolution of the legislative body thereof in the manner provided herein, and is additional to the plans of government existing prior to the time this title takes effect.

\[ [1967 ex.s. c 119 § 35A.06.010](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967ex1c119.pdf?cite=1967%20ex.s.%20c%20119%20§%2035A.06.010); \]

## 35A.06.020 - Laws applicable to noncharter code cities.
The classifications of municipalities as first-class cities, second-class cities, unclassified cities, and towns, and the restrictions, limitations, duties, and obligations specifically imposed by law upon such classes of cities and towns, shall have no application to noncharter code cities, but every noncharter code city, by adopting such classification, has elected to be governed by the provisions of this title, with the powers granted hereby. However, any code city that retains its old plan of government is subject to the laws applicable to that old plan of government until the city abandons its old plan of government and reorganizes and adopts a plan of government under chapter 35A.12 or 35A.13 RCW.

## 35A.06.030 - Abandonment of plan of government of a noncharter code city.
By use of the resolution for election or petition for election methods described in RCW 35A.06.040, any noncharter code city which has operated for more than six consecutive years under one of the optional plans of government authorized by this title, or for more than a combined total of six consecutive years under a particular plan of government both as a code city and under the same general plan under Title 35 RCW immediately prior to becoming a code city, may abandon such organization and may reorganize and adopt another plan of government authorized for noncharter code cities, but only after having been a noncharter code city for more than one year or a city after operating for more than six consecutive years under a particular plan of government as a noncharter code city: PROVIDED, That these limitations shall not apply to a city seeking to adopt a charter.

In reorganization under a different general plan of government as a noncharter code city, officers shall serve the remainder of their terms. If a city with a mayor-council plan of government is reorganized with a council-manager plan of government, the mayor shall serve as a councilmember for the remainder of his or her term. If a city with a council-manager plan of government is reorganized with a mayor-council plan of government, the mayor shall be elected as provided in RCW 35A.02.050. When a noncharter code city adopts a plan of government other than those authorized under Title 35A RCW, such city ceases to be governed under this optional municipal code, shall be classified as a city or town of the class selected in the proceeding for adoption of such new plan, with the powers granted to such class under the general law, and shall elect officers as provided in RCW 35A.02.050.
