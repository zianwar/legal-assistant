Such contracts shall include but are not limited to the following terms and conditions:

1. Historic shipwrecks:

   a. The contract shall provide for fair compensation to a salvor. "Fair compensation" means an amount not less than ninety percent of the appraised value of the objects recovered following successful completion of the contract.

   b. The salvor may retain objects with a value of up to ninety percent of the appraised value of the total objects recovered, or cash, or a combination of objects and cash. In no event may the total of objects and cash exceed ninety percent of the total appraised value of the objects recovered. A salvor shall not be entitled to further compensation from any state sources.

   c. The contract shall provide that the state will be given first choice of which objects it may wish to retain for display purposes for the people of the state from among all the objects recovered. The state may retain objects with a value of up to ten percent of the appraised value of the total objects recovered. If the state chooses not to retain recovered objects with a value of up to ten percent of the appraised value, the state shall be entitled to receive its share in cash or a combination of recovered objects and cash so long as the state's total share does not exceed ten percent of the appraised value of the objects recovered.

   d. The contract shall provide that both the state and the salvor shall have the right to select a single appraiser or joint appraisers.

   e. The contract shall also provide that title to the objects shall pass to the salvor when the permit is issued. However, should the salvor fail to fully perform under the terms of the contract, title to all objects recovered shall revert to the state.

2. Historic aircraft:

   a. The contract shall provide that historic aircraft belonging to the state of Washington may only be recovered if the purpose of that salvage operation is to recover the aircraft for a museum, historical society, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity.

   b. Title to the aircraft may only be passed by the state to one of the entities listed in (a) of this subsection.

   c. Compensation to the salvor shall only be derived from the sale or exchange of the aircraft to one of the entities listed in (a) of this subsection or such other compensation as one of the entities listed in (a) of this subsection and the salvor may arrange. The salvor shall not have a claim to compensation from state funds.

3. Other historic archaeological resources: The director, in his or her discretion, may negotiate the terms of such contracts.

## 27.53.120 - Recovery of property from historic archaeological sites—Mitigation of damage—Refusal to issue salvage permit to prevent destruction of resource.
The salvor shall agree to mitigate any archaeological damage which occurs during the salvage operation. The department shall have access to all property recovered from historic archaeological sites for purposes of scholarly research and photographic documentation for a period to be agreed upon by the parties following completion of the salvage operation. The department shall also have the right to publish scientific papers concerning the results of all research conducted as project mitigation.

The director has the right to refuse to issue a permit for salvaging an historic archaeological resource if that resource would be destroyed beyond mitigation by the proposed salvage operation. Any agency, institution, person, firm, or corporation which has been denied a permit because the resource would be destroyed beyond mitigation by their method of salvage shall have a right of first refusal for that permit at a future date should technology be found which would make salvage possible without destroying the resource. Such right of first refusal shall be in effect for sixty days after the director has determined that salvage can be accomplished by a subsequent applicant without destroying the resource.

No person, firm, or corporation may conduct such salvage or recovery operation herein described without first obtaining such contract.
