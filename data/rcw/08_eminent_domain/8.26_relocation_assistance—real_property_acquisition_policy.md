1. The purposes of this chapter are:

   a. To establish a uniform policy for the fair and equitable treatment of persons displaced as a direct result of public works programs of the state and local governments in order that such persons shall not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole and to minimize the hardship of displacement on such persons;

   b. To encourage and expedite the acquisition of real property for public works programs by agreements with owners, to reduce litigation and relieve congestion in the courts, to assure consistent treatment for owners affected by state and local programs, and to promote public confidence in state and local land acquisition practices;

   c. To require the state, local public agencies, and other persons who have the authority to acquire property by eminent domain under state law to comply with the provisions of chapter 213, Laws of 2017 in order to assure the fair and equitable treatment of all persons and property owners impacted by public projects.

2. Any determination by the head of a state agency or local public agency administering a program or project as to payments under this chapter is subject to review pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW; otherwise, no provision of this chapter may be construed to give any person a cause of action in any court.

3. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, any state or local public agency providing a grant, loan, or matching funds for any program or project that displaces persons who are eligible for relocation assistance under this chapter may not limit, restrict, or otherwise prohibit grant, loan, or matching fund money from being used for any required relocation assistance payments.

4. The governing body of any local public agency may elect not to comply with the provisions of RCW 8.26.035 through 8.26.115 in connection with a program or project not receiving federal financial assistance initiated on or before December 31, 2017.

5. Nothing in this chapter may be construed as creating in any condemnation proceedings brought under the power of eminent domain, any element of value or of damage not in existence immediately before March 16, 1988.

\[ [1988 c 90 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c90.pdf?cite=1988%20c%2090%20§%206); \]

## 8.26.075 - Assurance of availability of housing—Exceptions.
1. If a program or project undertaken by a displacing agency cannot proceed on a timely basis because comparable replacement dwellings are not available, and the head of the displacing agency determines that the dwellings cannot otherwise be made available, the head of the displacing agency may take such action as is necessary or appropriate to provide the dwellings by use of funds authorized for the project. The displacing agency may use this section to exceed the maximum amounts that may be paid under RCW 8.26.045 and 8.26.055 on a case-by-case basis for good cause as determined in accordance with rules adopted by the lead agency.

2. No person may be required to move from a dwelling on account of any program or project undertaken by a displacing agency unless the displacing agency is satisfied that comparable replacement housing is available to the person.

## 8.26.180 - Acquisition procedures.
Every acquiring agency shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be guided by the following policies:

1. Every reasonable effort shall be made to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation.

2. Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his or her designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany at least one appraiser of the acquiring agency during his or her inspection of the property, except that the lead agency may prescribe a procedure to waive the appraisal in cases involving the acquisition of property with a low fair market value.

3. Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, the acquiring agency shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation therefor, and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. In no event shall such amount be less than the agency's approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property. Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of the real property to be acquired prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which such property is acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for such improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The acquiring agency shall provide the owner of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount it established as just compensation. Where appropriate the just compensation for the real property acquired, for damages to remaining real property, and for benefits to remaining real property shall be separately stated.

4. No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the agreed purchase price is paid or deposited with a court having jurisdiction of condemnation of such property, in accordance with applicable law, for the benefit of the owner an amount not less than the acquiring agency's approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding of such property.

5. The construction or development of a public improvement shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling or to move his or her business or farm operation without at least ninety days written notice of the date by which such move is required.

6. If an owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination on short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.

7. In no event shall the time of condemnation be advanced, *on negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner be deferred, or any other coercive action be taken to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.

8. If an interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, formal condemnation proceedings shall be instituted. The acquiring agency shall not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his or her real property.

9. If the acquisition of only a portion of a property would leave the owner with an uneconomic remnant, the head of the agency concerned shall offer to acquire that remnant. For the purposes of this chapter, an uneconomic remnant is a parcel of real property in which the owner is left with an interest after the partial acquisition of the owner's property and that the head of the agency concerned has determined has little or no value or utility.

10. A person whose real property is being acquired in accordance with this chapter may, after the person has been fully informed of his or her right to receive just compensation for the property, donate the property, any part thereof, any interest therein, or any compensation paid for it to any agency as the person may determine.

## 8.26.190 - Acquisition of buildings, structures, and improvements.
1. Where any interest in real property is acquired, the acquiring agency shall acquire an equal interest in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real property so acquired and which is required to be removed from such real property or which is determined to be adversely affected by the use to which such real property will be put.

2. For the purpose of determining the just compensation to be paid for any building, structure, or other improvement required to be acquired under subsection (1) of this section, such building, structure, or other improvement shall be deemed to be a part of the real property to be acquired notwithstanding the right or obligation of a tenant of the lands, as against the owner of any other interest in the real property, to remove such building, structure, or improvement at the expiration of his or her term, and the fair market value which such building, structure, or improvement contributes to the fair market value of the real property to be acquired, or the fair market value of such building, structure, or improvement for removal from the real property, whichever is the greater, shall be paid to the owner of such building, structure, or improvement.

3. Payment for such building, structure, or improvement under subsection (1) of this section shall not result in duplication of any payments otherwise authorized by state law. No such payment shall be made unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant. In consideration for any such payment, the tenant shall assign, transfer, and release all his or her right, title, and interest in and to such improvements. Nothing with regard to the above mentioned acquisition of buildings, structures, or other improvements shall be construed to deprive the tenant of any rights to reject payment and to obtain payment for such property interests in accordance with other laws of this state.
