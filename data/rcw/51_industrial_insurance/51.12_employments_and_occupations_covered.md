The contractor and any subcontractor are subject to the provisions of this title and the person, firm, or corporation letting the contract is entitled to collect from the contractor the full amount payable in premiums and the contractor in turn is entitled to collect from the subcontractor his or her proportionate amount of the payment.

1. For the purposes of this section, a contractor registered under chapter 18.27 RCW or licensed under chapter 19.28 RCW is not responsible for any premiums upon the work of any subcontractor if:

   a. The subcontractor is currently engaging in a business which is registered under chapter 18.27 RCW or licensed under chapter 19.28 RCW;

   b. The subcontractor has a principal place of business which would be eligible for a business deduction for internal revenue service tax purposes other than that furnished by the contractor for which the business has contracted to furnish services;

   c. The subcontractor maintains a separate set of books or records that reflect all items of income and expenses of the business;

   d. The subcontractor has contracted to perform:

      i. The work of a contractor as defined in RCW 18.27.010; or

      ii. The work of installing wires or equipment to convey electric current or installing apparatus to be operated by such current as it pertains to the electrical industry as described in chapter 19.28 RCW; and

   e. The subcontractor has an industrial insurance account in good standing with the department or is a self-insurer. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(e), a contractor may consider a subcontractor's account to be in good standing if, within a year prior to letting the contract or master service agreement, and at least once a year thereafter, the contractor has verified with the department that the account is in good standing and the contractor has not received written notice from the department that the subcontractor's account status has changed. Acceptable documentation of verification includes a department document which includes an issued date or a dated printout of information from the department's internet website showing a subcontractor's good standing. The department shall develop an approach to provide contractors with verification of the date of inquiries validating that the subcontractor's account is in good standing.

It is unlawful for any county, city, or town to issue a construction building permit to any person who has not submitted to the department an estimate of payroll and paid premium thereon as provided by chapter 51.16 RCW of this title or proof of qualification as a self-insurer.

2. Nonemergency transportation brokers that operate as not-for-profit businesses are not liable for any premiums of a subcontractor if the provisions of subsection (1)(c) and (e) of this section are met throughout the term of the contract. For purposes of this section, nonemergency transportation brokers are those organizations or entities that contract with the state health care authority, or its successor, to arrange nonemergency transportation for qualified clients.

## 51.12.102 - Maritime workers—Asbestos-related disease.
1. The department shall furnish the benefits provided under this title to any worker or beneficiary who may have a right or claim for benefits under the maritime laws of the United States resulting from an asbestos-related disease if (a) there are objective clinical findings to substantiate that the worker has an asbestos-related claim for occupational disease and (b) the worker's employment history has a prima facie indicia of injurious exposure to asbestos fibers while employed in the state of Washington in employment covered under this title. The department shall render a decision as to the liable insurer and shall continue to pay benefits until the liable insurer initiates payments or benefits are otherwise properly terminated under this title.

2. The benefits authorized under subsection (1) of this section shall be paid from the medical aid fund, with the self-insurers and the state fund each paying a pro rata share, based on number of worker hours, of the costs necessary to fund the payments. For the purposes of this subsection only, the employees of self-insured employers shall pay an amount equal to one-half of the share charged to the self-insured employer.

3. If the department determines that the benefits paid under subsection (1) of this section are owed to the worker or beneficiary by a self-insurer or the state fund, then the self-insurer or state fund shall reimburse the medical aid fund for all benefits paid and costs incurred by the fund.

4. If the department determines that the benefits paid under subsection (1) of this section are owed to the worker or beneficiary by a federal program other than the federal social security, old age survivors, and disability insurance act, 42 U.S.C. or an insurer under the maritime laws of the United States:

   a. The department shall pursue the federal program insurer on behalf of the worker or beneficiary to recover from the federal program insurer the benefits due the worker or beneficiary and on its own behalf to recover the benefits previously paid to the worker or beneficiary and costs incurred;

   b. For the purpose of pursuing recovery under this subsection, the department shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the worker or beneficiary receiving compensation under subsection (1) of this section; and

   c. The department shall not pursue the worker or beneficiary for the recovery of benefits paid under subsection (1) of this section unless the worker or beneficiary receives recovery from the federal program insurer, in addition to receiving benefits authorized under this section. The director may exercise his or her discretion to waive, in whole or in part, the recovery of any such benefits where the recovery would be against equity and good conscience.

   d. Actions pursued against federal program insurers determined by the department to be liable for benefits under this section may be prosecuted by special assistant attorneys general. The attorney general shall select special assistant attorneys general from a list compiled by the department and the Washington state bar association. The attorney general, in conjunction with the department and the Washington state bar association, shall adopt rules and regulations outlining the criteria and the procedure by which private attorneys may have their names placed on the list of attorneys available for appointment as special assistant attorneys general to litigate actions under this subsection. Attorneys' fees and costs shall be paid in conformity with applicable federal and state law. Any legal costs remaining as an obligation of the department shall be paid from the medical aid fund.

5. The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply if the worker or beneficiary refuses, for whatever reason, to assist the department in making a proper determination of coverage. If a worker or beneficiary refuses to cooperate with the department, self-insurer, or federal program insurer by failing to provide information that, in the opinion of the department, is relevant in determining the liable insurer, or if a worker refuses to submit to medical examination, or obstructs or fails to cooperate with the examination, or if the worker or beneficiary fails to cooperate with the department in pursuing benefits from the federal program insurer, the department shall reject the application for benefits. No information obtained under this section is subject to release by subpoena or other legal process.

6. The amount of any third party recovery by the worker or beneficiary shall be subject to a lien by the department to the full extent that the medical aid fund has not been otherwise reimbursed by another insurer. Reimbursement shall be made immediately to the medical aid fund upon recovery from the third party suit. If the department determines that the benefits paid under subsection (1) of this section are owed to the worker or beneficiary by a federal program insurer, the department shall not participate in the costs or attorneys' fees incurred in bringing the third party suit.

The employer shall, at least thirty days before the effective date of the withdrawal, post reasonable notice of such withdrawal where the affected worker or workers work and shall otherwise notify personally the affected workers. Withdrawal of acceptance of this title shall not affect the liability of the department or self-insurer for compensation for any injury occurring during the period of acceptance.

The department shall have the power to cancel the elective adoption coverage if any required payments or reports have not been made. Cancellation by the department shall be no later than thirty days from the date of notice in writing by the department advising of cancellation being made.

If the employer is a self-insurer under the workers' compensation law of the other state or province of Canada, the employer shall, upon submission of evidence or security, satisfactory to the director, of his or her ability to meet his or her liability to the claimant under this title, be deemed to be a qualified self-insurer under this title; and

      iv. If the employer's liability under the workers' compensation law of the other state or province of Canada is insured:

          A.  The employer's carrier, as to such claimant only, shall be deemed to be subject to this title. However, unless the insurer's contract with the employer requires the insurer to pay an amount equivalent to the compensation benefits provided by this title, the insurer's liability for compensation shall not exceed the insurer's liability under the workers' compensation law of the other state or province; and

          B.  If the total amount for which the employer's insurer is liable under (b)(iv)(A) of this subsection is less than the total of the compensation to which the claimant is entitled under this title, the director may require the employer to file security satisfactory to the director to secure the payment of compensation under this title.

   c. If subject to subsection (3) of this section, has not complied with subsection (3) of this section or, if not subject to subsection (3) of this section, has neither qualified as a self-insurer nor secured insurance coverage under the workers' compensation law of another state or province of Canada, the claimant shall be paid compensation by the department and the employer shall have the same rights and obligations, and is subject to the same penalties, as other employers subject to this title.

5. As used in this section:

   a. A person's employment is principally localized in this or another state when: (i) His or her employer has a place of business in this or the other state and he or she regularly works at or from the place of business; or (ii) if (a)(i) of this subsection is not applicable, he or she is domiciled in and spends a substantial part of his or her working time in the service of his or her employer in this or the other state;

   b. "Workers' compensation law" includes "occupational disease law" for the purposes of this section.

6. A worker whose duties require him or her to travel regularly in the service of his or her employer in this and one or more other states may agree in writing with his or her employer that his or her employment is principally localized in this or another state, and, unless the other state refuses jurisdiction, the agreement shall govern as to any injury occurring after the effective date of the agreement.

7. The director is authorized to enter into agreements with the appropriate agencies of other states and provinces of Canada that administer their workers' compensation law with respect to conflicts of jurisdiction and the assumption of jurisdiction in cases where the contract of employment arises in one state or province and the injury occurs in another. If the other state's or province's law requires Washington employers to secure the payment of compensation under the other state's or province's workers' compensation laws for work performed in that state or province, then employers domiciled in that state or province must purchase compensation covering their workers engaged in that work in this state under this state's industrial insurance law. When an agreement under this subsection has been executed and adopted as a rule of the department under chapter 34.05 RCW, it binds all employers and workers subject to this title and the jurisdiction of this title is governed by this rule.

8. Washington employers who are not self-insured under chapter 51.14 RCW shall obtain workers' compensation coverage from the state fund for temporary and incidental work performed on jobs or at jobsites in another state by their Washington workers. The department is authorized to adopt rules governing premium liability and reporting requirements for hours of work in excess of temporary and incidental as defined in this chapter.

9. "Temporary and incidental" means work performed by Washington employers on jobs or at jobsites in another state for thirty or fewer consecutive or nonconsecutive full or partial days within a calendar year. Temporary and incidental days are considered on a per state basis.

10. By December 1, 2011, the department shall report to the workers' compensation advisory committee on the effect of this section on the revenue and costs to the state fund.

2. The assumed wage rate for all apprentices or trainees during the hours they are participating in supplemental and related instruction classes, shall be three dollars per hour.

3. Only those apprentices or trainees who are registered with the state apprenticeship council prior to their injury or death and who incur such injury or death while participating in supplemental and related instruction classes shall be entitled to benefits under the provisions of Title 51 RCW.

4.

3. Coverage under this section shall be for all the applicable death, disability, and medical aid benefits of this title and shall be effective only for injuries which occur and occupational diseases which are contracted after the notice of coverage has been filed with the director.

4. Volunteer law enforcement officers for whom municipal corporations have given notice of coverage under this section shall be deemed workers or employees, as the case may be, and the performance of their duties shall be deemed employment or in the course of employment, as the case may be, for all purposes of this title except where expressly excluded or where the context clearly requires otherwise.
