Supp. 1947 § 7676d, part; \]

## 51.48.022 - Failure to secure payment of compensation—Stop work order—Penalty—Rules.
1. In addition to the penalties provided by this chapter, an employer performing services that require registration under chapter 18.27 RCW or licensing under chapter 19.28 RCW who violates RCW 51.14.010 may be subject to a stop work order issued under this section.

2. If the director determines after an investigation that an employer is in violation of RCW 51.14.010, the director may issue a stop work order against the employer requiring the cessation of business operations of the employer. Service of the order must be in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

3. When a stop work order is served on a worksite by posting a copy of the stop work order in a conspicuous location at the worksite, it is effective as to the employer's operations on that worksite. When a stop work order is served on the employer, the order is effective to all employer worksites for which the employer is not in compliance. Business operations of the employer must cease immediately upon service consistent with the stop work order. The order remains in effect until the director issues an order releasing the stop work order upon finding that the employer has come into compliance and has paid any premiums, penalties, and interest under this title or issues an order of conditional release pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.

4. An employer who violates a stop work order is subject to a one thousand dollar penalty for each day not in compliance.

5. An employer against whom a stop work order has been issued may request reconsideration from the department or may appeal to the board of industrial insurance appeals. The request must be made in writing to the department or the board within ten days of receiving the stop work order at the worksite or in person. If the department conducts a reconsideration, it must be concluded within ten days of receiving the request for reconsideration by the employer. The stop work order remains in effect during the period of reconsideration or appeal, unless the employer furnishes to the department a cash deposit or bond in the amount of five thousand dollars or one thousand dollars per covered worker identified, whichever is greater. At time of a final order upholding a stop work order, the bond or cash deposit will be seized and applied to the premium, penalty, and interest balance of that employer. In an appeal before the board, the appellant has the burden of proceeding with the evidence to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought in such appeal. RCW 51.52.080 through 51.52.106 govern appeals under this section. Further appeals taken from a final decision of the board under this section are governed by the provisions relating to judicial review of administrative decisions contained in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598, and the department has the same right of review from the board's decisions as do employers.

6. The director may issue an order of conditional release from the stop work order if the employer has complied with the coverage requirements of this title and agreed to pay premiums, penalties, and interest through a payment schedule. If the terms of the schedule are not met, the stop work order may be reinstated and the unpaid balance will become due. 

7. Stop work orders and penalties assessed under this chapter remain in effect against any successor corporation or business entity that has one or more of the same principals or officers as the employer against whom the stop work order was issued and which is engaged in the same or equivalent trade or activity.

8. The department may adopt rules to carry out this section.

\[ [2009 c 196 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5613-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20196%20§%201); \]

## 51.48.025 - Retaliation by employer prohibited—Investigation—Remedies.
1. No employer may discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed or communicated to the employer an intent to file a claim for compensation or exercises any rights provided under this title. However, nothing in this section prevents an employer from taking any action against a worker for other reasons including, but not limited to, the worker's failure to observe health or safety standards adopted by the employer, or the frequency or nature of the worker's job-related accidents.

2. Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by an employer in violation of this section may file a complaint with the director alleging discrimination within ninety days of the date of the alleged violation. Upon receipt of such complaint, the director shall cause an investigation to be made as the director deems appropriate. Within ninety days of the receipt of a complaint filed under this section, the director shall notify the complainant of his or her determination. If upon such investigation, it is determined that this section has been violated, the director shall bring an action in the superior court of the county in which the violation is alleged to have occurred.

3. If the director determines that this section has not been violated, the employee may institute the action on his or her own behalf.

4. In any action brought under this section, the superior court shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown, to restrain violations of subsection (1) of this section and to order all appropriate relief including rehiring or reinstatement of the employee with back pay.

\[ [1985 c 347 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c347.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20347%20§%208); \]

## 51.48.030 - Failure to keep records and make reports.
1. Every employer who fails to keep and preserve the records required by this title or fails to make the reports provided in this title shall be subject to a penalty determined by the director but not to exceed five hundred dollars or two hundred percent of the quarterly tax for each such offense, whichever is greater. Any employer who fails to keep and preserve the records adequate to determine taxes due shall be forever barred from questioning, in an appeal before the board of industrial insurance appeals or the courts, the correctness of any assessment by the department based on any period for which such records have not been kept and preserved.

2. The department may waive penalties for first-time or de minimis violations of this section. Any penalty that is waived under this section may be reinstated and imposed in addition to any additional penalties associated with a subsequent violation or failure within a year to correct the previous violation as required by the department.

Supp. 1947 § 7676d, part; \]

## 51.48.040 - Inspection of employer's records.
1. The books, records and payrolls of the employer pertinent to the administration of this title shall always be open to inspection by the department or its traveling auditor, agent or assistant, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of the payroll, the persons employed, and such other information as may be necessary for the department and its management under this title.

2. Refusal on the part of the employer to submit his or her books, records and payrolls for such inspection to the department, or any assistant presenting written authority from the director, shall subject the offending employer to a penalty determined by the director but not to exceed five hundred dollars for each offense and the individual who personally gives such refusal is guilty of a misdemeanor.

3. Any employer who fails to allow adequate inspection in accordance with the requirements of this section is subject to having its certificate of coverage revoked by order of the department and is forever barred from questioning in any proceeding in front of the board of industrial insurance appeals or any court, the correctness of any assessment by the department based on any period for which such records have not been produced for inspection.

## 51.48.131 - Notice of assessment for default in payments by employer—Appeal.
A notice of assessment becomes final thirty days from the date the notice of assessment was served upon the employer unless: (1) A written request for reconsideration is filed with the department of labor and industries, or (2) an appeal is filed with the board of industrial insurance appeals and sent to the director of labor and industries by mail or delivered in person. The appeal shall not be denied solely on the basis that it was not filed with both the board and the director if it was filed with either the board or the director. The appeal shall set forth with particularity the reason for the employer's appeal and the amounts, if any, that the employer admits are due.

The department, within thirty days after receiving a notice of appeal, may modify, reverse, or change any notice of assessment, or may hold any such notice of assessment in abeyance pending further investigation, and the board shall thereupon deny the appeal, without prejudice to the employer's right to appeal from any subsequent determinative notice of assessment issued by the department.

The burden of proof rests upon the employer in an appeal to prove that the taxes and penalties assessed upon the employer in the notice of assessment are incorrect. The department shall promptly transmit its original record, or a legible copy thereof, produced by mechanical, photographic, or electronic means, in such matter to the board. RCW 51.52.080 through 51.52.106 govern appeals under this section.

If a notice of appeal is not served on the director and the board of industrial insurance appeals pursuant to RCW 51.48.131 within thirty days from the date of service of the notice of assessment, or if a final decision and order of the board of industrial insurance appeals in favor of the department is not appealed to superior court in the manner specified in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598, or if a final decision of any court in favor of the department is not appealed within the time allowed by law, then the amount of the unappealed assessment, or such amount of the assessment as is found due by the final decision and order of the board of industrial insurance appeals or final decision of the court shall be deemed final and the director or the director's designee may file with the clerk of any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the notice of assessment. The clerk of the county wherein the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for such warrant, and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of such employer mentioned in the warrant, the amount of the taxes and penalties due thereon, and the date when such warrant was filed. The aggregate amount of such warrant as docketed shall become a lien upon the title to, and interest in all real and personal property of the employer against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The sheriff shall thereupon proceed upon the same in all respects and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgment in the superior court. Such warrant so docketed shall be sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the state in a manner provided by law in case of judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court shall be entitled to a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10), which shall be added to the amount of the warrant. A copy of such warrant shall be mailed to the employer within three days of filing with the clerk.

The effect of a notice and order to withhold and deliver shall be continuous from the date such notice and order to withhold and deliver is first made until the liability out of which such notice and order to withhold and deliver arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable because of lapse of time. The department shall release the notice and order to withhold and deliver when the liability out of which the notice and order to withhold and deliver arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time and shall notify the person against whom the notice and order to withhold and deliver was made that such notice and order to withhold and deliver has been released.

The notice and order to withhold and deliver shall be served by the sheriff of the county or by the sheriff's deputy, by a method for which receipt can be confirmed or tracked, or by any duly authorized representatives of the director. Any person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation or any agency of the state upon whom service has been made is hereby required to answer the notice within twenty days exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of in the notice and order to withhold and deliver. In the event there is in the possession of the party named and served with a notice and order to withhold and deliver, any property which may be subject to the claim of the department, such property shall be delivered forthwith to the director or the director's duly authorized representative upon service of the notice to withhold and deliver which will be held in trust by the director for application on the employer's indebtedness to the department, or for return without interest, in accordance with a final determination of a petition for review, or in the alternative such party shall furnish a good and sufficient surety bond satisfactory to the director conditioned upon final determination of liability. Should any party served and named in the notice to withhold and deliver fail to make answer to such notice and order to withhold and deliver, within the time prescribed herein, it shall be lawful for the court, after the time to answer such order has expired, to render judgment by default against the party named in the notice to withhold and deliver for the full amount claimed by the director in the notice to withhold and deliver together with costs. In the event that a notice to withhold and deliver is served upon an employer and the property found to be subject thereto is wages, then the employer shall be entitled to assert in the answer to all exemptions provided for by chapter 6.27 RCW to which the wage earner may be entitled.

There shall be exempt from distraint and sale under this section such goods and property as are exempt from execution under the laws of this state.

A notice specifying the property to be sold and the time and place of sale shall be posted in at least two public places in the county wherein the seizure has been made. The time of sale shall be not less than twenty days from the date of posting of such notices. The sale may be adjourned from time to time at the discretion of the director or the director's designee, but not for a time to exceed in all sixty days. No sale shall take place if an appeal is pending. The sale shall be conducted by the director or the director's designee who shall proceed to sell such property by parcel or by lot at a public auction, and who may set a minimum price to include the expenses of making a levy and of advertising the sale, and if the amount bid for such property at the sale is not equal to the minimum price so fixed, the director or the director's designee may declare such property to be purchased by the department for such minimum price. In such event the delinquent account shall be credited with the amount for which the property has been sold. Property acquired by the department as herein prescribed may be sold by the director or the director's designee at public or private sale, and the amount realized shall be placed in the state of Washington industrial insurance fund.

In all cases of sale, as aforesaid, the director or the director's designee shall issue a bill of sale or a deed to the purchaser and the bill of sale or deed shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the director or the director's designee to make such sale and conclusive evidence of the regularity of the proceeding in making the sale, and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the delinquent employer in said property. The proceeds of any such sale, except in those cases wherein the property has been acquired by the department, shall be first applied by the director or the director's designee in satisfaction of the delinquent account, and out of any sum received in excess of the amount of delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties the industrial insurance fund shall be reimbursed for the costs of distraint and sale. Any excess which shall thereafter remain in the hands of the director or the director's designee shall be refunded to the delinquent employer. Sums so refundable to a delinquent employer may be subject to seizure or distraint in the hands of the director or the director's designee by any other taxing authority of the state or its political subdivisions.
