## 51.14.010 - Duty to secure payment of compensation—Options.
Every employer under this title shall secure the payment of compensation under this title by:

1. Insuring and keeping insured the payment of such benefits with the state fund; or

2. Qualifying as a self-insurer under this title.

\[ [1971 ex.s. c 289 § 26](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c289.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20289%20§%2026); \]

## 51.14.020 - Qualification.
1. An employer may qualify as a self-insurer by establishing to the director's satisfaction that he or she has sufficient financial ability to make certain the prompt payment of all compensation under this title and all assessments which may become due from such employer. Each application for certification as a self-insurer submitted by an employer shall be accompanied by payment of a fee of one hundred fifty dollars or such larger sum as the director shall find necessary for the administrative costs of evaluation of the applicant's qualifications. Any employer who has formerly been certified as a self-insurer and thereafter ceases to be so certified may not apply for certification within three years of ceasing to have been so certified.

2. [Empty]

   a. A self-insurer may be required by the director to supplement existing financial ability by depositing in an escrow account in a depository designated by the director, money and/or corporate or governmental securities approved by the director, or a surety bond written by any company admitted to transact surety business in this state, or provide an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a federally or state chartered commercial banking institution authorized to conduct business in the state of Washington filed with the department. The money, securities, bond, or letter of credit shall be in an amount reasonably sufficient in the director's discretion to insure payment of reasonably foreseeable compensation and assessments but not less than the employer's normal expected annual claim liabilities and in no event less than one hundred thousand dollars. In arriving at the amount of money, securities, bond, or letter of credit required under this subsection, the director shall take into consideration the financial ability of the employer to pay compensation and assessments and his or her probable continuity of operation. However, a letter of credit shall be acceptable only if the self-insurer has a net worth of not less than five hundred million dollars as evidenced in an annual financial statement prepared by a qualified, independent auditor using generally accepted accounting principles. The money, securities, bond, or letter of credit so deposited shall be held by the director solely for the payment of compensation by the self-insurer and his or her assessments. In the event of default the self-insurer loses all right and title to, any interest in, and any right to control the surety. The amount of surety may be increased or decreased from time to time by the director. The income from any securities deposited may be distributed currently to the self-insurer.

   b. The letter of credit option authorized in (a) of this subsection shall not apply to self-insurers authorized under RCW 51.14.150 or to self-insurers who are counties, cities, or municipal corporations.

3. Securities or money deposited by an employer pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall be returned to him or her upon his or her written request provided the employer files the bond required by such subsection.

4. If the employer seeking to qualify as a self-insurer has previously insured with the state fund, the director shall require the employer to make up his or her proper share of any deficit or insufficiency in the state fund as a condition to certification as a self-insurer.

5. A self-insurer may reinsure a portion of his or her liability under this title with any reinsurer authorized to transact such reinsurance in this state: PROVIDED, That the reinsurer may not participate in the administration of the responsibilities of the self-insurer under this title. Such reinsurance may not exceed eighty percent of the liabilities under this title.

6. For purposes of the application of this section, the department may adopt separate rules establishing the security requirements applicable to units of local government. In setting such requirements, the department shall take into consideration the ability of the governmental unit to meet its self-insured obligations, such as but not limited to source of funds, permanency, and right of default.

7. The director shall adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section including, but not limited to, rules respecting the terms and conditions of letters of credit and the establishment of the appropriate level of net worth of the self-insurer to qualify for use of the letter of credit. Only letters of credit issued in strict compliance with the rules shall be deemed acceptable.

2. He or she has submitted to the department a payroll report for the preceding consecutive twelve-month period.

   f. The qualifications of the personnel of the employer to perform this service.

6. He or she has demonstrated to the department the ability and commitment to submit electronically the claims [data] required by RCW 51.14.110.

Such certification shall remain in effect until withdrawn by the director or surrendered by the employer with the approval of the director.

## 51.14.040 - Surety liability—Termination.
1. The surety on a bond filed by a self-insurer pursuant to this title may terminate its liability thereon by giving the director written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such termination shall be effective.

2. In case of such termination, the surety shall remain liable, in accordance with the terms of the bond, with respect to future compensation for injuries to employees of the self-insurer occurring prior to the termination of the surety's liability.

3. If the bond is terminated for any reason other than the employer's terminating his or her status as a self-insurer, the employer shall, prior to the date of termination of the surety's liability, otherwise comply with the requirements of this title.

4. The liability of a surety on any bond filed pursuant to this section shall be released and extinguished and the bond returned to the employer or surety provided either such liability is secured by another bond filed, or money or securities deposited as required by this title.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 14003](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%2014003); [1971 ex.s. c 289 § 29](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c289.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20289%20§%2029); \]

## 51.14.050 - Termination of status—Notice—Financial requirements.
1. Any employer may at any time terminate his or her status as a self-insurer by giving the director written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such termination shall be effective, provided such termination shall not be effective until the employer either shall have ceased to be an employer or shall have filed with the director for state industrial insurance coverage under this title.

2. An employer who ceases to be a self-insurer, and who so files with the director, must maintain money, securities, or surety bonds deemed sufficient in the director's discretion to cover the entire liability of such employer for injuries or occupational diseases to his or her employees which occurred during the period of self-insurance: PROVIDED, That the director may agree for the medical aid and accident funds to assume the obligation of such claims, in whole or in part, and shall adjust the employer's premium rate to provide for the payment of such obligations on behalf of the employer.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 14004](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%2014004); [1971 ex.s. c 289 § 30](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c289.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20289%20§%2030); \]

## 51.14.060 - Default by self-insurer—Authority of director—Liability for reimbursement.
1. The director may, in cases of default upon any obligation under this title by the self-insurer, after ten days notice by certified mail to the defaulting self-insurer of the intention to do so, bring suit upon such bond or collect the interest and principal of any of the securities as they may become due or sell the securities or any of them as may be required or apply the money deposited, all in order to pay compensation and discharge the obligations of the defaulting self-insurer under this title.

2. The director shall be authorized to fulfill the defaulting self-insured employer's obligations under this title from the defaulting self-insured employer's deposit or from other funds provided under this title for the satisfaction of claims against the defaulting self-insured employer.

\[ [2010 c 213 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/3061.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20213%20§%202); [1986 c 57 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c57.pdf?cite=1986%20c%2057%20§%202); [1971 ex.s. c 289 § 31](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c289.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20289%20§%2031); \]

## 51.14.070 - Payments upon default.
Whenever compensation due under this title is not paid because of an uncorrected default of a self-insurer, such compensation shall be paid from the medical aid and accidents funds, and any moneys obtained by the director from the bonds or other security provided under RCW 51.14.020 shall be deposited to the appropriate fund for the payment of compensation and administrative costs, including attorneys' fees.

\[ [1986 c 57 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c57.pdf?cite=1986%20c%2057%20§%203); [1971 ex.s. c 289 § 36](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c289.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20289%20§%2036); \]

## 51.14.073 - Default lien.
1. In all cases of probate, insolvency, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or bankruptcy, the claim of the state for the amounts necessary to fulfill the obligations of a defaulting self-insured employer together with administrative costs and attorneys' fees is a lien prior to all other liens or claims and on a parity with prior tax liens and the mere existence of a default by a self-insured employer is sufficient to create the lien without any prior or subsequent action by the state. All administrators, receivers, and assignees for the benefit of creditors shall notify the director of such administration, receivership, or assignment within thirty days of their appointment or qualification.

2. Separate and apart and in addition to the lien established by this section, the department may issue an assessment, as provided for in RCW 51.48.120, for the amount necessary to fulfill the defaulting self-insured employer's obligations, including all amounts paid and payable as compensation under this title and administrative costs, including attorneys' fees.

\[ [1986 c 57 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c57.pdf?cite=1986%20c%2057%20§%204); \]

The self-insurers' insolvency trust shall be funded by an insolvency assessment which shall be levied on a post-insolvency basis and after the defaulting self-insured employer's security deposit, assets, and reinsurance, if any, have been exhausted. Insolvency assessments shall be imposed on all self-insured employers, except school districts, cities, and counties. The manner of imposing and collecting assessments to the insolvency fund shall be set forth in rules adopted by the department to ensure that self-insured employers pay into the fund in proportion to their claim costs. The department's rules shall provide that self-insured employers who have surrendered their certification shall be assessed for a period of not more than three calendar years following the termination date of their certification.

2. The director shall adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section, including but not limited to:

2. The self-insurer's deposit is insufficient; or

3. The self-insurer intentionally or repeatedly induces employees to fail to report injuries, induces claimants to treat injuries in the course of employment as off-the-job injuries, persuades claimants to accept less than the compensation due, or unreasonably makes it necessary for claimants to resort to proceedings against the employer to obtain compensation; or

4. The self-insurer habitually fails to comply with rules and regulations of the director regarding reports or other requirements necessary to carry out the purposes of this title; or

5. The self-insurer habitually engages in a practice of arbitrarily or unreasonably refusing employment to applicants for employment or discharging employees because of nondisabling bodily conditions; or

6. The self-insurer fails to pay an insolvency assessment under the procedures established pursuant to RCW 51.14.077.

\[ [1986 c 57 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c57.pdf?cite=1986%20c%2057%20§%207); [1971 ex.s. c 289 § 32](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c289.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20289%20§%2032); \]

## 51.14.090 - Withdrawal of certification, corrective action upon employees' petition.
1. Upon the petition of any employee or union or association having a substantial number of employees in the employ of the self-insurer the director or the director's designee may, in the director or designee's sole discretion, hold a hearing to determine whether or not there are grounds for the withdrawal of certification of a self-insurer or for corrective action by the department.

2. The director shall serve upon the self-insurer and upon any employee or union or association having a substantial number of employees in the employ of said self-insurer, personally or by certified mail, a notice of intention to withdraw, or not to withdraw, certification of the self-insurer, which notice shall describe the nature and location or locations of the plants or operations involved; and the specific nature of the reasons for the decision.

Proceedings on the appeal shall be as prescribed in this title. Appeal by a self-insurer of notice of intention to withdraw certification or to take corrective action shall not act as a stay of the withdrawal or corrective action, unless the board or court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise.

5. The director may adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section.

\[ [1996 c 58 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6222.SL.pdf?cite=1996%20c%2058%20§%201); [1983 c 21 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c21.pdf?cite=1983%20c%2021%20§%201); [1971 ex.s. c 289 § 33](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c289.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20289%20§%2033); \]
