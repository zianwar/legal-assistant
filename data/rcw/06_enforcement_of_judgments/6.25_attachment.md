No final judgment shall be rendered in such action until the debt or demand upon which it is based becomes due, unless the defendant consents by filing pleadings or otherwise. However, property of a perishable nature may be sold as provided in RCW 6.25.220.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 805](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20805); [1886 p 40 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1886%20p%2040%20§%204); RRS § 650; Code 1881 §§ 174-192; 1877 pp 35-40; 1873 pp 43-50; 1871 pp 9, 10; 1869 pp 41-47; 1863 pp 112-120; 1860 pp 30-36; 1854 pp 155-162; \]

1.

2. Subject to subsection (3) of this section, the court shall issue the writ without prior notice to defendant and an opportunity for a prior hearing only if:

   a. [Empty]

      i.

You may also have a right to have your property released if it is exempt property as described in the copies of statutes included with this notice and if you claim your exemptions in the way described in the statutes.

5. If service of notice on the defendant must be effected by publication, only the following notice need be published under the caption of the case:

To Defendant:

A writ of attachment has been issued in the above-captioned case, directed to the Sheriff of . . . . . . County, commanding the Sheriff as follows:

"WHEREAS, . . . [Quoting body of writ of attachment]"

You have a right to ask for a hearing.

If the defendant is an individual, the following paragraph shall be added to the published notice:

You may also have a right to have your property released if it is exempt property as described in Washington exemption statutes, including sections 6.13.010, 6.13.030, 6.13.040, 6.15.010, and 6.15.060 of the Revised Code of Washington, in the manner described in those statutes.

## 6.25.080 - Issuance of writ—Attachment bond.
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, before the writ of attachment shall issue, the plaintiff, or someone in the plaintiff's behalf, shall execute and file with the clerk a surety bond or undertaking in the sum in no case less than three thousand dollars, in the superior court, nor less than five hundred dollars in the district court, and double the amount for which plaintiff demands judgment, or such other amount as the court shall fix, conditional that the plaintiff will prosecute the action without delay and will pay all costs that may be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages that the defendant may sustain by reason of the writ of attachment or of additional writs issued as permitted under RCW 6.25.120, not exceeding the amount specified in such bond or undertaking, as the penalty thereof, should the same be wrongfully, oppressively or maliciously sued out.

2.

3. If the plaintiff sues on an assigned claim and the plaintiff's immediate or any other assignor thereof retains or has any interest in the claim, then the plaintiff and every assignor who retains or has any interest therein shall be jointly and severally liable for all costs that may be adjudged to the defendant and for all damages that the defendant may sustain by reason of the attachment, should the same be wrongfully, oppressively or maliciously sued out.

## 6.25.100 - Action on bond—Damages and attorney's fees.
In an action on such bond, if it is shown that the attachment was wrongfully sued out, the defendant may recover the actual damages sustained and reasonable attorney's fees to be fixed by the court. If it is shown that such attachment was sued out maliciously, the defendant may recover exemplary damages, and the defendant need not wait until the principal suit is determined before suing on the bond.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 810](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20810); [1886 p 41 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1886%20p%2041%20§%208); RRS § 654; Code 1881 §§ 174-192; 1877 pp 35-40; 1873 pp 43-50; 1871 pp 9, 10; 1869 pp 41-47; 1863 pp 112-120; 1860 pp 30-36; 1854 pp 155-162; \]

## 6.25.110 - Contents of writ—Levy of attachment.
The writ of attachment shall be directed to the sheriff of any county in which property of the defendant may be, and shall require the sheriff to attach and safely keep the property of such defendant within the county, to the requisite amount, which shall be stated in conformity with the affidavit. The sheriff shall in all cases attach the amount of property directed, if sufficient property not exempted from execution be found in the county, giving that in which the defendant has a legal and unquestionable title a preference over that in which title is doubtful or only equitable, and the sheriff shall as nearly as the circumstances of the case will permit, levy upon property fifty percent greater in valuation than the amount that the plaintiff in the affidavit claims to be due. When property is seized on attachment, the court may allow to the officer having charge thereof such compensation for the trouble and expenses in keeping the same as shall be reasonable and just.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 811](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20811); [1886 p 41 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1886%20p%2041%20§%209); RRS § 655; Code 1881 §§ 174-192; 1877 pp 35-40; 1873 pp 43-50; 1871 pp 9, 10; 1869 pp 41-47; 1863 pp 112-120; 1860 pp 30-36; 1854 pp 155-162; \]

## 6.25.120 - Writs to different counties—Successive writs.
If issuance of a writ of attachment has been ordered by the court in a case, other writs of attachment may be issued in the same case from the court to different counties, and several may, at the option of the plaintiff, be issued at the same time, or in succession and subsequently, until sufficient property has been attached; but only those executed shall be taxed in the costs, unless otherwise ordered by the court, and if more property is attached in the aggregate than the plaintiff is entitled to have held, the surplus must be abandoned and the plaintiff pay all costs incurred in relation to such surplus. After the first writ has issued, it shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to file any further affidavit or bond unless the court otherwise directs, but the plaintiff shall be entitled to as many writs as may be necessary to secure the amount claimed.

\[ [1988 c 231 § 17](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c231.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20231%20§%2017); [1987 c 442 § 812](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20812); [1886 p 41 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1886%20p%2041%20§%2010); RRS § 656; Code 1881 §§ 174-192; 1877 pp 35-40; 1873 pp 43-50; 1871 pp 9, 10; 1869 pp 41-47; 1863 pp 112-120; 1860 pp 30-36; 1854 pp 155-162; \]

\[ [1987 c 442 § 813](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20813); [1886 p 41 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1886%20p%2041%20§%2011); RRS § 657; Code 1881 §§ 174-192; 1877 pp 35-40; 1873 pp 43-50; 1871 pp 9, 10; 1869 pp 41-47; 1863 pp 112-120; 1860 pp 30-36; 1854 pp 155-162; \]
