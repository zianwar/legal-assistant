## 6.17.020 - Execution authorized within 10 years—Exceptions—Fee—Recoverable cost. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. Except as provided in subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the party in whose favor a judgment of a court has been or may be filed or rendered, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may have an execution, garnishment, or other legal process issued for the collection or enforcement of the judgment at any time within ten years from entry of the judgment or the filing of the judgment in this state.

2. After July 23, 1989, a party who obtains a judgment or order of a court or an administrative order entered as defined in RCW 74.20A.020(6) for accrued child support, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may have an execution, garnishment, or other legal process issued upon that judgment or order at any time within ten years of the eighteenth birthday of the youngest child named in the order for whom support is ordered.

3. After June 9, 1994, a party in whose favor a judgment has been filed as a foreign judgment or rendered pursuant to subsection (1) or (4) of this section, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may, within ninety days before the expiration of the original ten-year period, apply to the court that rendered the judgment or to the court where the judgment was filed as a foreign judgment for an order granting an additional ten years during which an execution, garnishment, or other legal process may be issued. If a district court judgment of this state is transcribed to a superior court of this state, the original district court judgment shall not be extended and any petition under this section to extend the judgment that has been transcribed to superior court shall be filed in the superior court within ninety days before the expiration of the ten-year period of the date the transcript of the district court judgment was filed in the superior court of this state. The petitioner shall pay to the court a filing fee equal to the filing fee for filing the first or initial paper in a civil action in the court, except in the case of district court judgments transcribed to superior court, where the filing fee shall be the fee for filing the first or initial paper in a civil action in the superior court where the judgment was transcribed. The order granting the application shall contain an updated judgment summary as provided in RCW 4.64.030. The filing fee required under this subsection shall be included in the judgment summary and shall be a recoverable cost. The application shall be granted as a matter of right, subject to review only for timeliness, factual issues of full or partial satisfaction, or errors in calculating the judgment summary amounts.

4. A party who obtains a judgment or order for restitution, crime victims' assessment, or other court-ordered legal financial obligations pursuant to a criminal judgment and sentence, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may execute, garnish, and/or have legal process issued upon the judgment or order any time within ten years subsequent to the entry of the judgment and sentence or ten years following the offender's release from total confinement as provided in chapter 9.94A RCW. The clerk of superior court, or a party designated by the clerk, may seek extension under subsection (3) of this section for purposes of collection as allowed under RCW 36.18.190, provided that no filing fee shall be required.

5. "Court" as used in this section includes but is not limited to the United States supreme court, the United States courts of appeals, the United States district courts, the United States bankruptcy courts, the Washington state supreme court, the court of appeals of the state of Washington, superior courts and district courts of the counties of the state of Washington, and courts of other states and jurisdictions from which judgment has been filed in this state under chapter 6.36 or * 6.40 RCW.

6. The perfection of any judgment lien and the priority of that judgment lien on property as established by RCW 6.13.090 and chapter 4.56 RCW is not altered by the extension of the judgment pursuant to the provisions of this section and the lien remains in full force and effect and does not have to be rerecorded after it is extended. Continued perfection of a judgment that has been transcribed to other counties and perfected in those counties may be accomplished after extension of the judgment by filing with the clerk of the other counties where the judgment has been filed either a certified copy of the order extending the judgment or a certified copy of the docket of the matter where the judgment was extended.

7. Except as ordered in RCW 4.16.020 (2) or (3), chapter 9.94A RCW, or chapter 13.40 RCW, no judgment is enforceable for a period exceeding twenty years from the date of entry in the originating court. Nothing in this section may be interpreted to extend the expiration date of a foreign judgment beyond the expiration date under the laws of the jurisdiction where the judgment originated.

8. The chapter 261, Laws of 2002 amendments to this section apply to all judgments currently in effect on June 13, 2002, to all judgments extended after June 9, 1994, unless the judgment has been satisfied, vacated, and/or quashed, and to all judgments filed or rendered, or both, after June 13, 2002.

## 6.17.030 - Execution in name of assignee or personal representative.
When a judgment recovered in any court of this state has been assigned, execution may issue in the name of the assignee after the assignment has been recorded in the execution docket by the clerk of the court in which the judgment was recovered. When the person in whose name execution might have issued has died, execution may issue in the name of the executor, administrator or legal representative of such deceased person after letters testamentary or of administration or other sufficient proof has been filed in the cause and recorded in the execution docket by the clerk of the court in which the judgment was entered.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 403](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20403); [1957 c 8 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1957c8.pdf?cite=1957%20c%208%20§%202); [1929 c 25 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1929c25.pdf?cite=1929%20c%2025%20§%207); RRS § 519; Code 1881 § 334; [1877 p 70 § 338](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2070%20§%20338); [1869 p 84 § 330](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%2084%20§%20330); \]

## 6.17.040 - Stay of execution—Bond—Time periods.
In addition to any stay of execution provided by court rule, stay of execution shall be allowed on judgments of the courts of this state for the following periods upon the judgment debtor filing with the clerk of the court in which the judgment was entered a bond in double the amount of the judgment and costs, with surety to the satisfaction of the clerk, conditioned to pay the judgment, interests, costs, and increased costs, at the expiration of the stay period. If execution is issued before elapse of the stay period, the judgment debtor may nevertheless stay execution for the balance of the period by filing the required bond.

## 6.17.050 - Stay of execution—Judgment against surety on bond if not paid.
If execution of a judgment is stayed as permitted by RCW 6.17.040 and the judgment is not satisfied at expiration of the stay period, at any time thereafter the judgment creditor may, upon motion supported by an affidavit that the judgment or any part of it is unpaid and stating how much still remains due, have judgment against the surety on the bond for the balance remaining due, and have an execution on the judgment against the surety, on which stay shall not be allowed.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 405](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20405); \]

## 6.17.060 - Kinds of execution.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 406](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20406); [1929 c 25 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1929c25.pdf?cite=1929%20c%2025%20§%203); RRS § 511; Code 1881 § 327; [1877 p 68 § 331](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2068%20§%20331); [1854 p 176 § 244](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1854%20p%20176%20§%20244); \]

## 6.17.070 - Execution in particular cases.
When any judgment of a court of this state requires the payment of money or the delivery of real or personal property, it may be enforced by execution. When a judgment of a court of record requires the performance of any other act, a certified copy of the judgment may be served on the party against whom it is given or the person or officer who is required by the judgment or by law to obey the same, and a writ may be issued commanding the person or officer to obey or enforce the judgment. Refusal to do so may be punished by the court as for contempt.

## 6.17.080 - Enforcement of judgment against local governmental entity.
No execution may issue for collection of a judgment for the recovery of money or damages against a local governmental entity. Any such judgment may be enforced as follows:

1. The judgment creditor may at any time when execution might issue on a like judgment against a private person, and after acknowledging satisfaction of the judgment as in ordinary cases, obtain from the clerk a certified transcript of the judgment. The clerk shall include in the transcript a copy of the memorandum of acknowledgment of satisfaction and the entry thereof as the basis for an order on the treasurer for payment. Unless the transcript contains such memorandum, no order upon the treasurer shall issue thereon.

2. The judgment creditor shall present the certified transcript showing satisfaction of the judgment to the officer of the local governmental entity who is authorized to draw orders on its treasury.

3. The officer shall draw an order on the treasurer for the amount of the judgment, in favor of the judgment creditor. The order shall be presented for payment and paid with like effect and in like manner as other orders upon the treasurer. If the proper officer of the local governmental entity fails or refuses to draw the order for payment of the judgment as provided in this section, a writ of mandamus may be issued in the original case to compel performance of the duty.

4. As used in this section, the term "local governmental entity" means a county, city, town, special district, municipal corporation, or quasi-municipal corporation.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 409](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20409); [1929 c 25 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1929c25.pdf?cite=1929%20c%2025%20§%206); RRS § 518; Code 1881 § 333; [1877 p 70 § 337](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2070%20§%20337); [1854 p 177 § 251](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1854%20p%20177%20§%20251); \]

## 6.17.100 - Affidavit of judgment creditor—Filing required before issuance of writ—Contents.
1. Before a writ of execution may issue on any real property, the judgment creditor must file with the court an affidavit as described in subsection (4) of this section and must mail a copy of the affidavit to the judgment debtor at the debtor's last known address.

2. If the affidavit attests that the premises are occupied or otherwise claimed as a homestead by the judgment debtor, the execution for the enforcement of a judgment obtained in a case not within the classes enumerated in RCW 6.13.080 must comply with RCW 6.13.100 through 6.13.170.

3. The term "due diligence," as used in subsection (4) of this section, includes but is not limited to the creditor or the creditor's representative personally visiting the premises, contacting the occupants and inquiring about their relationship to the judgment debtor, contacting immediate neighbors of the premises, and searching the records of the auditor of the county in which the property is located to determine if a declaration of homestead or nonabandonment has been recorded by the judgment debtor. An examination of the debtor in supplemental proceedings on the points to be covered in the affidavit constitutes "due diligence."

4. The affidavit required by this section shall include:

   a. A statement that the judgment creditor has exercised due diligence to ascertain whether the judgment debtor has sufficient nonexempt personal property to satisfy the judgment with interest and believes that there is not sufficient nonexempt personal property belonging to the judgment debtor to so satisfy the judgment. A list of personal property located shall be attached with an indication of any items that the judgment creditor believes to be exempt.

   b. A statement that the judgment creditor has exercised due diligence to ascertain whether the property is occupied or otherwise claimed by the judgment debtor as a homestead as defined in chapter 6.13 RCW.

   c. A statement based on belief whether the judgment debtor is currently occupying the property as the judgment debtor's principal residence and whether there is a declaration of homestead or nonabandonment of record. If the affidavit alleges that the property is not occupied or claimed as a homestead, the creditor must list the facts relied upon to reach that conclusion.

   d. If the judgment debtor is not occupying the property and there is no declaration of nonabandonment of record, a statement based on belief whether the judgment debtor has been absent for a period of at least six months, with facts relied upon to reach that conclusion, and, if known, the judgment debtor's current address.

1. The writ of execution shall be issued in the name of the state of Washington, sealed with the seal of the court, and subscribed by the clerk of the court in which the judgment was entered or to which it has been transferred, and shall be directed to the sheriff of the county in which the property is situated. The writ shall intelligibly refer to the judgment, stating the court, the county where the judgment was rendered, the names of the parties, the amount of the judgment if it be for money, and the amount actually due thereon; and if the judgment has been recorded, the writ shall so indicate and shall state the recording number.

2. Before an execution is delivered on a judgment of a district court of this state, the amount of the judgment, or damages and costs, and the fees due to each person separately shall be entered in the docket and on the back of the execution. In any proceeding to enforce a judgment certified to a district court from the small claims department under *RCW 12.40.110, the execution shall include the amount of the judgment owed plus reasonable costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the judgment creditor in seeking enforcement of the judgment in district court.

3. A writ shall require substantially as follows:

   a. If the execution is against the property of the judgment debtor, it shall require the officer to satisfy the judgment out of the personal property of the debtor unless an affidavit has been filed with the court pursuant to RCW 6.17.100, in which case it shall require that the judgment be satisfied out of the real property of the debtor.

   b. If the execution is against real or personal property in the hands of a personal representative, heir, devisee, legatee, tenant of real property, or trustee, it shall require the officer to satisfy the judgment out of such property.

   c. If the execution is for the delivery of real or personal property, it shall particularly describe the property and state its value and require the officer to deliver possession of it to the party entitled thereto, and may, at the same time, require the officer to satisfy any charges, damages, or rents and profits recovered by the same judgment, out of the personal property of the party against whom it was rendered. If the property described in the execution cannot be delivered, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found to satisfy the judgment, it shall be satisfied out of the real property of the party against whom the judgment was rendered.

   d. If the execution is to enforce obedience to any order, it shall particularly command what is required to be done or to be omitted.

   e. If the nature of the case requires it, the execution may embrace two or more of the requirements of this section.

   f. In all cases the execution shall require the collection of all interest, costs, and increased costs thereon.
