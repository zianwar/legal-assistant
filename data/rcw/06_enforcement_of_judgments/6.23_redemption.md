## 6.23.040 - Time for redemption from redemptioner—Successive redemptions—Amount to be paid.
1. If property is redeemed from the purchaser by a redemptioner, as provided in RCW 6.23.020, another redemptioner may, within sixty days after the first redemption, redeem it from the first redemptioner. The property may be again, and as often as a redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner within sixty days after the last redemption, and such sixty-day redemption periods may extend beyond the period prescribed in RCW 6.23.020 for redemption from the purchaser.

2. The judgment debtor may also redeem from a redemptioner, but in all cases the judgment debtor shall have the entire redemption period prescribed by RCW 6.23.020, but no longer unless the time is extended under RCW 6.23.030 or 6.23.090. If the judgment debtor redeems, the effect of the sale is terminated and the estate of the debtor is restored.

3. A redemptioner may redeem under this section by paying the sum paid on the last previous redemption with interest at the rate of eight percent per annum, and the amount of any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid on the property after redeeming, with like interest, and the amount of any liens by judgment, decree, deed of trust, or mortgage, other than the judgment under which the property was sold, held by the last redemptioner, prior to his or her own, with interest. A judgment debtor who redeems from a redemptioner under this section must make the same payments as are required to effect a redemption by a redemptioner, including any lien by judgment, decree, deed of trust, or mortgage, other than the judgment under which the property was sold, held by the redemptioner. A redemptioner who pays any taxes or assessments, or has or acquires any such lien as herein mentioned, must file a statement as required under RCW 6.23.050.

\[ [2011 c 336 § 145](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5045.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20336%20§%20145); [1987 c 442 § 704](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20704); [1899 c 53 § 9](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1899c53.pdf?cite=1899%20c%2053%20§%209); RRS § 596; \]

## 6.23.050 - Purchaser or redemptioner to file statements of amounts paid.
A purchaser or redemptioner who pays any taxes or assessments or has or acquires a lien on the property by judgment, decree, deed of trust, or mortgage prior to that of a prospective redemptioner must file a statement thereof, for recording, with the recording officer of the county in which the property is situated before the property has been redeemed from him or her. Otherwise, the property may be redeemed without paying such tax, assessment, or lien, but if actual notice of such payments or liens has been given to the person who redeems, failure to file the statement shall not affect the right to payment from that person absent that person's demonstration of prejudice resulting from the failure to file the statement.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 705](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20705); \]

## 6.23.060 - Sheriff's deed—When issued.
If no redemption is made within the redemption period prescribed by RCW 6.23.020 or within any extension of that period under any other provision of this chapter, the purchaser is entitled to a sheriff's deed; or, if so redeemed, whenever sixty days have elapsed and no other redemption has been made or notice given operating to extend the period for re-redemption, and the time for redemption by the judgment debtor has expired, the last redemptioner is entitled to receive a sheriff's deed as provided in RCW 6.21.120.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 706](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20706); [1961 c 196 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c196.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20196%20§%202); [1899 c 53 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1899c53.pdf?cite=1899%20c%2053%20§%2010); RRS § 597; [1897 c 50 § 16](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1897c50.pdf?cite=1897%20c%2050%20§%2016); \]

## 6.23.070 - Payment on successive redemptions.
When two or more persons apply to the sheriff to redeem at the same time, the sheriff shall allow the person having the prior lien to redeem first, and so on. The sheriff shall immediately pay the money over to the person from whom the property is redeemed, if that person is present at time of redemption; or if not, at any time thereafter when demanded. When a sheriff wrongfully refuses to allow any person to redeem, the right to redeem shall not be prejudiced by such refusal, and the sheriff may be required, by order of the court, to allow such redemption.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 707](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20707); [1899 c 53 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1899c53.pdf?cite=1899%20c%2053%20§%2011); RRS § 598; \]

## 6.23.080 - Redemption procedure—Certificate to be recorded—Evidence of right to redeem.
1. The person seeking to redeem shall give the sheriff at least five days' written notice of intention to apply to the sheriff for that purpose. It shall be the duty of the sheriff to notify the purchaser or redemptioner, as the case may be, or the purchaser's or redemptioner's attorney, of the receipt of such notice, if such person is within such county. At the time specified in such notice, the person seeking to redeem may do so by paying to the sheriff the sum required. The sheriff shall give the person redeeming a certificate stating the sum paid on redemption, from whom redeemed, the date thereof and a description of the property redeemed. A certificate of redemption must be filed and recorded in the office of the recording officer of the county in which the property is situated, and the recording officer must note the record thereof in the margin of the record of the certificate of sale.

2. A person seeking to redeem shall submit to the sheriff the evidence of the right to redeem, as follows:

   a. A lien creditor shall submit a copy of the docket of the judgment or decree under which the right to redeem is claimed, certified by the clerk of the court where such judgment or decree is docketed; or the holder of a mortgage or deed of trust shall submit the certificate of the record thereof together with an affidavit, verified by the holder or agent, showing the amount then actually due thereon.

   b. An assignee shall submit a copy of any assignment necessary to establish the claim, verified by the affidavit of the assignee or agent, showing the amount then actually due on the judgment, decree, deed of trust, or mortgage.

3. If the redemptioner or purchaser has a lien prior to that of the lien creditor seeking to redeem, such redemptioner or purchaser shall submit to the sheriff the same kind of evidence thereof as is required from a person seeking to redeem under subsection (2) of this section, and the amount due thereon, or the same may be disregarded.

4. A purchaser who has paid a sum on a prior lien or obligation secured by an interest in the property shall submit to the sheriff an affidavit, verified by the purchaser or an agent, showing the amount paid on the prior lien or obligation, or the prior lien or obligation may be disregarded.

\[ [1987 c 442 § 708](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c442.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20442%20§%20708); [1984 c 276 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c276.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20276%20§%206); [1899 c 53 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1899c53.pdf?cite=1899%20c%2053%20§%2012); RRS § 599; \]

## 6.23.090 - Rents and profits during period of redemption—Accounting—Option for reimbursement or extension on agricultural property.
1. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section and in RCW 6.23.110, the purchaser, from the time of the sale until the redemption, and the redemptioner from the time of the redemption until another redemption, is entitled to receive from the tenant in possession the rents of the property sold or the value of the use and occupation thereof. But when any rents or profits have been received from the property by such purchaser or redemptioner, preceding the redemption thereof from him or her, the amount of such rents and profits, over and above the expenses paid for operating, caring for, protecting and insuring the property, shall be a credit upon the redemption money to be paid.

2. If a redemptioner or other person entitled to redeem, before the expiration of the time allowed for such redemption, files with the sheriff a demand in writing for a written and verified statement of the amounts of rents and profits thus received and expenses paid and incurred, the period for redemption is extended five days after such a sworn statement is given by the person receiving such rents and profits, or by his or her agent, to the person making the demand, or to the sheriff. It shall be the duty of the sheriff to serve a copy of such demand upon the person receiving such rents and profits, his or her agent or his or her attorney, if service can be made in the county where the property is situate. If such person shall, for a period of ten days after such demand has been given to the sheriff, fail or refuse to give such statement, the redemptioner or other person entitled to redeem who made the demand may bring an action within sixty days after making such demand, but not later, in any court of competent jurisdiction, to compel an accounting and disclosure of such rents, profits and expenses, and until fifteen days from and after the final determination of such action the right of redemption is extended to such redemptioner or other person entitled to redeem who made the demand. If a sworn statement is given by the purchaser or other person receiving such rents and profits, and the redemptioner or other person entitled to redeem who made the demand, desires to contest the correctness of the statement, he or she must first redeem in accordance with such sworn statement, and if he or she desires to bring an action for an accounting thereafter he or she may do so within thirty days after such redemption, but not later.

If such property is farming or agricultural property and is in possession of any purchaser or any previous redemptioner and is redeemed after the first day of April and before the first day of December, and the purchaser or previous redemptioner or the tenant of either has performed any work in preparing such property for crops or has planted crops, such purchaser or previous redemptioner shall have the option to demand reimbursement for such work and labor or to retain possession of such property until the first day of December following, and the new redemptioner shall be entitled to collect the reasonable rental value thereof during such farming year, unless such reasonable rental shall have been collected by such purchaser or previous redemptioner and accounted for to the new redemptioner.
