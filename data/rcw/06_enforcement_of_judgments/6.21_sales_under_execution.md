A vendor's interest under a real estate contract, including vendor's legal title to the real property, shall be treated as personal property for purposes of sale, but the sheriff shall give the purchaser both a bill of sale covering the vendor's interest under the contract and a sheriff's deed covering the vendor's legal title to the real property. In all other sales of personal property, the sheriff shall give the purchaser a bill of sale with an acknowledgment of payment. The sheriff shall return the proceeds with the execution to the clerk who issued the writ for payment as required by law.

## 6.21.090 - Manner of selling real estate—Sale by lot, acre—Measurement.
1. [Empty]

   a. The form and manner of selling real estate by execution shall be as follows: The sheriff shall proclaim aloud at the place of sale, in the hearing of all the bystanders: "I am about to sell the following tracts of real estate (here reading the description,) upon the following execution:" (here reading the execution). The sheriff shall also state the amount that is required upon the execution, which shall include damages, interests and costs up to the day of sale, and increased costs. The sheriff shall then offer the land for sale.

   b. If the sale is by electronic media, a copy of the execution shall be posted on the website hosting the auction sale. The website shall also include a statement from the sheriff that states the amount that is required upon the execution, which shall include damages, interests and costs up to the day of sale, and increased costs. The sheriff shall then offer the land for sale.

2. If the sale is of real property consisting of several known lots or parcels, they shall be sold separately or otherwise as the sheriff deems likely to bring the highest price, except that if an interest in a portion of such real property is claimed by a third person who, by request directed to the sheriff in writing prior to the sale or orally or in writing at the sale before the bidding is begun, requests that it be sold separately, such portion shall be sold separately. Bids on all land except town lots may be by the acre or by tract or parcel.

3. If the land is sold by the acre and any fewer number of acres than the whole tract or parcel is sold, it shall be measured off to the purchaser in a square form, from the northeast corner of the tract or parcel, unless some person claiming an interest in the land, by request directed to the sheriff in writing prior to the sale or orally or in writing at the sale before the bidding is begun, requests that the land sold be taken from some other part or in some other form; in such case, if the request is reasonable, the officer making the sale shall sell accordingly.

4. If an entire tract or parcel of land is sold by the acre, it shall not be measured but shall be deemed and taken to contain the number of acres named in the description, and be paid for accordingly; and if the number of acres is not contained in the description, the officer shall declare according to his or her judgment how many acres are contained therein, which shall be deemed and taken to be the true number of acres.

## 6.21.100 - Sale of real property to highest bidder—Sheriff's return and certificate of sale.
1. [Empty]

   a. The officer shall strike off the land to the highest bidder, who shall forthwith pay the money bid to the officer or to their agent conducting the sale by electronic media. The sheriff or their agent conducting the sale by electronic media shall tender the money to the clerk of the court that issued the writ.

   b. When final judgment shall have been entered in the supreme court or the court of appeals and the execution upon which sale has been made issued from said court, the return shall be made to the superior court in which the action was originally commenced, and the same proceedings shall be had as though execution had issued from that superior court.

2.

## 6.21.110 - Confirmation of sale—Objections—Resale—Distribution of sale proceeds—Filing of certificate.
1. Upon the return of any sale of real estate, the clerk: (a) Shall enter the cause, on which the execution or order of sale issued, by its title, on the motion docket, and mark opposite the same: "Sale of land for confirmation"; (b) shall mail notice of the filing of the return of sale to all parties who have entered a written notice of appearance in the action and who have not had an order of default entered against them; (c) shall file proof of such mailing in the action; (d) shall apply the proceeds of the sale returned by the sheriff, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to satisfaction of the judgment, including interest as provided in the judgment, and shall pay any excess proceeds as provided in subsection (5) of this section by direction of court order; and (e) upon confirmation of the sale, shall deliver the original certificate of sale to the purchaser.

2. The judgment creditor or successful purchaser at the sheriff's sale is entitled to an order confirming the sale at any time after twenty days have elapsed from the mailing of the notice of the filing of the sheriff's return, on motion with notice given to all parties who have entered a written notice of appearance in the action and who have not had an order of default entered against them, unless the judgment debtor, or in case of the judgment debtor's death, the representative, or any nondefaulting party to whom notice was sent shall file objections to confirmation with the clerk within twenty days after the mailing of the notice of the filing of such return.

3. If objections to confirmation are filed, the court shall nevertheless allow the order confirming the sale, unless on the hearing of the motion, it shall satisfactorily appear that there were substantial irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale, to the probable loss or injury of the party objecting. In the latter case, the court shall disallow the motion and direct that the property be resold, in whole or in part, as the case may be, as upon an execution received as of that date.

4. Upon a resale, the bid of the purchaser at the former sale shall be deemed to be renewed and continue in force, and no bid shall be taken, except for a greater amount. If on resale the property sells for a greater amount to any person other than the former purchaser, the clerk shall first repay to the former purchaser out of the proceeds of the resale the amount of the former purchaser's bid together with interest as is provided in the judgment.

5. [Empty]

   a. If, after confirmation of the sale and the judgment is satisfied, there are any proceeds of the sale remaining, the clerk shall pay such proceeds, as provided for in (b) of this subsection, to all interests in, or liens against, the property eliminated by sale under this section in the order of priority that the interest, lien, or claim attached to the property, as determined by the court. Any remaining proceeds shall be paid to the judgment debtor, or the judgment debtor's representative, as the case may be, before the order is made upon the motion to confirm the sale only if the party files with the clerk a waiver of all objections made or to be made to the proceedings concerning the sale; otherwise, the excess proceeds shall remain in the custody of the clerk until the sale of the property has been disposed of.

   b. Anyone seeking disbursement of surplus funds shall file a motion requesting disbursement in the superior court for the county in which the surplus funds are deposited. Notice of the motion shall be served upon or mailed to all persons who had an interest in the property at the time of sale, and any other party who has entered an appearance in the proceeding, not less than twenty days prior to the hearing of the motion. The clerk shall not disburse such remaining proceeds except upon order of the superior court of such county.

6. The purchaser shall file the original certificate of sale for record with the recording officer in the county in which the property is located.

## 6.21.120 - Sheriff's deed to real property sold.
In all cases where real estate has been, or may hereafter be sold by virtue of an execution or other process, it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer making such sale to execute and deliver to the purchaser, or other person entitled to the same, a deed of conveyance of the real estate so sold. The deeds shall be issued upon request immediately after the confirmation of sale by the court in those instances where redemption rights have been precluded pursuant to RCW 61.12.093 et seq., or immediately after the time for redemption from such sale has expired in those instances in which there are redemption rights, as provided in RCW 6.23.060. In case the term of office of the sheriff or other officer making such sale shall have expired before a sufficient deed has been executed, then the successor in office of such sheriff shall, within the time specified in this section, execute and deliver to the purchaser or other person entitled to the same a deed of the premises so sold, and such deeds shall be as valid and effectual to convey to the grantee the lands or premises so sold, as if the deed had been made by the sheriff or other officer who made the sale.
