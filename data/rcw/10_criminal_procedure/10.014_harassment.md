## 10.14.010 - Legislative finding, intent. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
The legislature finds that serious, personal harassment through repeated invasions of a person's privacy by acts and words showing a pattern of harassment designed to coerce, intimidate, or humiliate the victim is increasing. The legislature further finds that the prevention of such harassment is an important governmental objective. This chapter is intended to provide victims with a speedy and inexpensive method of obtaining civil antiharassment protection orders preventing all further unwanted contact between the victim and the perpetrator.

\[ [1987 c 280 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c280.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20280%20§%201); \]

## 10.14.020 - Definitions. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Course of conduct" means a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. "Course of conduct" includes, in addition to any other form of communication, contact, or conduct, the sending of an electronic communication, but does not include constitutionally protected free speech. Constitutionally protected activity is not included within the meaning of "course of conduct."

2. "Unlawful harassment" means a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which seriously alarms, annoys, harasses, or is detrimental to such person, and which serves no legitimate or lawful purpose. The course of conduct shall be such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and shall actually cause substantial emotional distress to the petitioner, or, when the course of conduct would cause a reasonable parent to fear for the well-being of their child.

## 10.14.030 - Course of conduct—Determination of purpose. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
In determining whether the course of conduct serves any legitimate or lawful purpose, the court should consider whether:

1. Any current contact between the parties was initiated by the respondent only or was initiated by both parties;

2. The respondent has been given clear notice that all further contact with the petitioner is unwanted;

3. The respondent's course of conduct appears designed to alarm, annoy, or harass the petitioner;

4. The respondent is acting pursuant to any statutory authority, including but not limited to acts which are reasonably necessary to:

   a. Protect property or liberty interests;

   b. Enforce the law; or

   c. Meet specific statutory duties or requirements;

5. The respondent's course of conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the petitioner's privacy or the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive living environment for the petitioner;

6. Contact by the respondent with the petitioner or the petitioner's family has been limited in any manner by any previous court order.

\[ [1987 c 280 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c280.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20280%20§%203); \]

## 10.14.040 - Protection order—Petition. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
There shall exist an action known as a petition for an order for protection in cases of unlawful harassment.

1. A petition for relief shall allege the existence of harassment and shall be accompanied by an affidavit made under oath stating the specific facts and circumstances from which relief is sought.

2. A petition for relief may be made regardless of whether or not there is a pending lawsuit, complaint, petition, or other action between the parties.

3. All court clerks' offices shall make available simplified forms and instructional brochures. Any assistance or information provided by clerks under this section does not constitute the practice of law and clerks are not responsible for incorrect information contained in a petition.

4. Filing fees are set in RCW 36.18.020, but no filing fee may be charged for a petition filed in an existing action or under an existing cause number brought under this chapter in the jurisdiction where the relief is sought or as provided in RCW 10.14.055. Forms and instructional brochures shall be provided free of charge.

5. A person is not required to post a bond to obtain relief in any proceeding under this section.

6. The parent or guardian of a child under age eighteen may petition for an order of protection to restrain a person age eighteen years or over from contact with that child upon a showing that contact with the person to be enjoined is detrimental to the welfare of the child.

7. The parent or guardian of a child under the age of eighteen may petition in superior court for an order of protection to restrain a person under the age of eighteen years from contact with that child only in cases where the person to be restrained has been adjudicated of an offense against the child protected by the order, or is under investigation or has been investigated for such an offense. In issuing a protection order under this subsection, the court shall consider, among the other facts of the case, the severity of the alleged offense, any continuing physical danger or emotional distress to the alleged victim, and the expense, difficulty, and educational disruption that would be caused by a transfer of the alleged offender to another school. The court may order that the person restrained in the order not attend the public or approved private elementary, middle, or high school attended by the person under the age of eighteen years protected by the order. In the event that the court orders a transfer of the restrained person to another school, the parents or legal guardians of the person restrained in the order are responsible for transportation and other costs associated with the change of school by the person restrained in the order. The court shall send notice of the restriction on attending the same school as the person protected by the order to the public or approved private school the person restrained by the order will attend and to the school the person protected by the order attends.

## 10.14.080 - Antiharassment protection orders—Ex parte temporary—Hearing—Longer term, renewal—Acts not prohibited. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. Upon filing a petition for a civil antiharassment protection order under this chapter, the petitioner may obtain an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order. An ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order may be granted with or without notice upon the filing of an affidavit which, to the satisfaction of the court, shows reasonable proof of unlawful harassment of the petitioner by the respondent and that great or irreparable harm will result to the petitioner if the temporary antiharassment protection order is not granted. If the court declines to issue an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order, the court shall state the particular reasons for the court's denial. The court's denial of a motion for an ex parte temporary order shall be filed with the court.

2. An ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order shall be effective for a fixed period not to exceed fourteen days or twenty-four days if the court has permitted service by publication under RCW 10.14.085. The ex parte order may be reissued. A full hearing, as provided in this chapter, shall be set for not later than fourteen days from the issuance of the temporary order or not later than twenty-four days if service by publication is permitted. Except as provided in RCW 10.14.070 and 10.14.085, the respondent shall be personally served with a copy of the ex parte order along with a copy of the petition and notice of the date set for the hearing. The ex parte order and notice of hearing shall include at a minimum the date and time of the hearing set by the court to determine if the temporary order should be made effective for one year or more, and notice that if the respondent should fail to appear or otherwise not respond, an order for protection will be issued against the respondent pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, for a minimum of one year from the date of the hearing. The notice shall also include a brief statement of the provisions of the ex parte order and notify the respondent that a copy of the ex parte order and notice of hearing has been filed with the clerk of the court.

3. At the hearing, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that unlawful harassment exists, a civil antiharassment protection order shall issue prohibiting such unlawful harassment.

4. An order issued under this chapter shall be effective for not more than one year unless the court finds that the respondent is likely to resume unlawful harassment of the petitioner when the order expires. If so, the court may enter an order for a fixed time exceeding one year or may enter a permanent antiharassment protection order. The court shall not enter an order that is effective for more than one year if the order restrains the respondent from contacting the respondent's minor children. This limitation is not applicable to civil antiharassment protection orders issued under chapter 26.09, *26.10, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW. If the petitioner seeks relief for a period longer than one year on behalf of the respondent's minor children, the court shall advise the petitioner that the petitioner may apply for renewal of the order as provided in this chapter or if appropriate may seek relief pursuant to chapter 26.09 or * 26.10 RCW.

5. At any time within the three months before the expiration of the order, the petitioner may apply for a renewal of the order by filing a petition for renewal. The petition for renewal shall state the reasons why the petitioner seeks to renew the protection order. Upon receipt of the petition for renewal, the court shall order a hearing which shall be not later than fourteen days from the date of the order. Except as provided in RCW 10.14.085, personal service shall be made upon the respondent not less than five days before the hearing. If timely service cannot be made the court shall set a new hearing date and shall either require additional attempts at obtaining personal service or permit service by publication as provided by RCW 10.14.085. If the court permits service by publication, the court shall set the new hearing date not later than twenty-four days from the date of the order. If the order expires because timely service cannot be made the court shall grant an ex parte order of protection as provided in this section. The court shall grant the petition for renewal unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent will not resume harassment of the petitioner when the order expires. The court may renew the protection order for another fixed time period or may enter a permanent order as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

6. The court, in granting an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order or a civil antiharassment protection order, shall have broad discretion to grant such relief as the court deems proper, including an order:

   a. Restraining the respondent from making any attempts to contact the petitioner;

   b. Restraining the respondent from making any attempts to keep the petitioner under surveillance; and

   c. Requiring the respondent to stay a stated distance from the petitioner's residence and workplace.

7. In issuing the order, the court shall consider the provisions of RCW 9.41.800, and shall order the respondent to surrender, and prohibit the respondent from possessing, all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license as required in RCW 9.41.800.

8. The court in granting an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order or a civil antiharassment protection order shall not prohibit the respondent from exercising constitutionally protected free speech. Nothing in this section prohibits the petitioner from utilizing other civil or criminal remedies to restrain conduct or communications not otherwise constitutionally protected.

9. The court in granting an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order or a civil antiharassment protection order shall not prohibit the respondent from the use or enjoyment of real property to which the respondent has a cognizable claim unless that order is issued under chapter 26.09 RCW or under a separate action commenced with a summons and complaint to determine title or possession of real property.

10. The court in granting an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order or a civil antiharassment protection order shall not limit the respondent's right to care, control, or custody of the respondent's minor child, unless that order is issued under chapter 13.32A, 26.09, *26.10, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW.

11. A petitioner may not obtain an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order against a respondent if the petitioner has previously obtained two such ex parte orders against the same respondent but has failed to obtain the issuance of a civil antiharassment protection order unless good cause for such failure can be shown.

## 10.14.085 - Hearing reset after ex parte order—Service by publication—Circumstances. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. If the respondent was not personally served with the petition, notice of hearing, and ex parte order before the hearing, the court shall reset the hearing for twenty-four days from the date of entry of the order and may order service by publication instead of personal service under the following circumstances:

   a. The sheriff or municipal officer files an affidavit stating that the officer was unable to complete personal service upon the respondent. The affidavit must describe the number and types of attempts the officer made to complete service;

   b. The petitioner files an affidavit stating that the petitioner believes that the respondent is hiding from the server to avoid service. The petitioner's affidavit must state the reasons for the belief that the respondent is avoiding service;

   c. The server has deposited a copy of the summons, in substantially the form prescribed in subsection (3) of this section, notice of hearing, and the ex parte order of protection in the post office, directed to the respondent at the respondent's last known address, unless the server states that the server does not know the respondent's address; and

   d. The court finds reasonable grounds exist to believe that the respondent is concealing himself or herself to avoid service, and that further attempts to personally serve the respondent would be futile or unduly burdensome.

2. The court shall reissue the temporary order of protection not to exceed another twenty-four days from the date of reissuing the ex parte protection order and order to provide service by publication.

3. The publication shall be made in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the petition was brought and in the county of the last known address of the respondent once a week for three consecutive weeks. The newspaper selected must be one of the three most widely circulated papers in the county. The publication of summons shall not be made until the court orders service by publication under this section. Service of the summons shall be considered complete when the publication has been made for three consecutive weeks. The summons must be signed by the petitioner. The summons shall contain the date of the first publication, and shall require the respondent upon whom service by publication is desired, to appear and answer the petition on the date set for the hearing. The summons shall also contain a brief statement of the reason for the petition and a summary of the provisions under the ex parte order. The summons shall be essentially in the following form:

## 10.14.090 - Representation or appearance. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude either party from representation by private counsel or from appearing on his or her own behalf.

2. The court may require the respondent to pay the filing fee and court costs, including service fees, and to reimburse the petitioner for costs incurred in bringing the action, including a reasonable attorney's fee. If the petitioner has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, the court may require the respondent to pay the filing fee and costs, including services fees, to the county or municipality incurring the expense.

If the order includes a requirement under RCW 9.41.800 for the immediate surrender of all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license, the order must be served by a law enforcement officer.

3. If the sheriff or municipal peace officer cannot complete service upon the respondent within ten days, the sheriff or municipal peace officer shall notify the petitioner.

4. Returns of service under this chapter shall be made in accordance with the applicable court rules.

5. If an order entered by the court recites that the respondent appeared in person before the court, the necessity for further service is waived and proof of service of that order is not necessary. The court's order, entered after a hearing, need not be served on a respondent who fails to appear before the court, if material terms of the order have not changed from those contained in the temporary order, and it is shown to the court's satisfaction that the respondent has previously been personally served with the temporary order.

6. Except in cases where the petitioner has fees waived under RCW 10.14.055 or is granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, municipal police departments serving documents as required under this chapter may collect the same fees for service and mileage authorized by RCW 36.18.040 to be collected by sheriffs.

7. If the court previously entered an order allowing service by publication of the notice of hearing and temporary order of protection pursuant to RCW 10.14.085, the court may permit service by publication of the order of protection issued under RCW 10.14.080. Service by publication must comply with the requirements of RCW 10.14.085.

1. A copy of an antiharassment protection order granted under this chapter shall be forwarded by the clerk of the court on or before the next judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order.

Upon receipt of the order, the law enforcement agency shall forthwith enter the order into any computer-based criminal intelligence information system available in this state used by law enforcement agencies to list outstanding warrants. The law enforcement agency shall expunge expired orders from the computer system. Entry into the law enforcement information system constitutes notice to all law enforcement agencies of the existence of the order. The order is fully enforceable in any county in the state.

2. When a peace officer investigates a report of an alleged violation of an order for protection issued under this chapter the officer shall attempt to determine whether the respondent knew of the existence of the protection order. If the officer determines that the respondent did not or probably did not know about the protection order, the officer shall make reasonable efforts to obtain a copy of the protection order and serve it on the respondent during the investigation.

The legislature respectfully requests that:

1. By January 1, 2014, the administrative office of the courts shall develop a single master petition pattern form for all antiharassment and stalking protection orders issued under chapter 7.92 RCW and this chapter.

An antiharassment order and stalking protection order issued under chapter 7.92 RCW and this chapter must substantially comply with the pattern form developed by the administrative office of the courts.

2. The Washington state supreme court gender and justice commission, to the extent it is able, in consultation with Washington coalition of sexual assault programs, Washington state coalition against domestic violence, Washington association of prosecuting attorneys, Washington association of criminal defense lawyers, and Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, consider other potential solutions to reduce confusion about which type of protection order a petitioner should seek and to provide any recommendations to the legislature by January 1, 2014.
