## 10.01.090 - Entities—Judgment against.
1. An entity convicted of an offense may be ordered to pay legal financial obligations, including restitution, crime victims' assessments, costs, fines, penalties, and other assessments authorized or required by law. Legal financial obligations imposed upon an entity shall be entered and docketed by the clerk, or district or municipal court as a judgment against the entity, and it shall be of the same force and effect and be enforced against such entity in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. Notwithstanding any other provisions pertaining to legal financial obligations, all legal financial obligations imposed in a judgment against an entity under this section bear interest from the date of the judgment until payment at the rate applicable to civil judgments under RCW 4.56.110.

2. Except as otherwise provided under subsection (1) of this section, payments on legal financial obligations must be collected and distributed according to the requirements under RCW 3.50.100, 3.62.020, 3.62.040, 9.92.070, 9.94A.760, 10.01.160, 10.01.170, 10.01.180, 10.46.190, 10.64.015, 10.73.160, 10.82.090, 35.20.220, and any other sections applicable to legal financial obligations imposed as a result of a criminal conviction.

   c. Five hundred thousand dollars for a class C felony;

   d. Two hundred fifty thousand dollars for a gross misdemeanor; and

\[ [2019 c 211 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1252.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20211%20§%205); [1925 ex.s. c 101 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1925ex1c101.pdf?cite=1925%20ex.s.%20c%20101%20§%201); RRS § 2011-4; \]

## 10.01.120 - Pardons—Reprieves—Commutations.

## 10.01.150 - Charges arising from official acts of state officers or employees—Defense by attorney general.
Whenever a state officer or employee is charged with a criminal offense arising out of the performance of an official act which was fully in conformity with established written rules, policies, and guidelines of the state or state agency, the employing agency may request the attorney general to defend the officer or employee. If the agency finds, and the attorney general concurs, that the officer's or employee's conduct was fully in accordance with established written rules, policies, and guidelines of the state or a state agency and the act performed was within the scope of employment, then the request shall be granted and the costs of defense shall be paid by the requesting agency: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, If the agency head is the person charged, then approval must be obtained from both the attorney general and the state auditor. If the court finds that the officer or employee was performing an official act, or was within the scope of employment, and that his or her actions were in conformity with the established rules, regulations, policies, and guidelines of the state and the state agency, the cost of any monetary fine assessed shall be paid from the liability account.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 1005](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%201005); [1999 c 163 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2111-S.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%20163%20§%206); [1975 1st ex.s. c 144 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1975ex1c144.pdf?cite=1975%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20144%20§%201); \]

## 10.01.160 - Costs—What constitutes—Payment by defendant—Procedure—Remission—Medical or mental health treatment or services. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the court may require a defendant to pay costs. Costs may be imposed only upon a convicted defendant, except for costs imposed upon a defendant's entry into a deferred prosecution program, costs imposed upon a defendant for pretrial supervision, or costs imposed upon a defendant for preparing and serving a warrant for failure to appear.

2. Costs shall be limited to expenses specially incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant or in administering the deferred prosecution program under chapter 10.05 RCW or pretrial supervision. They cannot include expenses inherent in providing a constitutionally guaranteed jury trial or expenditures in connection with the maintenance and operation of government agencies that must be made by the public irrespective of specific violations of law. Expenses incurred for serving of warrants for failure to appear and jury fees under RCW 10.46.190 may be included in costs the court may require a defendant to pay. Costs for administering a deferred prosecution may not exceed two hundred fifty dollars. Costs for administering a pretrial supervision other than a pretrial electronic alcohol monitoring program, drug monitoring program, or 24/7 sobriety program may not exceed one hundred fifty dollars. Costs for preparing and serving a warrant for failure to appear may not exceed one hundred dollars. Costs of incarceration imposed on a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor or a gross misdemeanor may not exceed the actual cost of incarceration. In no case may the court require the offender to pay more than one hundred dollars per day for the cost of incarceration. Payment of other court-ordered financial obligations, including all legal financial obligations and costs of supervision take precedence over the payment of the cost of incarceration ordered by the court. All funds received from defendants for the cost of incarceration in the county or city jail must be remitted for criminal justice purposes to the county or city that is responsible for the defendant's jail costs. Costs imposed constitute a judgment against a defendant and survive a dismissal of the underlying action against the defendant. However, if the defendant is acquitted on the underlying action, the costs for preparing and serving a warrant for failure to appear do not survive the acquittal, and the judgment that such costs would otherwise constitute shall be vacated.

3. The court shall not order a defendant to pay costs if the defendant at the time of sentencing is indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c). In determining the amount and method of payment of costs for defendants who are not indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c), the court shall take account of the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose.

4. A defendant who has been ordered to pay costs and who is not in contumacious default in the payment thereof may at any time after release from total confinement petition the sentencing court for remission of the payment of costs or of any unpaid portion thereof. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may remit all or part of the amount due in costs, modify the method of payment under RCW 10.01.170, or convert the unpaid costs to community restitution hours, if the jurisdiction operates a community restitution program, at the rate of no less than the state minimum wage established in RCW 49.46.020 for each hour of community restitution. Manifest hardship exists where the defendant is indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c).

5. Except for direct costs relating to evaluating and reporting to the court, prosecutor, or defense counsel regarding a defendant's competency to stand trial as provided in RCW 10.77.060, this section shall not apply to costs related to medical or mental health treatment or services a defendant receives while in custody of the secretary of the department of social and health services or other governmental units. This section shall not prevent the secretary of the department of social and health services or other governmental units from imposing liability and seeking reimbursement from a defendant committed to an appropriate facility as provided in RCW 10.77.084 while criminal proceedings are stayed. This section shall also not prevent governmental units from imposing liability on defendants for costs related to providing medical or mental health treatment while the defendant is in the governmental unit's custody. Medical or mental health treatment and services a defendant receives at a state hospital or other facility are not a cost of prosecution and shall be recoverable under RCW 10.77.250 and 70.48.130, chapter 43.20B RCW, and any other applicable statute.

## 10.01.170 - Fine or costs—Payment within specified time or installments—Payment priority order. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. When a defendant is sentenced to pay fines, penalties, assessments, fees, restitution, or costs, the court may grant permission for payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. If the court finds that the defendant is indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c), the court shall grant permission for payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. If no such permission is included in the sentence the fine or costs shall be payable forthwith.

2. An offender's monthly payment shall be applied in the following order of priority until satisfied:

   a. First, proportionally to restitution to victims that have not been fully compensated from other sources;

   b. Second, proportionally to restitution to insurance or other sources with respect to a loss that has provided compensation to victims;

   c. Third, proportionally to crime victims' assessments; and

   d. Fourth, proportionally to costs, fines, and other assessments required by law.

## 10.01.180 - Fine or costs—Default in payment—Contempt of court—Enforcement, collection procedures. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
1. A defendant sentenced to pay any fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs who willfully defaults in the payment thereof or of any installment is in contempt of court as provided in chapter 7.21 RCW. The court may issue a warrant of arrest for his or her appearance.

2. When any fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or assessment of costs is imposed on a corporation or unincorporated association, it is the duty of the person authorized to make disbursement from the assets of the corporation or association to pay the obligation from those assets, and his or her failure to do so may be held to be contempt.

3. [Empty]

   a. The court shall not sanction a defendant for contempt based on failure to pay fines, penalties, assessments, fees, or costs unless the court finds, after a hearing and on the record, that the failure to pay is willful. A failure to pay is willful if the defendant has the current ability to pay but refuses to do so.

   b. In determining whether the defendant has the current ability to pay, the court shall inquire into and consider: (i) The defendant's income and assets; (ii) the defendant's basic living costs as defined by RCW 10.101.010 and other liabilities including child support and other legal financial obligations; and (iii) the defendant's bona fide efforts to acquire additional resources. A defendant who is indigent as defined by RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c) is presumed to lack the current ability to pay.

   c. If the court determines that the defendant is homeless or a person who is mentally ill, as defined in RCW 71.24.025, failure to pay a legal financial obligation is not willful contempt and shall not subject the defendant to penalties.

4. If a term of imprisonment for contempt for nonpayment of any fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs is ordered, the term of imprisonment shall be set forth in the commitment order, and shall not exceed one day for each twenty-five dollars of the amount ordered, thirty days if the amount ordered of costs was imposed upon conviction of a violation or misdemeanor, or one year in any other case, whichever is the shorter period. A person committed for nonpayment of any fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs shall be given credit toward payment for each day of imprisonment at the rate specified in the commitment order.

5. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the default in the payment of any fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs is not willful contempt, the court may, and if the defendant is indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c), the court shall enter an order: (a) Allowing the defendant additional time for payment; (b) reducing the amount thereof or of each installment; (c) revoking the fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in part; or (d) converting the unpaid fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs to community restitution hours, if the jurisdiction operates a community restitution program, at the rate of no less than the state minimum wage established in RCW 49.46.020 for each hour of community restitution. The crime victim penalty assessment under RCW 7.68.035 may not be reduced, revoked, or converted to community restitution hours.

6. A default in the payment of any fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs or any installment thereof may be collected by any means authorized by law for the enforcement of a judgment. The levy of execution for the collection of any fine, penalty, assessment, fee, or costs shall not discharge a defendant committed to imprisonment for contempt until the amount has actually been collected.
