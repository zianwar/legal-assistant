If a grand juror knows or has reason to believe that an indictable offense, triable within the county, has been committed, he or she shall declare such a fact to his or her fellow jurors who may begin an investigation. In such investigation the grand juror may be sworn as a witness.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 1022](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%201022); [1971 ex.s. c 67 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c67.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2067%20§%2010); \]

## 10.27.120 - Self-incrimination—Right to counsel.
Any individual called to testify before a grand jury or special inquiry judge, whether as a witness or principal, if not represented by an attorney appearing with the witness before the grand jury or special inquiry judge, must be told of his or her privilege against self-incrimination. Such an individual has a right to representation by an attorney to advise him or her as to his or her rights, obligations, and duties before the grand jury or special inquiry judge, and must be informed of this right. The attorney may be present during all proceedings attended by his or her client unless immunity has been granted pursuant to RCW 10.27.130. After immunity has been granted, such an individual may leave the grand jury room to confer with his or her attorney.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 1023](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%201023); [1971 ex.s. c 67 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c67.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2067%20§%2012); \]

## 10.27.130 - Self-incrimination—Refusal to testify or give evidence—Procedure.
If in any proceedings before a grand jury or special inquiry judge, a person refuses, or indicates in advance a refusal, to testify or provide evidence of any other kind on the ground that he or she may be incriminated thereby, and if a public attorney requests the court to order that person to testify or provide the evidence, the court shall then hold a hearing and shall so order unless it finds that to do so would be clearly contrary to the public interest, and that person shall comply with the order. The hearing shall be subject to the provisions of RCW 10.27.080 and 10.27.090, unless the witness shall request that the hearing be public.

If, but for this section, he or she would have been privileged to withhold the answer given or the evidence produced by him or her, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his or her privilege against self-incrimination; but he or she shall not be prosecuted or subjected to criminal penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or fact concerning which he or she has been ordered to testify pursuant to this section. He or she may nevertheless be prosecuted for failing to comply with the order to answer, or for perjury or for offering false evidence to the grand jury.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 1024](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%201024); [1971 ex.s. c 67 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c67.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2067%20§%2013); \]

## 10.27.140 - Witnesses—Attendance.
1. Except as provided in this section, no person has the right to appear as a witness in a grand jury or special inquiry judge proceeding.

2. A public attorney may call as a witness in a grand jury or special inquiry judge proceeding any person believed by him or her to possess information or knowledge relevant thereto and may issue legal process and subpoena to compel his or her attendance and the production of evidence.

3. The grand jury or special inquiry judge may cause to be called as a witness any person believed by it to possess relevant information or knowledge. If the grand jury or special inquiry judge desires to hear any such witness who was not called by a public attorney, it may direct a public attorney to issue and serve a subpoena upon such witness and the public attorney must comply with such direction. At any time after service of such subpoena and before the return date thereof, however, the public attorney may apply to the court which impaneled the grand jury for an order vacating or modifying the subpoena on the grounds that such is in the public interest. Upon such application, the court may in its discretion vacate the subpoena, extend its return date, attach reasonable conditions to directions, or make such other qualification thereof as is appropriate.

4. The proceedings to summon a person and compel him or her to testify or provide evidence shall as far as possible be the same as proceedings to summon witnesses and compel their attendance. Such persons shall receive only those fees paid witnesses in superior court criminal trials.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 1025](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%201025); [1971 ex.s. c 67 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c67.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2067%20§%2014); \]

## 10.27.150 - Indictments—Issuance.
After hearing, examining, and investigating the evidence before it, a grand jury may, in its discretion, issue an indictment against a principal. A grand jury shall find an indictment only when from all the evidence at least three-fourths of the jurors are convinced that there is probable cause to believe a principal is guilty of a criminal offense. When an indictment is found by a grand jury the foreperson or acting foreperson shall present it to the court.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 1026](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%201026); [1971 ex.s. c 67 § 15](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c67.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2067%20§%2015); \]

## 10.27.160 - Grand jury report.
The grand jury may prepare its conclusions, recommendations and suggestions in the form of a grand jury report. Such report shall be released to the public only upon a determination by a majority of the judges of the superior court of the county court that (1) the findings in the report deal with matters of broad public policy affecting the public interest and do not identify or criticize any individual; (2) the release of the report would be consistent with the public interest and further the ends of justice; and (3) release of the report would not prejudice any pending criminal investigation or trial.

\[ [1971 ex.s. c 67 § 16](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c67.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2067%20§%2016); \]

## 10.27.170 - Special inquiry judge—Petition for order—Investigation of sexual exploitation of children.
1. When any public attorney, corporation counsel or city attorney has reason to suspect crime or corruption, within the jurisdiction of such attorney, and there is reason to believe that there are persons who may be able to give material testimony or provide material evidence concerning such suspected crime or corruption, such attorney may petition the judge designated as a special inquiry judge pursuant to RCW 10.27.050 for an order directed to such persons commanding them to appear at a designated time and place in said county and to then and there answer such questions concerning the suspected crime or corruption as the special inquiry judge may approve, or provide evidence as directed by the special inquiry judge.

## 10.27.180 - Special inquiry judge—Disqualification from subsequent proceedings.
The judge serving as a special inquiry judge shall be disqualified from acting as a magistrate or judge in any subsequent court proceeding arising from such inquiry except alleged contempt for neglect or refusal to appear, testify or provide evidence at such inquiry in response to an order, summons or subpoena.

\[ [1971 ex.s. c 67 § 18](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c67.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%2067%20§%2018); \]

## 10.27.190 - Special inquiry judge—Direction to public attorney for proceedings in another county—Procedure.
