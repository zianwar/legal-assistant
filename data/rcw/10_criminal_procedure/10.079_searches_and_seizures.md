4. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, no person may be present or observe during the search unless the person is necessary to conduct the search or to ensure the safety of those persons conducting the search.

5. Nothing in this section prohibits a person upon whom a body cavity search is to be performed from having a readily available person of his or her choosing present at the time the search is conducted. However, the person chosen shall not be a person being held in custody by a law enforcement agency.

RCW 10.79.130 through 10.79.160 do not apply to a person held for post-conviction incarceration for a criminal offense.

## 10.79.130 - Strip, body cavity searches—Warrant required—Exceptions.
1. No person to whom this section is made applicable by RCW 10.79.120 may be strip searched without a warrant unless:

   a. There is a reasonable suspicion to believe that a strip search is necessary to discover weapons, criminal evidence, contraband, or other thing concealed on the body of the person to be searched, that constitutes a threat to the security of a holding, detention, or local correctional facility;

   b. There is probable cause to believe that a strip search is necessary to discover other criminal evidence concealed on the body of the person to be searched, but not constituting a threat to facility security; or

   c. There is a reasonable suspicion to believe that a strip search is necessary to discover a health condition requiring immediate medical attention.

2. For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, a reasonable suspicion is deemed to be present when the person to be searched has been arrested for:

   a. A violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 or any successor statute;

   b. An offense involving escape, burglary, or the use of a deadly weapon; or

   c. An offense involving possession of a drug or controlled substance under chapter 69.41, 69.50, or 69.52 RCW or any successor statute.

1. A person to whom this section is made applicable by RCW 10.79.120 who has not been arrested for an offense within one of the categories specified in RCW 10.79.130(2) may nevertheless be strip searched, but only upon an individualized determination of reasonable suspicion or probable cause as provided in this section.

2. With the exception of those situations in which reasonable suspicion is deemed to be present under RCW 10.79.130(2), no strip search may be conducted without the specific prior written approval of the jail unit supervisor on duty. Before any strip search is conducted, reasonable efforts must be made to use other less-intrusive means, such as pat-down, electronic metal detector, or clothing searches, to determine whether a weapon, criminal evidence, contraband, or other thing is concealed on the body, or whether a health condition requiring immediate medical attention is present. The determination of whether reasonable suspicion or probable cause exists to conduct a strip search shall be made only after such less-intrusive means have been used and shall be based on a consideration of all information and circumstances known to the officer authorizing the strip search, including but not limited to the following factors:

   a. The nature of the offense for which the person to be searched was arrested;

   b. The prior criminal record of the person to be searched; and

   c. Physically violent behavior of the person to be searched, during or after the arrest.

\[ [1986 c 88 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c88.pdf?cite=1986%20c%2088%20§%203); \]

## 10.79.150 - Strip, body cavity searches—Written record required, contents—Unnecessary persons prohibited.
1. A written record of any strip search shall be maintained in the individual file of each person strip searched.

2. With respect to any strip search conducted under RCW 10.79.140, the record shall contain the following information:

   a. The name of the supervisor authorizing the strip search;

   b. The specific facts constituting reasonable suspicion to believe that the strip search was necessary;

   c. The name and serial number of the officer conducting the strip search and of all other persons present or observing during any part of the strip search;

   d. The time, date, and place of the strip search; and

   e. Any weapons, criminal evidence, contraband, or other thing, or health condition discovered as a result of the strip search.

3. With respect to any strip search conducted under RCW 10.79.130(2), the record shall contain, in addition to the offense or offenses for which the person searched was arrested, the information required by subsection (2)(c), (d), and (e) of this section.

4. The record may be included or incorporated in existing forms used by the facility, including the booking form required under the Washington Administrative Code. A notation of the name of the person strip searched shall also be entered in the log of daily activities or other chronological record, if any, maintained pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code.

5. Except at the request of the person to be searched, no person may be present or observe during the strip search unless necessary to conduct the search.

## 10.79.170 - Strip, body cavity searches—Nonliability when search delayed.
No governmental entity and no employee or contracting agent of a governmental entity shall be liable for injury, death, or damage caused by a person in custody when the injury, death, or damage is caused by or made possible by contraband that would have been discovered sooner but for the delay caused by having to seek a search warrant under RCW 10.79.080 or 10.79.130 through 10.79.160.
