## 10.66.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that drug abuse is escalating at an alarming rate. New protections need to be established to address this drug crisis which is threatening every stratum of our society. Prohibiting known drug traffickers from frequenting areas for continuous drug activity is one means of addressing this pervasive problem.

\[ [1989 c 271 § 213](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c271.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20271%20§%20213); \]

   a. A "family or household member" or "intimate partner" as defined in RCW 7.105.010, who has a possessory interest in a residence as an owner or tenant, at least as great as a known drug trafficker's interest;

   b. An owner or lessor;

   c. An owner, tenant, or resident who lives or works in a designated PADT area; or

   d. A city or prosecuting attorney for any jurisdiction in this state where drug trafficking is occurring.

2. "Drug" or "drugs" means a controlled substance as defined in chapter 69.50 RCW or an "imitation controlled substance" as defined in RCW 69.52.020.

3. "Known drug trafficker" means any person who has been convicted of a drug offense in this state, another state, or federal court who subsequently has been arrested for a drug offense in this state. For purposes of this definition, "drug offense" means a felony violation of chapter 69.50 or 69.52 RCW or equivalent law in another jurisdiction that involves the manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to manufacture or distribute of a controlled substance or imitation controlled substance.

The perimeters of a PADT area shall be defined using street names and numbers and shall include all real property contained therein, where drug sales, possession of drugs, pedestrian or vehicular traffic attendant to drug activity, or other activity associated with drug offenses confirms a pattern associated with drug trafficking.

Upon the filing of an application for an off-limits order under RCW 10.66.020 (1), (2), or (3), the court shall set a hearing fourteen days from the filing of the application, or as soon thereafter as the hearing can be scheduled.

## 10.66.040 - Ex parte temporary order—Hearing—Notice.
Upon filing an application for an off-limits order under this chapter, an applicant may obtain an ex parte temporary off-limits order, with or without notice, only upon a showing that serious or irreparable harm will result to the applicant if the temporary off-limits order is not granted. An ex parte temporary off-limits order shall be effective for a fixed period not to exceed fourteen days, but the court may reissue the order upon a showing of good cause. A hearing on a one-year off-limits order, as provided in this chapter, shall be set for fourteen days from the issuance of the temporary order. The respondent shall be personally served with a copy of the temporary off-limits order along with a copy of the application and notice of the date set for the full hearing.

The court in its discretion may allow a respondent, who is the subject of any order issued under RCW 10.66.020 as part of a civil or criminal proceeding, to enter an off-limits area or areas for health or employment reasons, subject to conditions prescribed by the court.
