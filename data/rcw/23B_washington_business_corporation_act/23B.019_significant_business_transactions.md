## 23B.19.010 - Legislative findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that:

1. Corporations that offer employment and health, retirement, and other benefits to citizens of the state of Washington are vital to the economy of this state and the well-being of all of its citizens;

2. The welfare of the employees of these corporations is of paramount interest and concern to this state;

3. Many businesses in this state rely on these corporations to purchase goods and services;

4. Hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control of or influence otherwise publicly held corporations can cause corporate management to dissipate a corporation's assets in an effort to resist the takeover by selling or distributing cash or assets, redeeming stock, or taking other steps to increase the short-term gain to shareholders and to dissipate energies required for strategic planning, market development, capital investment decisions, assessment of technologies, and evaluation of competitive challenges that can damage the long-term interests of shareholders and the economic health of the state by reducing or eliminating the ability to finance investments in research and development, new products, facilities and equipment, and by undermining the planning process for those purposes;

5. Hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control or influence otherwise publicly held corporations are often highly leveraged pursuant to financing arrangements which assume that an acquirer will promptly obtain access to an acquired corporation's cash or assets and use them, or the proceeds of their sale, to repay acquisition indebtedness;

6. Hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control of or influence otherwise publicly held corporations can harm the economy of the state by weakening corporate performance, and causing unemployment, plant closings, reduced charitable donations, declining population base, reduced income to fee-supported local government services, reduced tax base, and reduced income to other businesses; and

7. The state has a substantial and legitimate interest in regulating domestic corporations and those foreign corporations that have their most significant business contacts with this state and in regulating hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control of or influence otherwise publicly held domestic corporations and those foreign corporations that employ a large number of citizens of the state, pay significant taxes, and have a substantial economic base in the state.

The legislature intends this chapter to balance the substantial and legitimate interests of the state in domestic corporations and those foreign corporations that employ a large number of citizens of the state and that have a substantial economic base in the state with: The interests of citizens of other states who own shares of such corporations; the interests of the state of incorporation of such foreign corporations in regulating the internal affairs of corporations incorporated in that state; and the interests of promoting interstate commerce. To this effect, the legislature intends to regulate certain transactions between publicly held corporations and acquiring persons that will tend to harm the long-term health of domestic corporations and of foreign corporations that have their principal executive office and a majority of their assets in this state and that employ a large number of citizens of this state.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Acquiring person" means a person or group of persons, other than the target corporation or a subsidiary of the target corporation, who is the beneficial owner of voting shares entitled to cast votes comprising ten percent or more of the voting power of the target corporation; provided, however, that the term "acquiring person" does not include any person who (a) beneficially owned voting shares entitled to cast votes comprising ten percent or more of the voting power of the target corporation on March 23, 1988; (b) acquired its voting shares of the target corporation solely by gift, inheritance, or in a transaction in which no consideration is exchanged; (c) equals or exceeds the ten percent threshold as a result of action taken solely by the target corporation, such as redemption of shares, unless that person, by its own action, acquires additional voting shares of the target corporation; (d) beneficially owned voting shares entitled to cast votes comprising ten percent or more of the voting power of the target corporation prior to the time the target corporation had a class of voting shares registered with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section 12 or 15 of the exchange act; or (e) beneficially owned voting shares entitled to cast votes comprising ten percent or more of the voting power of the target corporation prior to the time the target corporation amended its articles of incorporation to provide that the corporation shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. An agent, bank, broker, nominee, or trustee for another person, if the other person is not an acquiring person, who acts in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter, is not an acquiring person. For the purpose of determining whether a person is an acquiring person, the number of voting shares of the target corporation that are outstanding shall include voting shares beneficially owned by the person through application of subsection (4) of this section, but shall not include any other unissued voting shares of the target corporation which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding; or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants, or options; or otherwise.

             II. The power to dispose, or to direct the disposition of, the shares, directly or indirectly;

             III. The right to acquire the shares, whether the right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time, pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise; or

             IV. The right to vote the shares pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing; or

         B.  Has any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing of the shares with any other person who beneficially owns, or whose affiliates or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, the shares.

          A.  A person is not the beneficial owner of shares under (a)(i)(A)(III) of this subsection with respect to shares tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by the person or any of the person's affiliates or associates until the tendered shares are accepted for purchase or exchange.

          B.  A person is not the beneficial owner of any shares under (a)(i)(A)(IV) of this subsection if the agreement, arrangement, or understanding to vote the shares arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations under the exchange act and is not then reportable on schedule 13D under the exchange act, or any comparable or successor report.

          C.  A person is not the beneficial owner of any shares under (a)(i)(B) of this subsection if the agreement, arrangement, or understanding for the purpose of voting the shares arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations under the exchange act and is not then reportable on schedule 13D under the exchange act, or any comparable or successor report.

A person's beneficial ownership of voting shares entitled to cast votes comprising ten percent or more of the voting power of a domestic or foreign corporation shall create a rebuttable presumption that such person has control of such corporation. However, a person does not have control of a domestic or foreign corporation if the person holds voting shares, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian, or trustee for one or more beneficial owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such corporation.

13.

14. "Share acquisition time" means the time at which a person first becomes an acquiring person of a target corporation.

15. "Shares" means any:

    a. Shares or similar security, any certificate of interest, any participation in any profit sharing agreement, any voting trust certificate, or any certificate of deposit for shares; and

    b. Security convertible, with or without consideration, into shares, or any warrant, call, or other option or privilege of buying shares without being bound to do so, or any other security carrying any right to acquire, subscribe to, or purchase shares.

16. "Significant business transaction" means:

    a. A merger, share exchange, or consolidation of a target corporation or a subsidiary of a target corporation with (i) an acquiring person, or (ii) any other domestic or foreign corporation which is, or after the merger, share exchange, or consolidation would be, an affiliate or associate of the acquiring person;

For the purposes of (c) of this subsection, a termination other than an employee's death or disability or bona fide voluntary retirement, transfer, resignation, termination for cause under applicable common law principles, or leave of absence shall be presumed to be a termination resulting from the acquiring person's acquisition of shares, which presumption is rebuttable. A bona fide voluntary transfer of employees between the target corporation and its subsidiaries or between its subsidiaries is not a termination for the purposes of (c) of this subsection;

    d. The issuance, transfer, or redemption by a target corporation or a subsidiary of a target corporation, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, of shares or of options, warrants, or rights to acquire shares of a target corporation or a subsidiary of a target corporation to or beneficially owned by an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person except pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights to purchase shares offered, or a dividend, distribution, or redemption paid or made pro rata to, all shareholders or holders of options, warrants, or rights to acquire shares of the target corporation, and except for involuntary redemptions permitted by the target corporation's charter or by the law of this state or the state of incorporation;

      ii. The highest preferential amount per share to which the holders of shares of the same class or series of shares are entitled in the event of any voluntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the target corporation, plus the aggregate amount of any dividends declared or due as to which the holders are entitled prior to payment of dividends on some other class or series of shares, unless the aggregate amount of the dividends is included in the preferential amount; and

The significant business transaction is approved at an annual meeting of shareholders, or special meeting of shareholders called for such a purpose, no earlier than five years after the acquiring person's share acquisition time, by a majority of the votes entitled to be counted within each voting group entitled to vote separately on the transaction. The votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote under this title or the articles of incorporation shall be entitled to be counted under this subsection except that the votes of shares as to which an acquiring person has beneficial ownership or voting control may not be counted to determine whether shareholders have approved a transaction for purposes of this subsection. The votes of shares as to which an acquiring person has beneficial ownership or voting control shall, however, be counted in determining whether a transaction is approved under other sections of this title and for purposes of determining a quorum.

3. Subsection (2) of this section does not apply to a target corporation that on June 6, 1996, had a provision in its articles of incorporation, adopted under *RCW 23B.17.020(3)(d), expressly electing not to be covered under *RCW 23B.17.020, which is repealed by section 6, chapter 155, Laws of 1996.

4. A significant business transaction that is made in violation of subsection (1) or (2) of this section and that is not exempt under RCW 23B.19.030 is void.
