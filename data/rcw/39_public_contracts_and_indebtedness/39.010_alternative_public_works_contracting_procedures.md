## 39.10.200 - Finding—Purpose—Intent.
The legislature finds that the traditional process of awarding public works contracts in lump sum to the lowest responsible bidder is a fair and objective method of selecting a contractor. However, under certain circumstances, alternative public works contracting procedures may best serve the public interest if such procedures are implemented in an open and fair process based on objective and equitable criteria. The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the use of certain supplemental alternative public works contracting procedures, to prescribe appropriate requirements to ensure that such contracting procedures serve the public interest, and to establish a process for evaluation of such contracting procedures. It is the intent of the legislature to establish that, unless otherwise specifically provided for in law, public bodies may use only those alternative public works contracting procedures specifically authorized in this chapter, subject to the requirements of this chapter.

## 39.10.380 - General contractor/construction manager procedure—Subcontract bidding procedure.
1. All subcontract work and equipment and material purchases shall be competitively bid with public bid openings and require the public solicitation of the bid documents. At a minimum, the general contractor/construction manager shall publish at least once in a legal newspaper of general circulation published in, or as near as possible to, that part of the county in which the subcontract work will be performed, a notice of its request for bid, and the availability and location of the bid documents. The general contractor/construction manager is encouraged to post the subcontract opportunity in additional areas beyond the legal newspaper as required by this subsection, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize the opportunity for qualified subcontractors. Subcontract bid packages and equipment and materials purchases shall be awarded to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid. In preparing subcontract bid packages, the general contractor/construction manager shall not be required to violate or waive terms of a collective bargaining agreement. Individual bid packages are to be prepared with trades separated in the manner consistent with industry practice to maximize participation and competition across all trades. Bundling of trades not normally combined into one bid package is not allowed without justification and specific approval by the public body. Bid packages must be prepared to reduce barriers for and increase participation by disadvantaged business enterprises.

2. All subcontract bid packages in which bidder eligibility was not determined in advance shall include the specific objective criteria that will be used by the general contractor/construction manager and the public body to evaluate bidder responsibility. If the lowest bidder submitting a responsive bid is determined by the general contractor/construction manager and the public body not to be responsible, the general contractor/construction manager and the public body must provide written documentation to that bidder explaining their intent to reject the bidder as not responsible and afford the bidder the opportunity to establish that it is a responsible bidder. Responsibility shall be determined in accordance with criteria listed in the bid documents. Protests concerning bidder responsibility determination by the general contractor/construction manager and the public body shall be in accordance with subsection (4) of this section.

3. All subcontractors who bid work over $300,000 shall post a bid bond. All subcontractors who are awarded a contract over $300,000 shall provide a performance and payment bond for the contract amount. All other subcontractors shall provide a performance and payment bond if required by the general contractor/construction manager.

4. If the general contractor/construction manager receives a written protest from a subcontractor bidder or an equipment or material supplier, the general contractor/construction manager shall not execute a contract for the subcontract bid package or equipment or material purchase order with anyone other than the protesting bidder without first providing at least two full business days' written notice to all bidders of the intent to execute a contract for the subcontract bid package. The protesting bidder must submit written notice of its protest no later than two full business days following the bid opening. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are not counted.

5. A low bidder who claims error and fails to enter into a contract is prohibited from bidding on the same project if a second or subsequent call for bids is made for the project.

6. The general contractor/construction manager may negotiate with the lowest responsible and responsive bidder to negotiate an adjustment to the lowest bid or proposal price to reduce cost based upon agreed changes to the contract plans and specifications under the following conditions:

   a. All responsive bids or proposal prices exceed the published bid package estimates; and

   b. The apparent low responsive bid or proposal does not exceed the published bid package estimates by more than 10 percent.

7. If the negotiation is unsuccessful, the subcontract work or equipment or material purchases must be rebid.

8. The general contractor/construction manager must provide a written explanation to the public body if all bids are rejected.

## 39.10.385 - General contractor/construction manager procedure—Alternative subcontractor selection process.
The selection process in this section may be used by public bodies certified under RCW 39.10.270. It may also be used by noncertified public bodies if this selection process has been approved for the project by the project review committee. As an alternative to the subcontractor selection process outlined in RCW 39.10.380, a general contractor/construction manager may, with the approval of the public body, select one or more subcontractors using the process outlined in this section. This alternative selection process may only be used when the anticipated value of the subcontract will exceed three million dollars. When using the alternative selection process, the general contractor/construction manager should select the subcontractor early in the life of the public works project.

1. In order to use this alternative selection process, the general contractor/construction manager and the public body must determine that it is in the best interest of the public. In making this determination the general contractor/construction manager and the public body must:

   a. Publish a notice of intent to use this alternative selection process in the same legal newspaper where the public solicitation of proposals is published. The general contractor/construction manager and public body are encouraged to post the notice in additional areas beyond the legal newspaper as required under this subsection, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize the intent to use this alternative selection process.

The evaluation criteria, weights assigned to each criteria, and justification for using this selection process must be made available upon request at least seven calendar days before the public hearing;

   b. Conduct a hearing and provide an opportunity for any interested party to submit written and verbal comments regarding the justification for using this selection process, the evaluation criteria, weights for each criteria, and protest procedures;

   c. After the public hearing, consider the written and verbal comments received and determine if using this alternative selection process is in the best interests of the public; and

   d. Issue a written final determination to all interested parties. The final determination shall state the reasons the alternative selection process is determined to be in the best interests of the public and shall reasonably address the comments received regarding the criteria and weights for each criterion. Any modifications to the criteria, weights, and protest procedures based on comments received during the public hearing process must be included in the final determination. All protests of the decision to use the alternative selection process must be in writing and submitted to the public body within seven calendar days of the final determination. The public body shall not proceed with the selection process until after responding in writing to the protest.

2. Contracts for the services of a subcontractor under this section must be awarded through a competitive process requiring a public solicitation of proposals. Notice of the public solicitation of proposals must be provided to the office of minority and women's business enterprises. The public solicitation of proposals must include:

   a. A description of the project, including programmatic, performance, and technical requirements and specifications when available, along with a description of the project's unique aspects, complexities, and challenges;

   b. The reasons for using the alternative selection process;

   c. A description of the minimum qualifications required of the firm;

   d. A description of the process used to evaluate qualifications and proposals, including evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors;

   e. Protest procedures;

   f. The form of the contract, including any contract for preconstruction services, to be awarded;

   g. The estimated maximum allowable subcontract cost; and

   h. The bid instructions to be used by the finalists.

3. Evaluation factors for selection of the subcontractor must include, but not be limited to:

   a. Ability of the firm's professional personnel to deliver projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;

   b. The firm's past performance on projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;

   c. The firm's ability to meet time and budget requirements on projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;

   d. The scope of work the firm proposes to perform with its own forces and its ability to perform that work;

   e. The firm's plan for inclusion of disadvantaged business enterprises, to the extent permitted by law;

   f. The firm's proximity to the project location;

   g. The firm's approach to executing the project based on its delivery of other projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;

   h. The firm's approach to safety on the project;

   i. The firm's safety history;

   j. If interviews are part of the selection process, the solicitation shall describe how interviews will be scored or evaluated, and evaluations shall be included in the written selection summary; and

   k. If the firm is selected as one of the most qualified finalists, the firm's fee and cost proposal.

4. The general contractor/construction manager shall establish a committee to evaluate the proposals. At least one representative from the public body shall serve on the committee. Final proposals, including sealed bids for the percent fee on the estimated maximum allowable subcontract cost, and the fixed amount for the subcontract general conditions work specified in the request for proposal, will be requested from the most qualified firms.

5. The general contractor/construction manager must notify all proposers of the most qualified firms that will move to the next phase of the selection process. The process may not proceed to the next phase until two business days after all proposers are notified of the committee's selection decision. At the request of a proposer, the general contractor/construction manager must provide the requesting proposer with a scoring summary of the evaluation factors for its proposal. Proposers filing a protest on the selection of the most qualified finalists must file the protest with the public body in accordance with the published protest procedures. The selection process may not advance to the next phase of selection until two business days after the final protest decision issued by the public body is transmitted to the protestor.

6. The general contractor/construction manager and the public body shall select the firm submitting the highest scored final proposal using the evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors identified in the solicitation of proposals. Scoring of the nonprice factors shall be added to the scoring of the fee and cost proposals to determine the highest scored firm. The scoring of the nonprice factors must be made available at the public opening of the fee and cost proposals. The general contractor/construction manager shall notify all proposers of the selection decision and make a selection summary of the final proposals, which shall be available to all proposers within two business days of such notification. The general contractor/construction manager may not evaluate or disqualify a proposal based on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.

7. If the public body receives a timely written protest from a "most qualified firm," the general contractor/construction manager may not execute a contract for the protested subcontract work until two business days after the final protest decision issued by the public body is transmitted to the protestor. The protestor must submit its protest in accordance with the published protest procedures.

8. If the general contractor/construction manager is unable to negotiate a satisfactory maximum allowable subcontract cost with the firm selected deemed by public body and the general contractor/construction manager to be fair, reasonable, and within the available funds, negotiations with that firm must be formally terminated and the general contractor/construction manager may negotiate with the next highest scored firm until an agreement is reached or the process is terminated.

9. With the approval of the public body, the general contractor/construction manager may contract with the selected firm to provide preconstruction services during the design phase that may include life-cycle cost design considerations, value engineering, scheduling, cost estimating, constructability, alternative construction options for cost savings, and sequencing of work; and to act as the subcontractor during the construction phase.

10. The maximum allowable subcontract cost must be used to establish a total subcontract cost for purposes of a performance and payment bond. Total subcontract cost means the fixed amount for the detailed specified general conditions work, the negotiated maximum allowable subcontract cost, and the percent fee on the negotiated maximum allowable subcontract cost. Maximum allowable subcontract cost means the maximum cost to complete the work specified for the subcontract, including the estimated cost of work to be performed by the subcontractor's own forces, a percentage for risk contingency, negotiated support services, and approved change orders. The maximum allowable subcontract cost must be negotiated between the general contractor/construction manager and the selected firm when the construction documents and specifications are at least ninety percent complete. Final agreement on the maximum allowable subcontract cost is subject to the approval of the public body.

11. If the work of the subcontractor is completed for less than the maximum allowable subcontract cost, any savings not otherwise negotiated as part of an incentive clause becomes part of the risk contingency included in the general contractor/construction manager's maximum allowable construction cost. If the work of the subcontractor is completed for more than the maximum allowable subcontract cost, the additional cost is the responsibility of that subcontractor. An independent audit, paid for by the public body, must be conducted to confirm the proper accrual of costs. The public body or general contractor/construction manager shall define the scope of the audit in the contract.

12. A subcontractor selected under this section may perform work with its own forces. In the event it elects to subcontract some of its work, it must select a subcontractor utilizing the procedure outlined in RCW 39.10.380.

## 39.10.430 - Job order procedure—Contract award process.
1. Job order contracts shall be awarded through a competitive process using public requests for proposals.

2. The public body shall prioritize efforts to solicit proposals from certified minority or certified woman-owned contractors to the extent permitted by the Washington state civil rights act, RCW 49.60.400.

3. The public body shall publish, at least once in a statewide publication and legal newspaper of general circulation published in every county in which the public works project is anticipated, a request for proposals for job order contracts and the availability and location of the request for proposal documents. The public body is encouraged to post the request for proposals for job order contracts and the availability and location of the request for proposal documents in other areas, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize the opportunities. The public body shall ensure that the request for proposal documents at a minimum includes:

   a. A detailed description of the scope of the job order contract including performance, technical requirements and specifications, functional and operational elements, minimum and maximum work order amounts, duration of the contract, and options to extend the job order contract;

   b. The reasons for using job order contracts;

   c. A description of the qualifications required of the proposer;

   d. The identity of the specific unit price book to be used and a description of which elements shall be included in the coefficient as necessary to establish a firm fixed price on work orders to be awarded under the job order contract;

   e. The minimum contracted amount committed to the selected job order contractor;

   f. A description of the process the public body will use to evaluate qualifications and proposals, including evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors. The public body shall ensure that evaluation factors include, but are not limited to, the coefficient and the ability of the proposer to perform the job order contract. In evaluating the ability of the proposer to perform the job order contract, the public body may consider: The ability of the professional personnel who will work on the job order contract; past performance on similar contracts; ability to meet time and budget requirements; past performance on approved subcontractor inclusion plans; ability to provide a performance and payment bond for the job order contract; recent, current, and projected workloads of the proposer; location; and the concept of the proposal;

   g. The form of the contract to be awarded;

   h. The method for pricing renewals of or extensions to the job order contract;

   i. A notice that the proposals are subject to RCW 39.10.470; and

   j. Other relevant information.

4. A public body shall establish a committee, including a member with knowledge and experience in state and federal laws, rules, and best practices concerning public contracting for minority, women, and veteran-owned businesses and small businesses, to evaluate the proposals. After the committee has selected the most qualified finalists, the finalists shall submit a sealed bid including, but not limited to, coefficient(s). Such bids may be in the form of coefficient adjustments to the listed unit price book. The public body shall award the contract to the firm submitting the highest scored final proposal using the evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors published in the public request for proposals and will notify the board of the award of the contract.

5. The public body shall provide a protest period of at least ten business days following the day of the announcement of the apparent successful proposal to allow a protester to file a detailed statement of the grounds of the protest. The public body shall promptly make a determination on the merits of the protest and provide to all proposers a written decision of denial or acceptance of the protest. The public body shall not execute the contract until two business days following the public body's decision on the protest.

6. The requirements of RCW 39.30.060 do not apply to requests for proposals for job order contracts.

## 39.10.440 - Job order procedure—Contract requirements.
1. The maximum total dollar amount that may be awarded under a job order contract is $4,000,000 per year for a maximum of three years. Any unused capacity from the previous year may be carried over for one year and added to the immediate following year's limit. The maximum annual volume including unused capacity shall not exceed the limit of two years. The maximum total dollar amount that may be awarded under a job order contract for the department of enterprise services, counties with a population of more than 1,000,000, and cities with a population of more than 400,000 is $6,000,000 per year for a maximum of three years. The maximum total dollar amounts are exclusive of Washington state sales and use tax.

2. Job order contracts may be executed for an initial contract term of not to exceed two years, with the option of extending or renewing the job order contract for one year. All extensions or renewals must be priced as provided in the request for proposals. The extension or renewal must be mutually agreed to by the public body and the job order contractor.

3. A public body may have no more than three job order contracts in effect at any one time, with the exception of the department of enterprise services, which may have six job order contracts in effect at any one time.

4. At least 90 percent of work contained in a job order contract must be subcontracted to entities other than the job order contractor. The job order contractor must distribute contracts as equitably as possible among qualified and available subcontractors including certified minority and woman-owned subcontractors to the extent permitted by law as demonstrated on the subcontractor and supplier project submission, and shall limit subcontractor bonding requirements to the greatest extent possible.

5. The job order contractor shall publish notification of intent to perform public works projects at the beginning of each contract year in a statewide publication and in a legal newspaper of general circulation in every county in which the public works projects are anticipated. The job order contractor is encouraged to post the notification of intent to perform public works projects in other areas, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize subcontractor opportunities.

6. Job order contractors shall pay prevailing wages for all work that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of chapter 39.12 RCW. Prevailing wages for all work performed pursuant to each work order must be the rates in effect at the time the individual work order is issued.

7. If, in the initial contract term, the public body, at no fault of the job order contractor, fails to issue the minimum amount of work orders stated in the public request for proposals, the public body shall pay the contractor an amount equal to the difference between the minimum work order amount and the actual total of the work orders issued multiplied by an appropriate percentage for overhead and profit contained in the contract award coefficient for services as specified in the request for proposals. This is the contractor's sole remedy.

8. All job order contracts awarded under this section must be signed before July 1, 2031; however the job order contract may be extended or renewed as provided for in this section.

## 39.10.450 - Job order procedure—Work orders.
1. The maximum dollar amount for a work order is five hundred thousand dollars, excluding Washington state sales and use tax.

2. All work orders issued for the same project shall be treated as a single work order for purposes of the dollar limit on work orders.

3. No more than twenty percent of the dollar value of a work order may consist of items of work not contained in the unit price book.

4. Any new stand-alone permanent structure constructed under a work order shall not exceed three thousand gross square feet.

5. A public body may issue no work orders under a job order contract until it has approved, in consultation with the office of minority and women's business enterprises or the equivalent local agency, a plan prepared by the job order contractor that equitably spreads certified women and minority business enterprise subcontracting opportunities, to the extent permitted by the Washington state civil rights act, RCW 49.60.400, among the various subcontract disciplines.

6. For purposes of chapters 39.08, 39.12, 39.76, and 60.28 RCW, each work order issued shall be treated as a separate contract. The alternate filing provisions of RCW 39.12.040(2) apply to each work order that otherwise meets the eligibility requirements of RCW 39.12.040(2).

7. The job order contract shall not be used for the procurement of architectural or engineering services not associated with specific work orders. Architectural and engineering services shall be procured in accordance with RCW 39.80.040.

8. Any work order over three hundred fifty thousand dollars, excluding Washington state sales and use tax, and including over six hundred single trade hours shall utilize a state registered apprenticeship program for that single trade in accordance with RCW 39.04.320. Awarding entities may adjust this requirement for a specific work order for the following reasons:

   a. The demonstrated lack of availability of apprentices in specific geographic areas;

   b. A disproportionately high ratio of material costs to labor hours, which does not make feasible the required minimum levels of apprentice participation;

   c. Participating contractors have demonstrated a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of RCW 39.04.300 and 39.04.310; or

   d. Other criteria the awarding entity deems appropriate.
