2. The state finance committee may authorize the state treasurer, by resolution[,] to:

   a. Accept offers to purchase the bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness and to sell and deliver the bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness to the purchases thereof;

   b. Determine the date or dates, price or prices, principal amounts per maturity, delivery dates, interest rate or rates (or mechanisms for determining the interest rate or rates); and

4. The state finance committee may issue, under chapter 39.53 RCW and this chapter, bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness to refund at or prior to maturity any outstanding state bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness.
