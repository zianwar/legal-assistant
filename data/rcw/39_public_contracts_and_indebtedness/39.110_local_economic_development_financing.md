## 39.110.005 - Findings—Purpose.
1. The legislature finds that the issuance of taxable nonrecourse revenue bonds by the Washington economic development finance authority has provided a number of Washington firms with the financing necessary to grow and create jobs. The legislature further finds that municipal authority to issue taxable nonrecourse revenue bonds does not exist and that authorizing the local issuance of taxable bonds for economic development purposes will increase local capacity to strengthen businesses and create jobs.

2. It is the purpose of this chapter to grant new authority for cities, counties, and port districts that created public corporations under chapter 39.84 RCW prior to 2012, in order to build on the expertise with tax-exempt nonrecourse revenue bond financing developed by these municipalities. Therefore, these municipalities are permitted to create local economic development finance authorities to act as a financial conduit that, without using state or local government funds or lending the credit of the state or local governments, can issue taxable and nontaxable nonrecourse revenue bonds, and participate in federal, state, and local economic development programs to help facilitate access to needed capital by Washington businesses. It is also a primary purpose of this chapter to encourage the development of local innovative approaches to the problem of unmet capital needs. This chapter must be construed liberally to carry out its purposes and objectives.

## 39.110.020 - Economic development finance authority—Creation—Dissolution—Requirements—Penalty.
1. A municipality that formed a public corporation under chapter 39.84 RCW prior to January 1, 2012, may, if that public corporation is still in existence, enact an ordinance creating an economic development finance authority for the purposes authorized in this chapter. The ordinance creating the authority must approve a charter for the authority containing such provisions as are authorized by and not in conflict with this chapter. Any charter issued under this chapter must contain in substance the limitations set forth in RCW 39.110.030. In any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority is conclusively presumed to be established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers under this chapter upon proof of the adoption of the ordinance creating the authority by the governing body. A copy of the ordinance duly certified by the clerk of the governing body of the municipality is admissible in evidence in any suit, action, or proceeding.

2. An authority created by a municipality pursuant to this chapter may be dissolved by the municipality if: (a) The authority has no property to administer, other than funds or property, if any, to be paid or transferred to the municipality by which it was established; and (b) all the authority's outstanding obligations have been satisfied. Such a dissolution must be accomplished by the governing body of the municipality adopting an ordinance providing for the dissolution.

3. The creating municipality may, at its discretion and at any time, alter or change the structure, organizational programs, or activities of an authority, including termination of the authority if contracts entered into by the authority are not impaired. Any net earnings of an authority, beyond those necessary for retirement of indebtedness incurred by it, do not inure to the benefit of any person other than the creating municipality. Upon dissolution of an authority, title to all property owned by the authority vests in the municipality.

4. The ordinance creating an authority must include provisions establishing a board of directors to govern the affairs of the authority, what constitutes a quorum of the board of directors, and how the authority must conduct its affairs. 

5. For a period of ten years after any financing through an authority, it is illegal for a director, officer, agent, or employee of an authority to have, directly or indirectly, any financial interest in any property to be included in or any contract for property, services, or materials to be furnished or used in connection with any economic development activity financed through the authority. Violation of any provision of this section is a gross misdemeanor.

6. The finances of any authority are subject to examination by the state auditor's office pursuant to RCW 43.09.260.

\[ [2012 c 193 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6140-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2012%20c%20193%20§%203); \]

## 39.110.030 - Lending to authority—Issuance of revenue obligations—Delegation of authority.
1. No municipality may give or lend any money or property in aid of an authority. The municipality that creates an authority must annually review any financial statements of the authority and at all times must have access to the books and records of the authority. No authority may issue revenue obligations under this chapter except upon the approval of both the municipality under the auspices of which it was created and the county, city, or town within whose planning jurisdiction the economic development activity to be financed lies. Upon receiving approval from these jurisdictions, an authority must, before bonds may be issued, obtain one of the following:

   a. A letter of credit supporting the creditworthiness of the borrower from a bank with an investment grade credit rating;

   b. Confirmation that the borrower has arranged for private placement of the bonds with an institutional investor; or

   c. Confirmation that the borrower has an investment grade credit rating of their own.

2. An authority established under the terms of this chapter constitutes an authority and an instrumentality (within the meaning of those terms in the regulations of the United States treasury and the rulings of the internal revenue service prescribed pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 103 of the federal internal revenue code of 1986, as amended) may act on behalf of the municipality under whose auspices it is created for the specific public purposes authorized by this chapter. The authority is not a municipal corporation within the meaning of the state Constitution and the laws of the state, or a political subdivision within the meaning of the state Constitution and the laws of the state, including without limitation, Article VIII, section 7 of the Washington state Constitution. A municipality may not delegate to an authority any of the municipality's attributes of sovereignty including, without limitation, the power to tax, the power of eminent domain, and the police power.

\[ [2012 c 193 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6140-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2012%20c%20193%20§%204); \]

2. An authority is authorized to participate fully in federal and other governmental economic development finance programs and to take such actions as are necessary and consistent with this chapter to secure the benefits of those programs and to meet their requirements.

3. An authority may develop and conduct a program that will stimulate and encourage the development of new products within Washington state by the infusion of financial aid for invention and innovation in situations in which the financial aid would not otherwise be reasonably available from commercial sources. The authority is authorized to provide nonrecourse revenue bond financing for this program.

   a. For the purposes of this program, the authority has the following powers and duties:

      i. To enter into financing agreements with eligible persons doing business in Washington state, upon terms and on conditions consistent with the purposes of this chapter, for the advancement of financial and other assistance to the persons for the development of specific products, procedures, and techniques, to be developed and produced in this state, and to condition the agreements upon contractual assurances that the benefits of increasing or maintaining employment and tax revenues remain in this state and accrue to it;

      ii. Own, possess, and take license in patents, copyrights, and proprietary processes and negotiate and enter into contracts and establish charges for the use of the patents, copyrights, and proprietary processes when the patents and licenses for products result from assistance provided by the authority;

      iii. Negotiate royalty payments to the authority on patents and licenses for products arising as a result of assistance provided by the authority;

      iv. Negotiate and enter into other types of contracts with eligible persons that assure that public benefits will result from the provision of services by the authority; provided that the contracts are consistent with the state Constitution;

      v. Encourage and provide technical assistance to eligible persons in the process of developing new products;

      vi. Refer eligible persons to researchers or laboratories for the purpose of testing and evaluating new products, processes, or innovations; and

   b. Eligible persons seeking financial and other assistance under this program must forward an application, together with an application fee prescribed by rule, to the authority. An investigation and report concerning the advisability of approving an application for assistance must be completed by the staff of the authority. The investigation and report may include, but is not limited to, facts about the company under consideration as its history, wage standards, job opportunities, stability of employment, past and present financial condition and structure, pro forma income statements, present and future markets and prospects, integrity of management as well as the feasibility of the proposed product and invention to be granted financial assistance, including the state of development of the product as well as the likelihood of its commercial feasibility. After receipt and consideration of the report set out in this subsection and after other action as is deemed appropriate, the application must be approved or denied by the authority. The applicant must be promptly notified of action by the authority.

4. An authority may receive no appropriation of state funds. The department of commerce and the Washington economic development finance authority may assist a local economic development finance authority in organizing itself and in designing programs.

5. An authority may use any funds legally available to it for any purpose specifically authorized by this chapter, or for otherwise improving economic development by assisting businesses and farm enterprises that do not have access to capital at terms and rates comparable to large corporations due to the location of the business, the size of the business, the lack of financial expertise, or other appropriate reasons.

6. An authority must coordinate its activities with those, including bond issuance activities, of the creating municipality and the public corporation created under chapter 39.84 RCW by the creating municipality.

## 39.110.090 - Bonds—Payment source—Disclosures—Proceeds not public money—Contracting.
1. Bonds issued by an authority established under this chapter are not considered to constitute a debt of the state, of the municipality, or of any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of this state or to pledge any or all of the faith and credit of any of these entities. The revenue bonds are payable solely from both the revenues derived as a result of the economic development activities funded by the revenue bonds including, without limitation, amounts received under the terms of any financing document or by reason of any additional security furnished by beneficiaries of the economic development activity in connection with the financing thereof, and money and other property received from private sources.

Each revenue bond must contain on its face, and any disclosure document prepared in conjunction with the offer and sale of bonds must include, statements to the effect that:

   a. Neither the state, the municipality, or any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of the state is obligated to pay the principal or the interest thereon;

   b. No tax funds or governmental revenue may be used to pay the principal or interest thereon; and

   c. Neither any or all of the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state, the municipality, or any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the revenue bond.

2. Neither the proceeds of bonds issued under this chapter nor any money used or to be used to pay the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the bonds constitute public money or property. All of such money must be kept segregated and set apart from funds of the state and any political subdivision of the state and are not subject to appropriation or allotment by the state or subject to the provisions of chapter 43.88 RCW.

3. Contracts entered into by an authority must be entered into in the name of the authority and not in the name of the state or any political subdivision of the state. The obligations of the authority under such contracts are obligations only of the authority and are not, in any way, obligations of the municipality creating the authority or the state. An authority may incur only those financial obligations which will be paid from revenues received pursuant to financing documents, from fees or charges paid by beneficiaries of the economic development activities funded by the revenue bonds, or from the proceeds of revenue bonds.
