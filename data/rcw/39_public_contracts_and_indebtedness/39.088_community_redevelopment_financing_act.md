## 39.88.010 - Declaration.
It is declared to be the public policy of the state of Washington to promote and facilitate the orderly development and economic stability of its urban areas. The provision of adequate government services and the creation of employment opportunities for the citizens within urban areas depends upon the economic growth and the strength of their tax base. The construction of necessary public improvements in accordance with local community planning will encourage investment in job-producing private development and will expand the public tax base.

It is the purpose of this chapter to allocate a portion of regular property taxes for limited periods of time to assist in the financing of public improvements which are needed to encourage private development of urban areas; to prevent or arrest the decay of urban areas due to the inability of existing financing methods to provide needed public improvements; to encourage local taxing districts to cooperate in the allocation of future tax revenues arising in urban areas in order to facilitate the long-term growth of their common tax base; and to encourage private investment within urban areas.

2. At least fifteen days in advance of the hearing:

   a. Deliver notice of the hearing to all taxing districts, the county treasurer, and the county assessor, which notice includes a map or drawing showing the location of the contemplated public improvement and the boundaries of the proposed apportionment district, a brief description of the public improvement, the estimated cost thereof, the anticipated increase in property values within the apportionment district, the location of the sponsor's principal business office where it will maintain information concerning the public improvement for public inspection, and the date and place of hearing; and

## 39.88.060 - Disagreements between taxing districts.
1. Any taxing district that objects to the apportionment district, the duration of the apportionment, the manner of apportionment, or the propriety of cost items established by the public improvement ordinance of the sponsor may, within thirty days after mailing of the ordinance, petition for review thereof by the state board of tax appeals. The state board of tax appeals shall meet within a reasonable time, hear all the evidence presented by the parties on matters in dispute, and determine the issues upon the evidence as may be presented to it at the hearing. The board may approve or deny the public improvement ordinance as enacted or may grant approval conditioned upon modification of the ordinance by the sponsor. The decision by the state board of tax appeals shall be final and conclusive but shall not preclude modification or discontinuation of the public improvement.

2.

## 39.88.070 - Apportionment of taxes.
1. Upon the date established in the public improvement ordinance, but not sooner than the first day of the calendar year following the passage of the ordinance, the regular property taxes levied upon the assessed value of real property within the apportionment district shall be divided as follows:

   a. That portion of the regular property taxes produced by the rate of tax levied each year by or for each of the taxing districts upon the tax allocation base value of real property, or upon the assessed value of real property in each year, whichever is smaller, shall be allocated to and paid to the respective taxing districts; and

   b. That portion of the regular property taxes levied each year by or for each of the taxing districts upon the assessed value of real property within an apportionment district which is in excess of the tax allocation base value of real property shall be allocated and paid to the sponsor, or the sponsor's designated agent, until all public improvement costs to be paid from the tax allocation revenues have been paid, except that the sponsor may agree to receive less than the full amount of such portion as long as bond debt service, reserve, and other bond covenant requirements are satisfied, in which case the balance of the taxes shall be allocated to the respective taxing districts as the sponsor and the taxing districts may agree.

2. The county assessor shall revalue the real property within the apportionment district for the purpose of determining the tax allocation base value for the apportionment district and shall certify to the sponsor the tax allocation base value as soon as practicable after the assessor receives notice of the public improvement ordinance and shall certify to the sponsor the total assessed value of real property within thirty days after the property values for each succeeding year have been established, except that the assessed value of state-assessed real property within the apportionment district shall be certified as soon as the values are provided to the assessor by the department of revenue. Nothing in this section authorizes revaluations of real property by the assessor for property taxation that are not made in accordance with the assessor's revaluation plan under chapter 84.41 RCW.

3. The date upon which the apportionment district was established shall be considered the date upon which the public improvement ordinance was enacted by the sponsor.

4. The apportionment of regular property taxes under this section shall cease when tax allocation revenues are no longer necessary or obligated to pay public improvement costs or to pay principal of and interest on bonds issued to finance public improvement costs and payable in whole or in part from tax allocation revenues. At the time of termination of the apportionment, any excess money and any earnings thereon held by the sponsor shall be returned to the county treasurer and distributed to the taxing districts which were subject to the allocation in proportion to their regular property tax levies due for the year in which the funds are returned.

\[ [1982 1st ex.s. c 42 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c42.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2042%20§%208); \]
