## 39.102.010 - Finding. (Expires June 30, 2044.)
The legislature recognizes that the state as a whole benefits from investment in public infrastructure because it promotes community and economic development. Public investment stimulates business activity and helps create jobs; stimulates the redevelopment of brownfields and blighted areas in the inner city; lowers the cost of housing; and promotes efficient land use. The legislature finds that these activities generate revenue for the state and that it is in the public interest to invest in these projects through a credit against the state sales and use tax and an allocation of property tax revenue to those sponsoring local governments that can demonstrate the expected returns to the state.

5. The distribution of local property tax allocation revenues pursuant to this section shall not affect or be deemed to affect the rate of taxes levied by or within any sponsoring local government and participating taxing district or the consistency of any such levies with the uniformity requirement of Article VII, section 1 of the state Constitution.

## 39.102.190 - Revenue bonds to fund public improvements. (Expires June 30, 2044.)
1. A sponsoring local government may issue revenue bonds to fund revenue-generating public improvements, or portions of public improvements, that are located within a revenue development area. Whenever revenue bonds are to be issued, the legislative authority of the sponsoring local government shall create or have created a special fund or funds from which, along with any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140, the principal and interest on these revenue bonds shall exclusively be payable. The legislative authority of the sponsoring local government may obligate the sponsoring local government to set aside and pay into the special fund or funds a fixed proportion or a fixed amount of the revenues from the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds. This amount or proportion is a lien and charge against these revenues, subject only to operating and maintenance expenses. The sponsoring local government shall have due regard for the cost of operation and maintenance of the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds, and shall not set aside into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues that in its judgment will be available over and above the cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenue previously pledged. The sponsoring local government may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source or sources of revenue may later be issued on a parity with any revenue bonds being issued and sold.

2. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section are not an indebtedness of the sponsoring local government issuing the bonds, and the interest and principal on the bonds shall only be payable from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The owner or bearer of a revenue bond or any interest coupon issued pursuant to this section shall not have any claim against the sponsoring local government arising from the bond or coupon except for payment from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The substance of the limitations included in this subsection shall be plainly printed, written, or engraved on each bond issued pursuant to this section.

3. Revenue bonds with a maturity in excess of twenty-five years shall not be issued. The legislative authority of the sponsoring local government shall by resolution determine for each revenue bond issue the amount, date, form, terms, conditions, denominations, maximum fixed or variable interest rate or rates, maturity or maturities, redemption rights, registration privileges, manner of execution, manner of sale, callable provisions, if any, and covenants including the refunding of existing revenue bonds. Facsimile signatures may be used on the bonds and any coupons. Refunding revenue bonds may be issued in the same manner as revenue bonds are issued.

4. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (3) of this section, bonds issued under this section may be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.

## 39.102.195 - Limitation on use of revenues. (Expires June 30, 2044.)
To the extent that amounts received as local excise tax allocation revenues, local property tax allocation revenues, other revenues from local public sources, that are dedicated to local infrastructure financing, and revenues received from the local option sales and use tax authorized in RCW 82.14.475, are set aside in a debt service fund that is pledged to the repayment of bonds, those amounts so set aside and pledged may not be used to pay for public improvement costs on a pay-as-you-go basis after the date that the sponsoring local government that issued the bonds as provided in RCW 39.102.150 is required to begin paying debt service on those bonds, unless and until those bonds to which the amounts have been so pledged have been retired.
