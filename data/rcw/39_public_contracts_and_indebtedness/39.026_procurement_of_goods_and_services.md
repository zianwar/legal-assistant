## 39.26.005 - Intent.
It is the intent of this chapter to promote open competition and transparency for all contracts for goods and services entered into by state agencies, unless specifically exempted under this chapter. It is further the intent of this chapter to centralize within one agency the authority and responsibility for the development and oversight of policies related to state procurement and contracting. To ensure the highest ethical standards, proper accounting for contract expenditures, and for ease of public review, it is further the intent to centralize the location of information about state procurements and contracts. It is also the intent of the legislature to provide state agency contract data to the public in a searchable manner.

In addition, the legislature intends that the state develop procurement policies, procedures, and materials that encourage and facilitate state agency purchase of goods and services from Washington small businesses.

The director shall have broad discretionary power in developing these rules and the rules shall provide for reciprocity only to the extent and in those instances where the director considers it appropriate. For the purpose of determining the lowest responsible bidder pursuant to RCW 39.26.160, such rules shall (1) require the director to impose a reciprocity increase on bids when appropriate under the rules and (2) establish methods for determining the amount of the increase. In no instance shall such increase, if any, be paid to a vendor whose bid is accepted.
