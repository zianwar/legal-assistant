## 39.35C.040 - Sale of conserved energy.
1. It is the intent of this chapter that the state, state agencies, and school districts are compensated fairly for the energy savings provided to utilities and be allowed to participate on an equal basis in any utility conservation program, bidding, or solicitation process. State agencies and school districts shall not receive preferential treatment. For the purposes of this section, any type of compensation from a utility or the Bonneville power administration intended to achieve reductions or efficiencies in energy use which are cost-effective to the utility or the Bonneville power administration shall be regarded as a sale of energy savings. Such compensation may include credits to the energy bill, low or no interest loans, rebates, or payment per unit of energy saved. The department shall, in coordination with utilities, the Bonneville power administration, state agencies, and school districts, facilitate the sale of energy savings at public facilities including participation in any competitive bidding or solicitation which has been agreed to by the state agency or school district. Energy savings may only be sold to local utilities or, under conditions specified in this section, to the Bonneville power administration. The department shall not attempt to sell energy savings occurring in one utility service territory to a different utility. Nothing in this chapter mandates that utilities purchase the energy savings.

2. To ensure an equitable allocation of benefits to the state, state agencies, and school districts, the following conditions shall apply to transactions between utilities or the Bonneville power administration and state agencies or school districts for sales of energy savings:

   a. A transaction shall be approved by both the state agency or school district and the department.

   b. The state agency or school district and the department shall work together throughout the planning and negotiation process for such transactions unless the department determines that its participation will not further the purposes of this section.

   c. Before making a decision under (d) of this subsection, the department shall review the proposed transaction for its technical and economic feasibility, the adequacy and reasonableness of procedures proposed for verification of project or program performance, the degree of certainty of benefits to the state, state agency, or school district, the degree of risk assumed by the state or school district, the benefits offered to the state, state agency, or school district and such other factors as the department determines to be prudent.

   d. The department shall approve a transaction unless it finds, pursuant to the review in (c) of this subsection, that the transaction would not result in an equitable allocation of costs and benefits to the state, state agency, or school district, in which case the transaction shall be disapproved.

   e. In addition to the requirements of (c) and (d) of this subsection, in areas in which the Bonneville power administration has a program for the purchase of energy savings at public facilities, the department shall approve the transaction unless the local utility cannot offer a benefit substantially equivalent to that offered by the Bonneville power administration, in which case the transaction shall be disapproved. In determining whether the local utility can offer a substantially equivalent benefit, the department shall consider the net present value of the payment for energy savings; any goods, services, or financial assistance provided by the local utility; and any risks borne by the local utility. Any direct negative financial impact on a nongrowing, local utility shall be considered.

3. Any party to a potential transaction may, within thirty days of any decision to disapprove a transaction made pursuant to subsection (2)(c), (d), or (e) of this section, request an independent reviewer who is mutually agreeable to all parties to the transaction to review the decision. The parties shall within thirty days of selection submit to the independent reviewer documentation supporting their positions. The independent reviewer shall render advice regarding the validity of the disapproval within an additional thirty days.

## 39.35C.070 - Development of cogeneration projects.
1. Consistent with the region's need to develop cost-effective, high-efficiency electric energy resources, the state shall investigate and, if appropriate, pursue development of cost-effective opportunities for cogeneration in existing or new state facilities.

2. To assist state agencies in identifying, evaluating, and developing potential cogeneration projects at their facilities, the department shall notify state agencies of their responsibilities under this chapter; apprise them of opportunities to develop and finance such projects; and provide technical and analytical support. The department shall recover costs for such assistance through written agreements, including reimbursement from third parties participating in such projects, for any costs and expenses incurred in providing such assistance.

3. [Empty]

   a. The department shall identify priorities for cogeneration projects at state facilities, and, where such projects are initially deemed desirable by the department and the appropriate state agency, the department shall notify the local utility serving the state facility of its intent to conduct a feasibility study at such facility. The department shall consult with the local utility and provide the local utility an opportunity to participate in the development of the feasibility study for the state facility it serves.

   b. If the local utility has an interest in participating in the feasibility study, it shall notify the department and the state agency whose facility or facilities it serves within sixty days of receipt of notification pursuant to (a) of this subsection as to the nature and scope of its desired participation. The department, state agency, and local utility shall negotiate the responsibilities, if any, of each in conducting the feasibility study, and these responsibilities shall be specified in a written agreement.

   c. If a local utility identifies a potential cogeneration project at a state facility for which it intends to conduct a feasibility study, it shall notify the department and the appropriate state agency. The department, state agency, and local utility shall negotiate the responsibilities, if any, of each in conducting the feasibility study, and these responsibilities shall be specified in a written agreement. Nothing in this section shall preclude a local utility from conducting an independent assessment of a potential cogeneration project at a state facility.

   d. Agreements written pursuant to (a) and (b) of this subsection shall include a provision for the recovery of costs incurred by a local utility in performing a feasibility study in the event such utility does not participate in the development of the cogeneration project. If the local utility does participate in the cogeneration project through energy purchase, project development or ownership, recovery of the utility's costs may be deferred or provided for through negotiation on agreements for energy purchase, project development or ownership.

   e. If the local utility declines participation in the feasibility study, the department and the state agency may receive and solicit proposals to conduct the feasibility study from other parties. Participation of these other parties shall also be secured and defined by a written agreement which may include the provision for reimbursement of costs incurred in the formulation of the feasibility study.

4. The feasibility study shall include consideration of regional and local utility needs for power, the consistency of the proposed cogeneration project with the state energy strategy, the cost and certainty of fuel supplies, the value of electricity produced, the capability of the state agency to own and/or operate such facilities, the capability of utilities or third parties to own and/or operate such facilities, requirements for and costs of standby sources of power, costs associated with interconnection with the local electric utility's transmission system, the capability of the local electric utility to wheel electricity generated by the facility, costs associated with obtaining wheeling services, potential financial risks and losses to the state and/or state agency, measures to mitigate the financial risk to the state and/or state agency, and benefits to the state and to the state agency from a range of design configurations, ownership, and operation options.

5. Based upon the findings of the feasibility study, the department and the state agency shall determine whether a cogeneration project will be cost-effective and whether development of a cogeneration project should be pursued. This determination shall be made in consultation with the local utility or, if the local utility had not participated in the development of the feasibility study, with any third party that may have participated in the development of the feasibility study.

   a. Recognizing the local utility's expertise, knowledge, and ownership and operation of the local utility systems, the department and the state agency shall have the authority to negotiate directly with the local utility for the purpose of entering into a sole source contract to develop, own, and/or operate the cogeneration facility. The contract may also include provisions for the purchase of electricity or thermal energy from the cogeneration facility, the acquisition of a fuel source, and any financial considerations which may accrue to the state from ownership and/or operation of the cogeneration facility by the local utility.

   b. The department may enter into contracts through competitive negotiation under this subsection for the development, ownership, and/or operation of a cogeneration facility. In determining an acceptable bid, the department and the state agency may consider such factors as technical knowledge, experience, management, staff, or schedule, as may be necessary to achieve economical construction or operation of the project. The selection of a developer or operator of a cogeneration facility shall be made in accordance with procedures for competitive bidding under chapter 43.19 RCW.

   c. The department shall comply with the requirements of chapter 39.80 RCW when contracting for architectural or engineering services.

6. [Empty]

   a. The state may own and/or operate a cogeneration project at a state facility. However, unless the cogeneration project is determined to be cost-effective, based on the findings of the feasibility study, the department and state agency shall not pursue development of the project as a state-owned facility. If the project is found to be cost-effective, and the department and the state agency agree development of the cogeneration project should be pursued as a state-owned and/or operated facility, the department shall assist the state agency in the preparation of a finance and development plan for the cogeneration project. Any such plan shall fully account for and specify all costs to the state for developing and/or operating the cogeneration facility.

   b. It is the general intent of this chapter that cogeneration projects developed and owned by the state will be sized to the projected thermal energy load of the state facility over the useful life of the project. The principal purpose and use of such projects is to supply thermal energy to a state facility and not primarily to develop generating capacity for the sale of electricity. For state-owned projects with electricity production in excess of projected thermal requirements, the department shall seek and obtain legislative appropriation and approval for development. Nothing in chapter 201, Laws of 1991 shall be construed to authorize any state agency to sell electricity or thermal energy on a retail basis.

7. When a cogeneration facility will be developed, owned, and/or operated by a state agency or third party other than the local serving utility, the department and the state agency shall negotiate a written agreement with the local utility. Elements of such an agreement shall include provisions to ensure system safety, provisions to ensure reliability of any interconnected operations equipment necessary for parallel operation and switching equipment capable of isolating the generation facility, the provision of and reimbursement for standby services, if required, and the provision of and reimbursement for wheeling electricity, if the provision of such has been agreed to by the local utility.

8. The state may develop and own a thermal energy distribution system associated with a cogeneration project for the principal purpose of distributing thermal energy at the state facility. If thermal energy is to be sold outside the state facility, the state may only sell the thermal energy to a utility.

The state or state agency shall comply with and shall be bound by applicable avoided cost schedules, electric power wheeling charges, interconnection requirements, utility tariffs, and regulatory provisions to the same extent it would be required to comply and would be bound if it were a private citizen. The state shall neither seek regulatory advantage, nor change regulations, regulatory policy, process, or decisions to its advantage as a seller of cogenerated energy. Nothing contained in chapter 201, Laws of 1991 shall be construed to mandate or require public or private utilities to wheel electric energy resources within or beyond their service territories. Nothing in chapter 201, Laws of 1991 authorizes any state agency or school district to make any sale of energy or waste heat beyond the explicit provisions of chapter 201, Laws of 1991. Nothing contained in chapter 201, Laws of 1991 requires a utility to purchase energy from the state or a state agency or enter into any agreement in connection with a cogeneration facility.

   b. The state shall neither construct, nor be party to an agreement for developing a cogeneration project at a state facility for the purpose of supplying its own electrical needs, unless it can show that such an arrangement would be in the economic interest of the state taking into account the cost of (i) interconnection requirements, as specified by the local electric utility, (ii) standby charges, as may be required by the local electric utility, and (iii) the current price of electricity offered by the local electric utility. If the local electric utility can demonstrate that the cogeneration project may place an undue burden on the electric utility, the department or the state agency shall attempt to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement that would minimize the burden upon the ratepayers of the local electric utility.

4. Any party to an energy purchase agreement may, within thirty days of any decision made pursuant to subsection (2)(c) of this section to disapprove the agreement made pursuant to this section, request an independent reviewer who is mutually agreeable to all parties to review the decision. The parties shall within thirty days of selection submit to the independent reviewer documentation supporting their positions. The independent reviewer shall render advice regarding the validity of the disapproval within an additional thirty days.

5. For the purposes of this section, "waste heat" means the thermal energy that otherwise would be released to the environment from an industrial process, electric generation, or other process.
