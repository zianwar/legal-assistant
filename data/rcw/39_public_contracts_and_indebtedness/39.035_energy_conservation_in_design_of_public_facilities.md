## 39.35.010 - Legislative finding.
The legislature hereby finds:

1. That major publicly owned or leased facilities have a significant impact on our state's consumption of energy and emission of greenhouse gases from the buildings sector;

2. That energy conservation practices including energy management systems, combined heat and power systems, and renewable energy systems adopted for the design, construction, and utilization of such facilities will have a beneficial effect on our overall supply of energy;

3. That the beneficial effect of the electric output from combined heat and power systems includes both energy and capacity value;

4. That the cost of the energy consumed by such facilities, and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with that energy consumption, over the life of the facilities shall be considered in addition to the initial cost of constructing such facilities;

5. That the cost of energy is significant and major facility designs shall be based on the total life-cycle cost, including the initial construction cost, and the cost, over the economic life of a major facility, of the energy consumed, and of the operation and maintenance of a major facility as they affect energy consumption, including the costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption; and

6. That the use of energy systems in these facilities which utilize combined heat and power or renewable resources such as solar energy, wood or wood waste, or other nonconventional fuels, and which incorporate energy management systems, shall be considered in the design of all publicly owned or leased facilities.

## 39.35.020 - Legislative declaration.
The legislature declares that it is the public policy of this state to ensure that energy conservation practices, greenhouse gas emissions reduction practices, and renewable energy systems are employed in the design of major publicly owned or leased facilities and that the use of all-electric energy systems and at least one renewable energy or combined heat and power system is considered. To this end the legislature authorizes and directs that public agencies analyze the cost of energy consumption of each major facility and each critical governmental facility to be planned and constructed or renovated after September 8, 1975.

## 39.35.040 - Facility design to include life-cycle cost analysis.
Whenever a public agency determines that any major facility or a critical governmental facility is to be constructed or renovated, such agency shall cause to be included in the design phase of such construction or renovation a provision that requires a life-cycle cost analysis conforming with the guidelines developed in RCW 39.35.050 to be prepared for such facility. Such analysis shall be approved by the agency prior to the commencement of actual construction or renovation. A public agency may accept the facility design if the agency is satisfied that the life-cycle cost analysis provides for an efficient energy system or systems based on the economic life of the facility.

Nothing in this section prohibits the construction or renovation of major facilities or critical governmental facilities that utilize renewable energy or combined heat and power systems.
