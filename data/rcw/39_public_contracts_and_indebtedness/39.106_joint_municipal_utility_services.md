## 39.106.010 - Short title—Purpose—Intent—2011 c 258.
1. Chapter 258, Laws of 2011 shall be known as the joint municipal utility services act.

2. It is the purpose of chapter 258, Laws of 2011 to improve the ability of local government utilities to plan, finance, construct, acquire, maintain, operate, and provide facilities and utility services to the public, and to reduce costs and improve the benefits, efficiency, and quality of utility services.

3. Chapter 258, Laws of 2011 is intended to facilitate joint municipal utility services and is not intended to expand the types of services provided by local governments or their utilities. Further, nothing in chapter 258, Laws of 2011 is intended to alter the regulatory powers of cities, counties, or other local governments or state agencies that exercise such powers. Further, nothing in chapter 258, Laws of 2011 may be construed to alter the underlying authority of the units of local government that enter into agreements under chapter 258, Laws of 2011 or to diminish in any way the authority of local governments to enter into agreements under chapter 39.34 RCW or other applicable law.

## 39.106.030 - Formation of authorities—Characteristics—Substantive powers.
1. An authority may be formed by two or more members pursuant to this chapter by execution of a joint municipal utility services agreement that materially complies with the requirements of RCW 39.106.050. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 39.106.080, at the time of execution of an agreement each member must be providing the type of utility service or services that will be provided by the authority.

The agreement must be filed with the Washington state secretary of state, who must provide a certificate of filing with respect to any authority. An authority shall be deemed to have been formed as of the date of that filing. The formation and activities of an authority, and the admission or withdrawal of members, are not subject to review by any boundary review board. Any amendments to an agreement must be filed with the Washington state secretary of state, and will become effective on the date of filing.

Further, an authority may exercise the power of eminent domain only pursuant to the provisions of Washington law, in the manner and subject to the statutory limitations applicable to one or more of its Washington local government members. If all of its members are the same type of Washington governmental entity, then the statute governing the exercise of eminent domain by that type of entity shall govern.

## 39.106.050 - Elements of joint municipal utility services agreements.
A joint municipal utility services agreement that forms and governs an authority must include the elements described in this section, together with such other provisions an authority's members deem appropriate. However, the failure of an agreement to include each and every one of the elements described in this section shall not render the agreement invalid. An agreement must:

1.

3. Describe the utility services that the authority will provide;

4. Specify how the number of directors of the authority's board will be determined, and how those directors will be appointed.

5. Describe how votes of the members represented on the authority's board are to be weighted, and set forth any limitations on the exercise of powers of the authority's board, which may include, by way of example, requirements that certain decisions be made by a supermajority of members represented on an authority's board, based on the number of members and/or some other factor or factors, and that certain decisions be ratified by the legislative authorities of the members;

6. Describe how the agreement is to be amended;

12. Consistent with RCW 39.106.040(3)(b), specify under which Washington eminent domain laws any condemnations by the authority will be subject;

13. Specify how the treasurer of the authority will be appointed, which may be an officer or employee of the authority, the treasurer or chief finance officer of any Washington local government member, or the treasurer of any Washington county in which any member of the authority is located. However, if the total number of utility customers of all of the members of an authority does not exceed two thousand five hundred, the treasurer of an authority must be either the treasurer of any member or the treasurer of a county in which any member of the authority is located;

14. Specify under which Washington state statute or statutes surplus property of the authority will be disposed;

19. Specify the Washington state statute or statutes under which bonds, notes, and other obligations of the authority will be issued for the purpose of performing or providing utility services, which must be a bond issuance statute applicable to one or more of its members other than a tribal member. If all of its members are the same type of Washington governmental entity, then a Washington state statute or statutes governing the issuance of bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by that type of entity shall govern;

20. Specify under which Washington state statute or statutes any liens of an authority shall be exercised, which must be statutes applicable to the type or types of utility service for which the lien shall apply. Further, if all of its members are the same type of Washington governmental entity, then the statute or statutes governing that type of entity shall govern;

21. Include any other provisions deemed necessary and appropriate by the members.
