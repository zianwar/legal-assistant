Any charter issued under this chapter shall contain in substance the limitations set forth in RCW 39.84.060.

Such a dissolution shall be accomplished by the governing body of the municipality adopting an ordinance providing for the dissolution.

The creating municipality may, at its discretion and at any time, alter or change the structure, organizational programs, or activities of a public corporation, including termination of the public corporation if contracts entered into by the public corporation are not impaired. Any net earnings of a public corporation, beyond those necessary for retirement of indebtedness incurred by it, shall not inure to the benefit of any person other than the creating municipality. Upon dissolution of a public corporation, title to all property owned by the public corporation shall vest in the municipality.

\[ [1981 c 300 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c300.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20300%20§%205); \]

## 39.84.060 - Public corporations—Limitations.
No municipality may give or lend any money or property in aid of a public corporation. The municipality that creates a public corporation shall annually review any financial statements of the public corporation and at all times shall have access to the books and records of the public corporation. No public corporation may issue revenue obligations under this chapter except upon the approval of both the municipality under the auspices of which it was created and the county, city, or town within whose planning jurisdiction the proposed industrial development facility lies. No revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to this chapter unless the board of directors of the public corporation proposing to issue revenue bonds makes a finding that in its opinion the interest paid on the bonds will be exempt from income taxation by the federal government. Revenue bonds issued by a public corporation under this chapter shall not be considered to constitute a debt of the state, of the municipality, or of any other municipal corporation, quasi municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of this state or to pledge any or all of the faith and credit of any of these entities. The revenue bonds shall be payable solely from both the revenues derived as a result of the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds, including, without limitation, amounts received under the terms of any financing document or by reason of any additional security furnished by the user of the industrial development facility in connection with the financing thereof, and money and other property received from private sources. Each revenue bond shall contain on its face statements to the effect that: (1) Neither the state, the municipality, or any other municipal corporation, quasi municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of the state is obligated to pay the principal or the interest thereon; (2) no tax funds or governmental revenue may be used to pay the principal or interest thereon; and (3) neither any or all of the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state, the municipality, or any other municipal corporation, quasi municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the revenue bond. A public corporation may incur only those financial obligations which will be paid from revenues received pursuant to financing documents, from fees or charges paid by users or prospective users of the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds, or from the proceeds of revenue bonds. A public corporation established under the terms of this chapter constitutes an authority and an instrumentality (within the meaning of those terms in the regulations of the United States treasury and the rulings of the Internal Revenue Service prescribed pursuant to section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended) and may act on behalf of the municipality under whose auspices it is created for the specific public purposes authorized by this chapter. The public corporation is not a municipal corporation within the meaning of the state Constitution and the laws of the state, or a political subdivision within the meaning of the state Constitution and the laws of the state, including without limitation, Article VIII, section 7, of the Washington state Constitution. A municipality shall not delegate to a public corporation any of the municipality's attributes of sovereignty, including, without limitation, the power to tax, the power of eminent domain, and the police power.

## 39.84.100 - Revenue bonds—Provisions.
1. The principal of and the interest on any revenue bonds issued by a public corporation shall be payable solely from the funds provided for this payment from the revenues of the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds. Each issue of revenue bonds shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, and shall mature at such time or times as may be determined by the board of directors, and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the board of directors prior to the issuance of the revenue bonds or other revenue obligations.

2. The board of directors shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the revenue bonds and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the revenue bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest. If any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any revenue bonds or any coupons ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the revenue bonds, the signature shall for all purposes have the same effect as if he or she had remained in office until delivery. The revenue bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, as provided in RCW 39.46.030, or both as the board of directors may determine, and provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon revenue bonds as to the principal alone and also as to both principal and interest and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. A public corporation may sell revenue bonds at public or private sale for such price and bearing interest at such fixed or variable rate as may be determined by the board of directors.

3. The proceeds of the revenue bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of all or part of the project cost of or for the making of a loan in the amount of all or part of the project cost of the industrial development facility for which authorized and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the revenue bonds of any series issued with respect to the cost of any industrial development facility exceeds the cost of the industrial development facility for which issued, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the debt service fund for the revenue bonds or used to purchase revenue bonds in the open market.

4. A public corporation may issue interim notes in the manner provided for the issuance of revenue bonds to fund industrial development facilities prior to issuing other revenue bonds to fund such facilities. A public corporation may issue revenue bonds to fund industrial development facilities that are exchangeable for other revenue bonds when these other revenue bonds are executed and available for delivery.

5. The principal of and interest on any revenue bonds issued by a public corporation shall be secured by a pledge of unexpended bond proceeds and the revenues and receipts received by the public corporation from the industrial development facilities funded by the revenue bonds pursuant to financing documents. The resolution under which the revenue bonds are authorized to be issued and any financing document may contain agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance or use of the industrial development facility covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents, purchase price payments or loan payments, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues or from revenue bond proceeds, the rights and remedies available in the event of default, and other provisions relating to the security for the bonds, all as the board of directors consider advisable which are not in conflict with this chapter.

6. The governing body of the municipality under whose auspices the public corporation is created shall approve by resolution any agreement to issue revenue bonds adopted by a public corporation, which agreement and resolution shall set out the amount and purpose of the revenue bonds. Additionally, no issue of revenue bonds, including refunding bonds, may be sold and delivered by a public corporation without a resolution of the governing body of the municipality under whose auspices the public corporation is created, adopted no more than sixty days before the date of sale of the revenue bonds specifically, approving the resolution of the public corporation providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds.

7. All revenue bonds issued under this chapter and any interest coupons applicable thereto are negotiable instruments within the meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Title 62A RCW, regardless of form or character.

8. Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, such bonds and interim notes may be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.

## 39.84.110 - Revenue bonds—Refunding.
Each public corporation may provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued for an industrial development facility under this chapter, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption or maturity of the revenue bonds and, if considered advisable by the public corporation, for the additional purpose of financing improvements, extensions, or enlargements to the industrial development facility for another industrial development facility. The issuance of the revenue bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the public corporation in respect to the same shall be governed by this chapter insofar as applicable.

\[ [1981 c 300 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c300.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20300%20§%2011); \]

## 39.84.120 - Trust agreements.
Any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement between the public corporation and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement may evidence a pledge or assignment of the financing documents and lease, sale, or loan revenues to be received from a lessee or purchaser of or borrower with respect to an industrial development facility for the payment of principal of and interest and any premium on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable and may provide for creation and maintenance of reserves for these purposes. A trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, use, repair, operation, and insurance of the industrial development facility for which the bonds are authorized, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all money. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of revenue bonds or of revenues may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the corporation. A trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of private corporations. In addition, a trust agreement may contain such provisions as the public corporation considers reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders which are not in conflict with this chapter.

\[ [1981 c 300 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1981c300.pdf?cite=1981%20c%20300%20§%2012); \]

## 39.84.130 - Commingling of bond proceeds or revenues with municipal funds prohibited—Exception.
No part of the proceeds received from the sale of any revenue bonds under this chapter, of any revenues derived from any industrial development facility acquired or held under this chapter, or of any interest realized on moneys received under this chapter may be commingled by the public corporation with funds of the municipality creating the public corporation. However, those funds of the public corporation, other than proceeds received from the sale of revenue bonds, that are not otherwise encumbered for the payment of revenue bonds and are not reasonably anticipated by the board of directors to be necessary for administrative expenses of the public corporation may be transferred to the creating municipality and used for growth management, planning, or other economic development purposes.

## 39.84.140 - Subleases and assignments.
A lessee or contracting party under a sale contract or loan agreement shall not be required to be the eventual user of an industrial development facility if any sublessee or assignee assumes all of the obligations of the lessee or contracting party under the lease, sale contract, or loan agreement, but the lessee or contracting party or their successors shall remain primarily liable for all of its obligations under the lease, sale contract, or loan agreement and the use of the industrial development facility shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

## 39.84.160 - Proceedings in the event of default.
