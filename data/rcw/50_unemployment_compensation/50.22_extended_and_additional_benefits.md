3. For purposes of this section, the term "suitable work" means, with respect to any individual, any work which is within such individual's capabilities and which does not involve conditions described in RCW 50.20.110: PROVIDED, That if the individual furnishes evidence satisfactory to the employment security department that such individual's prospects for obtaining work in his or her customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, the determination of whether any work is suitable work with respect to such individual shall be made in accordance with RCW 50.20.100.

7. No provisions of this title which terminates a disqualification for voluntarily leaving employment, being discharged for misconduct, or refusing suitable employment shall apply for purposes of determining eligibility for extended compensation unless such termination is based upon employment subsequent to the date of such disqualification.

8. The provisions of subsections (1) through (7) of this section shall apply with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after March 31, 1981: PROVIDED HOWEVER, That the provisions of subsections (1) through (7) of this section shall not apply to those weeks of unemployment beginning after March 6, 1993, and before January 1, 1995.
