"Base year" with respect to each individual, shall mean either the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters or the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the first day of the individual's benefit year.

For the purposes of establishing a benefit year, the department shall initially use the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters as the base year. If a benefit year is not established using the first four of the last five calendar quarters as the base year, the department shall use the last four completed calendar quarters as the base year.

Computations using the last four completed calendar quarters shall be based on available wage items processed as of the close of business on the day preceding the date of application. The department shall promptly contact employers to request assistance in obtaining wage information for the last completed calendar quarter if it has not been reported at the time of initial application.

## 50.04.030 - Benefit year.
"Benefit year" with respect to each individual, means the fifty-two consecutive week period beginning with the first day of the calendar week in which the individual files an application for an initial determination and thereafter the fifty-two consecutive week period beginning with the first day of the calendar week in which the individual next files an application for an initial determination after the expiration of the individual's last preceding benefit year: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the foregoing limitation shall not be deemed to preclude the establishment of a new benefit year under the laws of another state pursuant to any agreement providing for the interstate combining of employment and wages and the interstate payment of benefits nor shall this limitation be deemed to preclude the commissioner from backdating an initial application at the request of the claimant either for the convenience of the department of employment security or for any other reason deemed by the commissioner to be good cause.

An individual's benefit year shall be extended to be fifty-three weeks when at the expiration of fifty-two weeks the establishment of a new benefit year would result in the use of a quarter of wages in the new base year that had been included in the individual's prior base year.

No benefit year will be established unless it is determined that the individual earned wages in "employment" in not less than six hundred eighty hours of the individual's base year: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That a benefit year cannot be established if the base year wages include wages earned prior to the establishment of a prior benefit year unless the individual worked and earned wages since the last separation from employment immediately before the application for initial determination in the previous benefit year if the applicant was an unemployed individual at the time of application, or since the initial separation in the previous benefit year if the applicant was not an unemployed individual at the time of filing an application for initial determination for the previous benefit year, of not less than six times the weekly benefit amount computed for the individual's new benefit year.

If an individual's prior benefit year was based on the last four completed calendar quarters, a new benefit year shall not be established until the new base year does not include any hours used in the establishment of the prior benefit year.

If the wages of an individual are not based upon a fixed duration of time or if the individual's wages are paid at irregular intervals or in such manner as not to extend regularly over the period of employment, the wages for any week shall be determined in such manner as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe. Such regulation shall, so far as possible, secure results reasonably similar to those which would prevail if the individual were paid his or her wages at regular intervals.

## 50.04.152 - Employment—Farm internship program. (Expires December 31, 2025.)
1. Except for services subject to RCW 50.44.010, 50.44.020, 50.44.030, or 50.50.010, the term "employment" does not include service performed in agricultural labor by a farm intern providing his or her services under a farm internship program as established in RCW 49.12.471.

2. For purposes of this section, "agricultural labor" means:

   a. Services performed on a farm, in the employ of any person, in connection with the cultivation of the soil, or in connection with raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training, and management of livestock, bees, poultry, and furbearing animals and wildlife, or in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of a farm in connection with the operation, management, conservation, improvement, or maintenance of such farm and its tools and equipment;

   b. Services performed in packing, packaging, grading, storing, or delivering to storage, or to market or to a carrier for transportation to market, any agricultural or horticultural commodity; but only if such service is performed as an incident to ordinary farming operations.

## 50.04.155 - Service performed in agricultural labor for farm operator or crew leader.
1. Service performed in agricultural labor on and after January 1, 1978, for a farm operator or crew leader will be deemed services in employment if the farm operator or crew leader:

   a. Paid twenty thousand dollars or more as remuneration to individuals employed in agricultural labor during any calendar quarter in the current or preceding calendar year; or

   b. Employed ten or more individuals in agricultural labor for some portion of the day in each of twenty different calendar weeks in either the current or preceding calendar year regardless of whether they were employed at the same moment of time or whether or not the weeks were consecutive.

2. A farm operator is the owner or tenant of the farmlands who stands to gain or lose economically from the operations of the farm. Employment will be considered employment by the farm operator unless it is established to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the services were performed in the employ of a crew leader. The risk of nonpersuasion is upon the farm operator. The operator will nonetheless be liable for contributions under RCW 50.24.130 even though services performed on the operator's farmlands would not be sufficient to bring the services under the term employment if services performed on the operator's land in the employ of a crew leader would be covered and the crew leader has failed to pay contributions on the services. For the purposes of the preceding sentence and RCW 50.24.130, all moneys paid or payable to the crew leader by the farm operator shall be deemed paid for services unless there is a written contract clearly specifying the amounts of money to be attributed to items other than services of the crew leader or the crew leader's employees.

3. For the purposes of this section, a crew leader is a person who furnishes individuals to perform services in agricultural labor for the benefit of any other person, who pays for the services performed in agricultural labor (either on his or her own behalf or on behalf of the other person), and who has not made a written agreement making himself or herself an employee of the other person: PROVIDED, That no person shall be deemed a crew leader unless he or she is established independently of the person for whom the services are performed and either has a valid certificate of registration under the farm labor contractor registration act of 1963 or substantially all the members of his or her crew operate or maintain tractors, mechanized harvesting or crop dusting equipment, or any other mechanized equipment which is provided by the crew leader.

Services performed by a person appointed as an officer of a corporation under RCW 23B.08.400, other than those covered by chapters 50.44 and 50.50 RCW, shall not be considered services in employment. However, a corporation may elect to cover not less than all of its corporate officers under RCW 50.24.160. If an employer does not elect to cover its corporate officers under RCW 50.24.160, the employer must notify its corporate officers in writing that they are ineligible for unemployment benefits. However, if the employer fails to provide notice, the individual's status as a corporate officer is unchanged and the person remains ineligible for unemployment benefits.

   a. Except for services subject to RCW 50.44.010, 50.44.020, 50.44.030, or 50.50.010, the term "employment" includes an individual's entire service as an officer or member of a crew of an American vessel wherever performed and whether in intrastate or interstate or foreign commerce, if the employer maintains within this state at the beginning of the pay period an operating office from which the operations of the vessel are ordinarily and regularly supervised, managed, directed, and controlled.

1. For the purpose of payment of contributions, "wages" means the remuneration paid by one employer during any calendar year to an individual in its employment under this title or the unemployment compensation law of any other state in the amount specified in RCW 50.24.010. If an employer (hereinafter referred to as a successor employer) during any calendar year acquires substantially all the operating assets of another employer (hereinafter referred to as a predecessor employer) or assets used in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor employer, and immediately after the acquisition employs in the individual's trade or business an individual who immediately before the acquisition was employed in the trade or business of the predecessor employer, then, for the purposes of determining the amount of remuneration paid by the successor employer to the individual during the calendar year which is subject to contributions, any remuneration paid to the individual by the predecessor employer during that calendar year and before the acquisition shall be considered as having been paid by the successor employer.

2. For the purpose of payment of benefits, "wages" means the remuneration paid by one or more employers to an individual for employment under this title during his or her base year: PROVIDED, That at the request of a claimant, wages may be calculated on the basis of remuneration payable. The department shall notify each claimant that wages are calculated on the basis of remuneration paid, but at the claimant's request a redetermination may be performed and based on remuneration payable.

3. For the purpose of payment of benefits and payment of contributions, the term "wages" includes tips which are received after January 1, 1987, while performing services which constitute employment, and which are reported to the employer for federal income tax purposes.

4. [Empty]

   a. "Remuneration" means all compensation paid for personal services including commissions and bonuses and the cash value of all compensation paid in any medium other than cash. The reasonable cash value of compensation paid in any medium other than cash and the reasonable value of gratuities shall be estimated and determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the commissioner. Remuneration does not include payments to members of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States, including the organized militia of the state of Washington, for the performance of duty for periods not exceeding seventy-two hours at a time.

   b. Previously accrued compensation, other than severance pay or payments received pursuant to plant closure agreements, when assigned to a specific period of time by virtue of a collective bargaining agreement, individual employment contract, customary trade practice, or request of the individual compensated, shall be considered remuneration for the period to which it is assigned. Assignment clearly occurs when the compensation serves to make the individual eligible for all regular fringe benefits for the period to which the compensation is assigned.

   c. Settlements or other proceeds received by an individual as a result of a negotiated settlement for termination of an individual written employment contract prior to its expiration date shall be considered remuneration. The proceeds shall be deemed assigned in the same intervals and in the same amount for each interval as compensation was allocated under the contract.

   d. Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, the provisions of this subsection (4) pertaining to the assignment of previously accrued compensation shall not apply to individuals subject to RCW 50.44.050.
