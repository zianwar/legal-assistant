Such organization shall make payments to the unemployment compensation fund based on such services in accordance with the provisions of RCW 50.44.060.

\[ [1971 c 3 § 18](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971c3.pdf?cite=1971%20c%203%20§%2018); \]

The state shall make payments in lieu of contributions with respect to benefits attributable to such employment as provided with respect to nonprofit organizations in subsections (2) and (3) of RCW 50.44.060: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That for weeks of unemployment beginning after January 1, 1979, the state shall pay in addition to the full amount of regular and additional benefits so attributable the full amount of extended benefits so attributable: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That no payment will be required from the state until the expiration of the twelve-month period following the end of the biennium in which the benefits attributable to such employment were paid. The amount of this payment shall include an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have been realized for the benefit of the unemployment compensation trust fund had such payments been received within thirty days after the day of the quarterly billing provided for in RCW 50.44.060(2)(a).

## 50.44.030 - Political subdivisions, instrumentalities of this state and other state.
1. All services performed for any political subdivision or instrumentality of one or more political subdivisions of this state or one or more political subdivisions of this state and any other state after December 31, 1977, will be deemed to be services in employment to the extent coverage is not exempted under RCW 50.44.040.

2. All such units of government shall file, before December 15, 1977, a written registration with the commissioner of the employment security department. Such registration shall specify the manner in which the unit of government will finance the payment of benefits. The elections available to counties, cities and towns are the local government tax, provided for in RCW 50.44.035, or payment in lieu of contributions, as described in RCW 50.44.060. The elections available to other units of government are the contributions plan in chapters 50.24 and 50.29 RCW, or payments in lieu of contributions, described in RCW 50.44.060. Under any election the governmental unit will be charged the full amount of regular, additional, and extended benefits attributable to its account.

3. A unit of government may switch from its current method of financing the payment of benefits by electing any other method which it would be authorized to select pursuant to the terms of subsection (2) of this section. Notification of such election must be filed with the commissioner no less than thirty days prior to the taxable year for which the new method of financing the payment of benefits is to be effective. An election under this section shall remain in effect for no less than two taxable years.

4. Any political subdivision or instrumentality of more than one political subdivision of this state is hereby authorized to enter into agreements with other political subdivisions or instrumentalities of more than one political subdivision of this state to form pool accounts for the purpose of making payments in lieu of contributions. These accounts shall be formed and administered in accordance with applicable regulations. The formation of such accounts shall not relieve the governmental unit of the responsibility for making required payments in the event that the pool account does not make the payments.

## 50.44.035 - Local government tax.
1. Any county, city, or town not electing to make payments in lieu of contributions shall pay a "local government tax." Taxes paid under this section shall be paid into an administratively identifiable account in the unemployment compensation fund. This account shall be self-sustaining. For calendar years 1978 and 1979 all such employers shall pay local government tax at the rate of one and one-quarter percent of all remuneration paid by the governmental unit for services in its employment. For each year after 1979 each such employer's rate of tax shall be determined in accordance with this section: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That whenever it appears to the commissioner that the anticipated benefit payments from the account would jeopardize reasonable reserves in this identifiable account the commissioner may at the commencement of any calendar quarter, impose an emergency excess tax of not more than one percent of remuneration paid by the participating governmental units which "excess tax" shall be paid in addition to the applicable rate computed pursuant to this section until the calendar year following the next September 1st.

2. A reserve account shall be established for each such employer.

   a. The "reserve account" of each such employer shall be credited with tax amounts paid and shall be charged with benefit amounts charged in accordance with the formula set forth in RCW 50.44.060 as now or hereafter amended except that such employer's account shall be charged for the full amount of extended benefits so attributable for weeks of unemployment commencing after January 1, 1979. Such credits and charges shall be cumulative from January 1, 1978.

   b. After the cut-off date, the "reserve ratio" of each such employer shall be computed by dividing its reserve account balance as of the computation date by the total remuneration paid during the preceding calendar year for services in its employment. This division shall be carried to four decimal places, with the remaining fraction, if any, disregarded.

3. A "benefit cost ratio" for each such employer shall be computed by dividing its total benefit charges during the thirty-six months ending on June 30th by its total remuneration during the three preceding calendar years: PROVIDED, That after August 31st in 1979 each employer's total benefit charges for the twelve months ending on June 30th shall be divided by its total remuneration paid in the last three quarters of calendar year 1978; and after August 31st in 1980 each employer's total benefit charges for the twenty-four months ending June 30th shall be divided by its total remuneration paid in the last three calendar quarters of 1978 and the four calendar quarters of 1979. Such computations shall be carried to four decimal places, with the remaining fraction, if any, disregarded.

4. For each such employer its benefit cost ratio shall be subtracted from its reserve ratio. One-third of the resulting amount shall be subtracted from its benefit cost ratio. The resulting figure, expressed as a percentage and rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent, shall become its local government tax rate for the following rate year. For the rate year 1980 no tax rate shall be less than 0.6 percent nor more than 2.2 percent. For 1981 no tax rate shall be less than 0.4 percent nor more than 2.6 percent. For years after 1981 no tax rate shall be less than 0.2 percent or more than 3.0 percent. No individual rate shall be increased any more than 1.0 percent from one rate year to the next.

5. Any county, city, or town electing participation under this section at any time after December 15, 1977, shall be assigned a tax rate of one and one-quarter percent of total remuneration for the first eight quarters of the participation.

6. "Local government tax" shall be deemed to be "contributions" to the extent that such usage is consistent with the purposes of this title. Such construction shall include but not be limited to those portions of this title and the rules enacted pursuant thereto dealing with assessments, interest, penalties, liens, collection procedures and remedies, administrative and judicial review, and the imposition of administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.

## 50.44.050 - Benefits payable, terms and conditions—"Academic year" defined.
Except as otherwise provided in subsections (1) through (5) of this section, benefits based on services in employment covered by or pursuant to this chapter shall be payable on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other service subject to this title.

1. Benefits based on service in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution shall not be paid to an individual for any week of unemployment which commences during the period between two successive academic years or between two successive academic terms within an academic year (or, when an agreement provides instead for a similar period between two regular but not successive terms within an academic year, during such period) if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years or terms and if there is a contract or reasonable assurance that such individual will perform services in any such capacity for an educational institution in the second of such academic years or terms.

2. Benefits shall not be paid based on services in any other capacity for an educational institution for any week of unemployment which commences during the period between two successive academic years or between two successive academic terms within an academic year, if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the second of such academic years or terms: PROVIDED, That if benefits are denied to any individual under this subsection and that individual was not offered an opportunity to perform such services for the educational institution for the second of such academic years or terms, the individual is entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this subsection.

3. Benefits shall not be paid based on any services described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section for any week of unemployment which commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if such individual performs such services for an educational institution in the period immediately before such vacation period or holiday recess, and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services for an educational institution in the period immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess.

4. Benefits shall not be paid (as specified in subsections (1), (2), or (3) of this section) based on any services described in subsections (1) or (2) of this section to any individual who performed such services in any educational institution while in the employ of an educational service district which is established pursuant to chapter 28A.310 RCW and exists to provide services to local school districts.

5. When an individual performs services for more than one educational institution in an academic year or term, wages earned by the individual from those educational institutions that do not provide a contract or reasonable assurance of employment in the subsequent academic year or term may be used to establish a claim for benefits, even if a contract or reasonable assurance exists for another educational institution.

6. As used in this section, "academic year" means: Fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters or comparable semesters unless, based upon objective criteria including enrollment and staffing, the quarter or comparable semester is not in fact a part of the academic year for the particular institution.

## 50.44.053 - Education employees—Determination of "contract" or "reasonable assurance."
1. The following prerequisite requirements must be met before making a determination about whether there is a "contract," under RCW 50.44.050, or "reasonable assurance," under RCW 50.44.050 and 50.44.055:

   a. The offer of employment may be written, verbal, or implied, and must be made by an individual with actual authority to offer employment;

   b. The offer of employment provides that the employee will perform services in the same capacity during the ensuing academic year or term (or remainder of the current academic year or term) as in the first academic year or term; and

   c. The economic conditions of the offer of employment may not be considerably less in the following academic year or term (or portion thereof) than in the first academic year or term (or portion thereof). "Considerably less" includes the condition that the individual will not earn at least ninety percent of the wages earned in the prior academic year or term.

2. If all prerequisite requirements in subsection (1) of this section are satisfied, the department must determine if a contract exists. If any prerequisite in subsection (1) of this section is not satisfied, the department may not deny the claimant unemployment compensation based on the between and within term denial provisions. The term "contract," as that term is used in this section and RCW 50.44.050, means an enforceable, noncontingent agreement that provides for compensation for an entire academic year or on an annual basis. If a contract exists, the claimant may be subject to a denial of benefits.

3. If no contract exists, the department must determine if the claimant has "reasonable assurance." The following factors will be considered in determining if an individual has "reasonable assurance," as that term is used in this section, RCW 50.44.050, and 50.44.055. For reasonable assurance to exist, each factor must be satisfied.

   a. If any contingencies in the employment offer are within the employer's control the claimant will not be considered to have reasonable assurance of employment. Contingencies within the employer's control include, but are not limited to:

      i. Course programming;

      ii. Funding allocation decisions;

      iii. Final course offerings; and

      iv. Facility availability.

   b. If contingencies are not within the employer's control, the department must determine whether it is highly probable the contingencies contained within the offer will be satisfied. Primary weight will be given to the contingent nature of an offer of employment.

   c. Reasonable assurance must be determined on a case-by-case basis considering the totality of circumstances rather than on the existence of any one factor. For an individual to have reasonable assurance of employment, the totality of the circumstances must show that it is highly probable that employment will be available in the next academic year or term, and that the contingencies of that employment will be satisfied.

4. An individual who is tenured or holds tenure track status is considered to have reasonable assurance, unless advised otherwise by the college. For the purposes of this section, tenure track status means a probationary faculty employee having an opportunity to be reviewed for tenure.

## 50.44.055 - Finding—Intent—Reasonable assurance, application to employees of educational institutions.
The legislature finds the interests of the state and its citizens are best served by a strong education system. Paramount to that system's success is the attraction and retention of qualified instructors. In order to attract and retain instructors, those who are subject to uncertainties of employment must be provided assurance that their economic needs are addressed. Contingent assurances of future employment are often speculative and do not rise to the level of other forms of assurance. As such, the factors presented in RCW 50.44.053 must be used to determine if reasonable assurance of employment exists.

It is the intent of the legislature that reasonable assurance continue to apply to all employees of educational institutions as required by federal provisions and RCW 50.44.080.

1. Any nonprofit organization which is, or becomes subject to this title, shall pay contributions under the provisions of RCW 50.24.010 and chapter 50.29 RCW, unless it elects, in accordance with this subsection, to pay to the commissioner for the unemployment compensation fund an amount equal to the full amount of regular and additional benefits and one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid to individuals for weeks of unemployment that are based upon wages paid or payable during the effective period of such election to the extent that such payments are attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization.

   a. Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this title may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than twelve months beginning with the date on which such subjectivity begins by filing a written notice of its election with the commissioner not later than thirty days immediately following the date of the determination of such subjectivity.

   b.

   c. Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this title may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the commissioner not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of any taxable year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions.

          A.  The percentage of its total payroll for the immediately preceding calendar year as the commissioner shall determine. Such determination shall be based each year on the average benefit costs attributable to service in the employ of nonprofit organizations during the preceding calendar year.

          B.  For any organization which did not pay wages throughout the four calendar quarters of the preceding calendar year, such percentage of its payroll during such year as the commissioner shall determine.

      iii. At the end of each taxable year, the commissioner may modify the quarterly percentage of payroll thereafter payable by the nonprofit organization in order to minimize excess or insufficient payments.

      iv. At the end of each taxable year, the commissioner shall determine whether the total of payments for such year made by a nonprofit organization is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular and additional benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid to individuals during such taxable year based on wages attributable to service in the employ of such organization. Each nonprofit organization whose total payments for such year are less than the amount so determined shall be liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with (c) of this subsection. If the total payments exceed the amount so determined for the taxable year, all of the excess payments will be retained in the fund as part of the payments which may be required for the next taxable year, or a part of the excess may, at the discretion of the commissioner, be refunded from the fund or retained in the fund as part of the payments which may be required for the next taxable year.

   c. Payment of any bill rendered under (a) or (b) of this subsection shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill was mailed to the last known address of the nonprofit organization or was otherwise delivered to it, and if not paid within such thirty days, the reimbursement payments itemized in the bill shall be deemed to be delinquent and the whole or part thereof remaining unpaid shall bear interest and penalties from and after the end of such thirty days at the rate and in the manner set forth in RCW 50.12.220 and 50.24.040.

3. Each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the commissioner for the fund the total amount of regular and additional benefits plus the amount of one-half of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of (a) and (b) of this subsection.

   a. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by one or more employers that are liable for payments in lieu of contributions and on wages paid by one or more employers who are liable for contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base-period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base-period wages paid to the individual by all of his or her base-period employers.

   b. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by two or more employers that are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each such employer shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base-period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base-period wages paid to the individual by all of his or her base-period employers.

## 50.44.070 - Election to make payments in lieu of contributions—Bond or deposit.
In the discretion of the commissioner, any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required within thirty days after the effective date of its election, to execute and file with the commissioner a surety bond approved by the commissioner or it may elect instead to deposit with the commissioner money or securities. The amount of such bond or deposit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section.

1. The amount of the bond or deposit required by this subsection shall be an amount deemed by the commissioner to be sufficient to cover any reimbursement payments which may be required from the employer attributable to employment during any year for which the election is in effect but in no event shall such amount be in excess of the amount which said employer would pay for such year if he or she were subject to the contribution provisions of this title. The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on payroll information, employment experience, and such other factors as the commissioner deems pertinent.

2. Any bond deposited under this section shall be in force for a period of not less than two taxable years and shall be renewed with the approval of the commissioner, at such times as the commissioner may prescribe, but not less frequently than at two-year intervals as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The commissioner shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as he or she deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within thirty days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided for in this title, shall render the surety liable on said bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization.

3. Any deposit of money or securities in accordance with this section shall be retained by the commissioner in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The commissioner may deduct from the money deposited under this section by a nonprofit organization or sell the securities it has so deposited to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in this act. The commissioner shall require the organization within thirty days following any deduction from a money deposit or sale of deposited securities under the provisions of this subsection to deposit sufficient additional money or securities to make whole the organization's deposit at the prior level. Any cash remaining from the sale of such securities shall be a part of the organization's escrow account. The commissioner may, at any time review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, he or she determines that an adjustment is necessary he or she shall require the organization to make an additional deposit within thirty days of written notice of his or her determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as he or she no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from securities held in escrow shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the state law.

4. If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this section, the commissioner may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the four-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which termination becomes effective: PROVIDED, That the commissioner may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit, or adjustment period by not more than thirty days.

## 50.44.080 - Construction—Compliance with federal unemployment tax act, department of labor guidelines.
In view of the importance of compliance of this chapter with the federal unemployment tax act, any ambiguities contained herein should be resolved in a manner consistent with the provisions of that act. Department of labor guidelines implementing chapter 99, Laws of 2001 should be referred to when interpreting the provisions of this chapter.

## 50.44.090 - Construction—Mandatory coverage of employees of political subdivision under 1977 ex.s. c 292.
1. The provisions of chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. mandating coverage of employees of political subdivisions have been enacted to comply with the provisions of Public Law 94-566. Therefore, as provided in subsection (2), this mandatory feature shall be contingent on the existence of valid and constitutional federal law requiring the Secretary of Labor to refuse to certify as approved the employment security laws of this state if such laws did not continue such mandatory coverage.

2. In the event the mandatory coverage feature for political subdivisions ceases to be necessary for compliance with valid and constitutional federal law, then the mandatory feature of chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. shall cease to be effective as of the end of the next quarter following the quarter in which the mandatory feature contained in chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. is not necessary for such compliance.

3. In the event mandatory coverage ceases to be effective pursuant to subsection (2), then the sections, or subsections as the case may be, of chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. shall to the extent that they apply to coverage of employees of political subdivisions be deemed nullified and the language of the sections being amended shall be deemed reinstated as the laws of this state.

4. Benefits paid based on the services covered during the effective life of the mandatory coverage feature shall be financed as follows:

   a. If the political subdivision was financing payment of benefits on a reimbursable basis, benefits attributable to employment with the political subdivision shall be assessed to and paid by the political subdivision;

   b. If the political subdivision is a county, city, or town which elected financing pursuant to RCW 50.44.035, such political subdivision will pay "the local government tax" for all earnings by employees through the end of the calendar quarter in which the mandatory coverage is no longer effective pursuant to subsection (2);

   c. If the political subdivision was financing benefits by the contribution method it will pay contributions on wages earned by its employees through the end of the calendar quarter in which mandatory coverage is no longer effective pursuant to subsection (2).
