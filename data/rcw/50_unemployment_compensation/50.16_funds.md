## 50.16.030 - Withdrawals from federal unemployment trust fund.
1. Moneys shall be requisitioned from this state's account in the unemployment trust fund solely for the payment of benefits and repayment of loans from the federal government to guarantee solvency of the unemployment compensation fund in accordance with regulations prescribed by the commissioner, except that money credited to this state's account pursuant to section 903 of the social security act, as amended, shall be used exclusively as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The commissioner shall from time to time requisition from the unemployment trust fund such amounts, not exceeding the amounts standing to its account therein, as the commissioner deems necessary for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period. Upon receipt thereof the treasurer shall deposit such moneys in the benefit account and shall issue his or her warrants for the payment of benefits solely from such benefits account.

2. Expenditures of such moneys in the benefit account and refunds from the clearing account shall not be subject to any provisions of law requiring specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money in their custody, and RCW 43.01.050, as amended, shall not apply. All warrants issued by the treasurer for the payment of benefits and refunds shall bear the signature of the treasurer and the countersignature of the commissioner, or his or her duly authorized agent for that purpose.

3. Any balance of moneys requisitioned from the unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which sums were requisitioned shall either be deducted from estimates for, and may be utilized for the payment of, benefits during succeeding periods, or in the discretion of the commissioner, shall be redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States of America to the credit of this state's account in the unemployment trust fund.

4. Money credited to the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund by the secretary of the treasury of the United States of America pursuant to section 903 of the social security act, as amended, may be requisitioned and used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this title pursuant to a specific appropriation by the legislature, provided that the expenses are incurred and the money is requisitioned after the enactment of an appropriation law which:

   a. Specifies the purposes for which such money is appropriated and the amounts appropriated therefor;

   b. Limits the period within which such money may be obligated to a period ending not more than two years after the date of the enactment of the appropriation law; and

   c. Limits the amount which may be obligated during a twelve-month period beginning on July 1st and ending on the next June 30th to an amount which does not exceed the amount by which (i) the aggregate of the amounts credited to the account of this state pursuant to section 903 of the social security act, as amended, during the same twelve-month period and the thirty-four preceding twelve-month periods, exceeds (ii) the aggregate of the amounts obligated pursuant to subsections (4) through (6) of this section and charged against the amounts credited to the account of this state during any of such thirty-five twelve-month periods. For the purposes of subsections (4) through (6) of this section, amounts obligated during any such twelve-month period shall be charged against equivalent amounts which were first credited and which are not already so charged; except that no amount obligated for administration during any such twelve-month period may be charged against any amount credited during such a twelve-month period earlier than the thirty-fourth twelve-month period preceding such period: PROVIDED, That any amount credited to this state's account under section 903 of the social security act, as amended, which has been appropriated for expenses of administration, whether or not withdrawn from the trust fund shall be excluded from the unemployment compensation fund balance for the purpose of experience rating credit determination.

5. Money credited to the account of this state pursuant to section 903 of the social security act, as amended, may not be withdrawn or used except for the payment of benefits and for the payment of expenses of administration and of public employment offices pursuant to subsections (4) through (6) of this section.

6. Money requisitioned as provided in subsections (4) through (6) of this section for the payment of expenses of administration shall be deposited in the unemployment compensation fund, but until expended, shall remain a part of the unemployment compensation fund. The commissioner shall maintain a separate record of the deposit, obligation, expenditure and return of funds so deposited. Any money so deposited which either will not be obligated within the period specified by the appropriation law or remains unobligated at the end of the period, and any money which has been obligated within the period but will not be expended, shall be returned promptly to the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund.

## 50.16.100 - COVID-19 unemployment account.
1. The COVID-19 unemployment account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Revenues to the account shall consist of appropriations and transfers by the legislature and all other funding directed for deposit into the account. Only the commissioner of the employment security department or the commissioner's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for reimbursing the unemployment trust fund account for unemployment benefits paid to the approved employees of employers approved for such reimbursement pursuant to *RCW 50.29.100. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

2. Any federal funding or relief for novel coronavirus that could be used for the purposes of *RCW 50.29.100 must be used first before spending from the account. Additionally, if the employment security department subsequently receives reimbursements from federal sources for amounts spent from the account, the department must remit the federal funding to the state treasurer for reimbursement to the budget stabilization account. If federal law or rules would prevent such remittance, the department must notify the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature within thirty days of receipt of the reimbursement.

3. By July 1, 2021, the commissioner must certify to the state treasurer the amount of any unobligated moneys in the COVID-19 unemployment account that are attributable to the budget stabilization account appropriation in section 3, chapter 7, Laws of 2020, and the treasurer must transfer those moneys back to the budget stabilization account.
