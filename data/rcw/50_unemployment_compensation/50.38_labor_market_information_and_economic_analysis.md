## 50.38.010 - Intent.
It is the intent of this chapter to establish the duties and authority of the employment security department relating to labor market information and economic analysis. State and federal law mandate the use of labor market information in the planning, coordinating, management, implementation, and evaluation of certain programs. Often this labor market information is also needed in studies for the legislature and state programs, like those dealing with growth management, community diversification, export assistance, prison industries, energy, agriculture, social services, and environment. Employment, training, education, job creation, and other programs are often mandated without adequate federal or state funding for the needed labor market information. Clarification of the department's duties and authority will assist users of state and local labor market information products and services to have realistic expectations and provide the department authority to recover actual costs for labor market information products and services developed in response to individual requests.

## 50.38.015 - Definitions.
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Labor market information" means the body of information generated from measurement and evaluation of the socioeconomic factors and variables influencing the employment process in the state and specific labor market areas. These socioeconomic factors and variables affect labor demand and supply relationships and include:

   a. Labor force information, which includes but is not limited to employment, unemployment, labor force participation, labor turnover and mobility, average hours and earnings, and changes and characteristics of the population and labor force within specific labor market areas and the state;

   b. Occupational information, which includes but is not limited to occupational supply and demand estimates and projections, characteristics of occupations, wage levels, job duties, training and education requirements, conditions of employment, unionization, retirement practices, and training opportunities;

   c. Economic information, which includes but is not limited to number of business starts and stops by industry and labor market area, information on employment growth and decline by industry and labor market area, employer establishment data, and number of labor-management disputes by industry and labor market area; and

   d. Program information, which includes but is not limited to program participant or student information gathered in cooperation with other state and local agencies along with related labor market information to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of state and local employment, training, education, and job creation efforts in support of planning, management, implementation, and evaluation.

2. "Labor market area" means an economically integrated geographic area within which individuals can reside and find employment within a reasonable distance or can readily change employment without changing their place of residence. Such areas shall be identified in accordance with criteria used by the bureau of labor statistics of the department of labor in defining such areas or similar criteria established by the governor. The area generally takes the name of its community. The boundaries depend primarily on economic and geographic factors. Washington state is divided into labor market areas, which usually include a county or a group of contiguous counties.

3. "Labor market analysis" means the measurement and evaluation of economic forces as they relate to the employment process in the local labor market area. Variables affecting labor market relationships include, but are not limited to, such factors as labor force changes and characteristics, population changes and characteristics, industrial structure and development, technological developments, shifts in consumer demand, volume and extent of unionization and trade disputes, recruitment practices, wage levels, conditions of employment, and training opportunities.

4. "Public records" has the same meaning as set forth in RCW 42.56.010.

5. "Department" means the employment security department.
