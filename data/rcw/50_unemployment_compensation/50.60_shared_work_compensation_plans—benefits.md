## 50.60.010 - Legislative intent.
In order to provide an economic climate conducive to the retention of skilled workers in industries adversely affected by general economic downturns and to supplement depressed buying power of employees affected by such downturns, the legislature finds that the public interest would be served by the enactment of laws providing greater flexibility in the payment of unemployment compensation benefits in situations where qualified employers elect to retain employees at reduced hours rather than instituting layoffs.

\[ [1983 c 207 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c207.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20207%20§%201); \]

3. "Shared work benefits" means the benefits payable to an affected employee under an approved shared work compensation plan as distinguished from the benefits otherwise payable under this title.

4. "Shared work compensation plan" means a plan of an employer, or of an employers' association, under which there is a reduction in the number of hours worked by employees rather than layoffs.

5. "Shared work employer" means an employer, who has at least two employees, and at least two employees are covered by a shared work compensation plan.

## 50.60.030 - Compensation plan—Criteria for approval.
An employer or employers' association wishing to participate in a shared work compensation program shall submit a written and signed shared work compensation plan to the commissioner for approval. The commissioner shall approve a shared work compensation plan only if the following criteria are met:

1. The plan identifies the affected employees to which it applies;

2. Each affected employee is identified by name, social security number, and by any other information required by the commissioner;

3. The usual weekly hours of work for each affected employee are reduced by not less than ten percent and not more than fifty percent;

4. The employer certifies health benefits will continue to be provided under the same terms and conditions as when the affected employee worked his or her usual weekly hours of work. Affected employees must be allowed to maintain coverage under the same terms and conditions as employees not participating in the shared work compensation plan. However, a change in health benefits applicable to employees who are not participating in the shared work compensation plan may also apply to affected employees;

5. The employer certifies retirement benefits under a defined benefit plan or contributions under a defined contribution plan will continue to be provided under the same terms and conditions as when the affected employee worked his or her usual weekly hours of work. Affected employees must be allowed to maintain coverage in the retirement plan under the same terms and conditions as employees not participating in the shared work compensation plan. However, a reduction in benefits under a defined benefit plan or a reduction in contributions under a defined contribution plan applicable to employees who are not participating in the shared work compensation plan may also apply to affected employees;

6. The employer certifies paid vacation, holidays, and sick leave continue to be provided under the same terms and conditions as when the affected employee worked his or her usual weekly hours of work. Affected employees must be allowed to maintain these benefits under the same terms and conditions as employees not participating in the shared work compensation plan. However, a reduction in these benefits applicable to employees who are not participating in the shared work compensation plan may also apply to affected employees;

7. The plan certifies that the aggregate reduction in work hours for each affected employee is in lieu of layoffs which would have resulted in an equivalent reduction in work hours;

8. The plan is approved in writing by the collective bargaining agent for each collective bargaining agreement covering any affected employee;

9. The plan will not subsidize seasonal employers during the off season;

10. The employer agrees to furnish reports necessary for the proper administration of the plan and to permit access by the commissioner to all records necessary to verify the plan before approval and after approval to evaluate the application of the plan;

11. The plan includes an estimate of the number of layoffs that would have occurred absent the ability to participate in shared work;

12. The shared work compensation plan includes a plan to give advance notice, when feasible, to an employee whose usual weekly hours of work will be reduced. If not feasible, the shared work compensation plan must explain why it is not feasible; and

13. The employer must attest that participation is consistent with employer obligations under federal and state law.

In addition to subsections (1) through (13) of this section, the commissioner shall take into account any other factors which may be pertinent.

## 50.60.040 - Compensation plan—Approval or rejection—Resubmission.
The commissioner shall approve or reject a shared work compensation plan in writing within fifteen days of its receipt. The reasons for the rejection shall be final and nonappealable, but the rejection shall not prevent an employer from submitting another plan for approval not earlier than fifteen days after the date of a previous written rejection.

\[ [1983 c 207 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c207.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20207%20§%204); \]

## 50.60.050 - Approved plan—Misrepresentation—Penalties.
If an approved plan or any representation for implementation of the plan is intentionally and substantially misleading or false, any individual who participated in any such misrepresentation shall be subject to criminal prosecution as well as personal liability for any amount of benefits deemed by the commissioner to have been improperly paid from the fund as a result thereof. This provision for personal liability is in addition to any remedy against individual claimants for collection of overpayment of benefits if such claimants participated in or were otherwise at fault in the overpayment.

\[ [1983 c 207 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c207.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20207%20§%205); \]

## 50.60.060 - Approved plan—Effective date—Expiration.

The plan shall expire at the end of the twelfth full calendar month after its effective date, or on the date specified in the plan if that date is earlier, unless the plan is revoked before that date by the commissioner. If a plan is revoked by the commissioner, it shall terminate on the date specified in the commissioner's order of revocation.

\[ [2009 c 3 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1906-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%203%20§%209); [1983 c 207 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c207.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20207%20§%206); \]

## 50.60.070 - Approved plan—Revocation—Review of plans.
The commissioner may revoke approval of a shared work compensation plan for good cause. The revocation order shall be in writing and shall specify the date the revocation is effective and the reasons for the revocation. Good cause for revocation shall include failure to comply with the assurances given in the plan, unreasonable revision of productivity standards, conduct or occurrences tending to defeat the intent and effective operation of the plan, and violation of the criteria on which approval of the plan was based.

Such action may be initiated at any time by the commissioner on his or her own motion, on the motion of any of the affected employees, or on the motion of the appropriate collective bargaining agents. The commissioner shall review each plan at least once within the twelve-month period the plan is in effect to assure that it continues to meet the requirements of this chapter.

\[ [2009 c 3 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1906-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%203%20§%2010); [1983 c 207 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c207.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20207%20§%207); \]

## 50.60.080 - Approved plan—Modification.
An approved shared work compensation plan in effect may be modified with the approval of the commissioner. If the hours of work are increased or decreased beyond the level in the original plan, or any other condition is changed, the employer shall promptly notify the commissioner. If the changes meet the requirements for approval of a plan, the commissioner shall approve the modifications. This approval shall not change the expiration date of the original plan. If the modifications do not meet the requirements for approval, the commissioner shall revoke the plan as specified in RCW 50.60.060.

\[ [1983 c 207 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c207.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20207%20§%208); \]

## 50.60.090 - Shared work benefits—Eligibility.
An individual is eligible to receive shared work benefits with respect to any week only if, in addition to meeting the conditions of eligibility for other benefits under this title, the commissioner finds that:

1. The individual was employed during that week as an affected employee under an approved shared work compensation plan which was in effect for that week;

2. The affected employee was able to work and was available for his or her usual weekly hours of work with the shared work employer; and
