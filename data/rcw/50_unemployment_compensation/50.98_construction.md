## 50.98.100 - Base year wages to include remuneration paid for previously uncovered services.
1. Effective with benefit years beginning on and after January 1, 1978, base year wages shall include remuneration paid for previously uncovered services: PROVIDED, That the maximum benefits payable to an individual as computed for the benefit year will be reduced to the extent that benefits were paid on the basis of identical calendar quarters of the previously uncovered services with respect to a claim filed by the individual under Title II of the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974.

2. For the purposes of this section, the term "previously uncovered services" means services performed before January 1, 1978, which are not employment as defined in Title 50 RCW at any time during the one year period ending December 31, 1975, and which:

   a. Is agricultural labor as defined in RCW 50.04.150 and covered by RCW 50.04.155 or domestic services as defined in and covered by RCW 50.04.160; or

   b. Is service performed by an employee of this state or a political subdivision of this state newly covered by chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. or by an employee of a nonprofit educational institution which is not an institution of higher education as provided in *RCW 50.44.040(3).

4. Benefits paid any individual whose base year wages include wages for previously uncovered services as defined in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer to the extent that the unemployment compensation fund is reimbursed for the benefits under section 121 of PL 94-566.

## 50.98.110 - Compliance with federal unemployment tax act—Internal references—Interpretation.
Chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. has been enacted to meet the requirements imposed by the federal unemployment tax act as amended by PL 94-566. Internal references in any section of chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. to the provisions of that act are intended only to apply to those provisions as they existed as of *the effective date of chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess.

In view of the importance of compliance of chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess. with the federal unemployment tax act, any ambiguities contained herein should be resolved in a manner consistent with the provisions of that act. Considerable weight has been given to the commentary contained in that document entitled "Draft Language and Commentary to Implement the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 PL 94-566", published by the United States department of labor, employment and training administration, and that commentary should be referred to when interpreting the provisions of chapter 292, Laws of 1977 ex. sess.
