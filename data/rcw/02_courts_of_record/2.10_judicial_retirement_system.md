\[ [2011 c 336 § 27](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5045.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20336%20§%2027); [1988 c 109 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c109.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20109%20§%207); [1984 c 37 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c37.pdf?cite=1984%20c%2037%20§%202); [1971 ex.s. c 267 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c267.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20267%20§%2014); \]

## 2.10.144 - Payment of accumulated contributions or retirement allowance upon death—Election.
1. If a judge dies before the date of retirement, the amount of the accumulated contributions standing to the judge's credit at the time of death shall be paid to the member's estate, or such person or persons, trust, or organization as the judge has nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the department of retirement systems. If there is no such designated person or persons still living at the time of the judge's death, or if the judge fails to file a new beneficiary designation subsequent to marriage, remarriage, dissolution of marriage, divorce, or reestablishment of membership following termination by withdrawal or retirement, the judge's credited accumulated contributions shall be paid to the surviving spouse as if in fact the spouse had been nominated by written designation or, if there is no such surviving spouse, then to the judge's legal representatives.

2. Upon the death in service of any judge who is qualified but has not applied for a service retirement allowance or has completed ten years of service at the time of death, the designated beneficiary, or the surviving spouse as provided in subsection (1) of this section, may elect to waive the payment provided by subsection (1) of this section. Upon such an election, a joint and one hundred percent survivor option under RCW 2.10.146 shall automatically be given effect as if selected for the benefit of the surviving spouse or dependent who is the designated beneficiary, except that if the judge is not then qualified for a service retirement allowance, the option II benefit shall be based upon the actuarial equivalent of the sum necessary to pay the accrued regular retirement allowance commencing when the deceased judge would have first qualified for a service retirement allowance. However, subsection (1) of this section, unless elected, shall not apply to any judge who has applied for a service retirement and thereafter dies between the date of separation from service and the judge's effective retirement date, where the judge has selected a survivorship option under RCW 2.10.146(1)(b). In those cases, the beneficiary named in the judge's final application for service retirement may elect to receive either a cash refund or monthly payments according to the option selected by the judge.

\[ [1995 c 144 § 20](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1295.SL.pdf?cite=1995%20c%20144%20§%2020); [1990 c 249 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c249.pdf?cite=1990%20c%20249%20§%2013); [1988 c 109 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c109.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20109%20§%208); \]

## 2.10.146 - Election of option for payment of retirement or disability allowance—Retirement allowance adjustment.
1. Upon making application for a service retirement allowance under RCW 2.10.100 or a disability allowance under RCW 2.10.120, a judge who is eligible therefor shall make an election as to the manner in which such service retirement shall be paid from among the following designated options, calculated so as to be actuarially equivalent to each other:

   a. Standard allowance. A member selecting this option shall receive a retirement allowance, which shall be computed as provided in RCW 2.10.110. The retirement allowance shall be payable throughout the judge's life. However, if the judge dies before the total of the retirement allowance paid to the judge equals the amount of the judge's accumulated contributions at the time of retirement, then the balance shall be paid to the member's estate, or such person or persons, trust, or organization as the judge has nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the department of retirement systems or, if there is no such designated person or persons still living at the time of the judge's death, then to the surviving spouse or, if there is neither such designated person or persons still living at the time of death nor a surviving spouse, then to the judge's legal representative.

   b. The department shall adopt rules that allow a judge to select a retirement option that pays the judge a reduced retirement allowance and upon death, such portion of the judge's reduced retirement allowance as the department by rule designates shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to a designated person. Such person shall be nominated by the judge by written designation duly executed and filed with the department at the time of retirement. The options adopted by the department shall include, but are not limited to, a joint and one hundred percent survivor option and a joint and fifty percent survivor option.

2. [Empty]

   a. A judge, if married, must provide the written consent of his or her spouse to the option selected under this section, except as provided in (b) of this subsection. If a judge is married and both the judge and the judge's spouse do not give written consent to an option under this section, the department will pay the judge a joint and fifty percent survivor benefit and record the judge's spouse as the beneficiary. Such benefit shall be calculated to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit options available under subsection (1) of this section unless spousal consent is not required as provided in (b) of this subsection.

   b. If a copy of a dissolution order designating a survivor beneficiary under RCW 41.50.790 has been filed with the department at least thirty days prior to a member's retirement:

      i. The department shall honor the designation as if made by the member under subsection (1) of this section; and

      ii. The spousal consent provisions of (a) of this subsection do not apply.

3. [Empty]
