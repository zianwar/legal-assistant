## 46.44.010 - Outside width limit.
The total outside width of any vehicle or load thereon must not exceed eight and one-half feet; except that an externally mounted rear vision mirror may extend beyond the width limits of the vehicle body to a point that allows the driver a view to the rear of the vehicle along both sides in conformance with Federal National Safety Standard 111 (49 C.F.R. 571.111), and RCW 46.37.400. Excluded from this calculation of width are certain devices that provide added safety, energy conservation, or are otherwise necessary, and are not designed or used to carry cargo. The width-exclusive devices must be identified in rules adopted by the department of transportation under RCW 46.44.101. A width-exclusive device must not extend more than three inches beyond the width limit of the vehicle body.

## 46.44.020 - Maximum height—Impaired clearance signs.
It is unlawful for any vehicle unladen or with load to exceed a height of fourteen feet above the level surface upon which the vehicle stands. This height limitation does not apply to authorized emergency vehicles or repair equipment of a public utility engaged in reasonably necessary operation. The provisions of this section do not relieve the owner or operator of a vehicle or combination of vehicles from the exercise of due care in determining that sufficient vertical clearance is provided upon the public highways where the vehicle or combination of vehicles is being operated; and no liability may attach to the state or to any county, city, town, or other political subdivision by reason of any damage or injury to persons or property by reason of the existence of any structure over or across any public highway where the vertical clearance above the roadway is fourteen feet or more; or, where the vertical clearance is less than fourteen feet, if impaired clearance signs of a design approved by the state department of transportation are erected and maintained on the right side of any such public highway in accordance with the manual of uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways as adopted by the state department of transportation under chapter 47.36 RCW. If any structure over or across any public highway is not owned by the state or by a county, city, town, or other political subdivision, it is the duty of the owner thereof when billed therefor to reimburse the state department of transportation or the county, city, town, or other political subdivision having jurisdiction over the highway for the actual cost of erecting and maintaining the impaired clearance signs, but no liability may attach to the owner by reason of any damage or injury to persons or property caused by impaired vertical clearance above the roadway.

## 46.44.041 - Maximum gross weights—Wheelbase and axle factors.
No vehicle or combination of vehicles shall operate upon the public highways of this state with a gross load on any single axle in excess of twenty thousand pounds, or upon any group of axles in excess of that set forth in the following table, except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of thirty-four thousand pounds each, if the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is thirty-six feet or more.

The following table is based on the following formula: W = 500((LN/N-1)+12N+36). W is the maximum weight in pounds (to the nearest 500 pounds) carried on any group of two (2) or more consecutive axles. L is the distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two (2) or more consecutive axles. N is the number of axles under consideration.

When inches are involved: Under six inches take lower, six inches or over take higher. The maximum load on any axle in any group of axles shall not exceed the single axle or tandem axle allowance as set forth in the table above.

The maximum axle and gross weights specified in this section are subject to the braking requirements set up for the service brakes upon any motor vehicle or combination of vehicles as provided by law.

Loads of not more than eighty thousand pounds which may be legally hauled in the state bordering this state which also has a sales tax, are legal in this state when moving to a port district within four miles of the bordering state except on the interstate system. This provision does not allow the operation of a vehicle combination consisting of a truck tractor and three trailers.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein, a vehicle or combination of vehicles in operation on January 4, 1975, may operate upon the public highways of this state, including the interstate system within the meaning of section 127 of Title 23, United States Code, with an overall gross weight upon a group of two consecutive sets of dual axles which was lawful in this state under the laws, regulations, and procedures in effect in this state on January 4, 1975.

## 46.44.042 - Maximum gross weights—Axle and tire factors.
Subject to the maximum gross weights specified in RCW 46.44.041, it is unlawful to operate any vehicle upon the public highways with a gross weight, including load, upon any tire concentrated upon the surface of the highway in excess of six hundred pounds per inch width of such tire. An axle manufactured after July 31, 1993, carrying more than ten thousand pounds gross weight must be equipped with four or more tires. An axle carrying more than ten thousand pounds gross weight must have four or more tires, regardless of date of manufacture. Instead of the four or more tires per axle requirements of this section, an axle may be equipped with two tires limited to five hundred pounds per inch width of tire. This section does not apply to vehicles operating under oversize or overweight permits, or both, issued under RCW 46.44.090, while carrying a nonreducible load.

The following equipment may operate at six hundred pounds per inch width of tire: (1) A nonliftable steering axle or axles on the power unit; (2) a tiller axle on firefighting apparatus; (3) a rear booster trailing axle equipped with two tires on a ready-mix concrete transit truck; and (4) a straddle trailer manufactured before January 1, 1996, equipped with single-tire axles or a single axle using a walking beam supported by two in-line single tires and used exclusively for the transport of fruit bins between field, storage, and processing. A straddle trailer manufactured after January 1, 1996, meeting this use criteria may carry five hundred fifteen pounds per inch width of tire on sixteen and one-half inch wide tires.

For the purpose of this section, the width of tire in case of solid rubber or hollow center cushion tires, so long as the use thereof may be permitted by the law, shall be measured between the flanges of the rim. For the purpose of this section, the width of tires in case of pneumatic tires shall be the maximum overall normal inflated width as stipulated by the manufacturer when inflated to the pressure specified and without load thereon.

The department of transportation, by rule with respect to state highways, and a local authority, with respect to a public highway under its jurisdiction, may extend the weight table in RCW 46.44.041 to one hundred fifteen thousand pounds. However, the extension must be in compliance with federal law, and vehicles operating under the extension must be in full compliance with the 1997 axle and tire requirements under this section.

## 46.44.047 - Excess weight—Logging trucks—Special permits—County or city permits—Fees—Discretion of arresting officer.
A three axle truck tractor and a two axle pole trailer combination engaged in the operation of hauling logs may exceed by not more than six thousand eight hundred pounds the legal gross weight of the combination of vehicles when licensed, as permitted by law, for sixty-eight thousand pounds: PROVIDED, That the distance between the first and last axle of the vehicles in combination shall have a total wheelbase of not less than thirty-seven feet, and the weight upon two axles spaced less than seven feet apart shall not exceed thirty-three thousand six hundred pounds.

Such additional allowances shall be permitted by a special permit to be issued by the department of transportation valid only on state primary or secondary highways authorized by the department and under such rules, regulations, terms, and conditions prescribed by the department. The fee for such special permit shall be fifty dollars for a twelve-month period beginning and ending on April 1st of each calendar year. Permits may be issued at any time, but if issued after July 1st of any year the fee shall be thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents. If issued on or after October 1st the fee shall be twenty-five dollars, and if issued on or after January 1st the fee shall be twelve dollars and fifty cents. A copy of such special permit covering the vehicle involved shall be carried in the cab of the vehicle at all times. Upon the third offense within the duration of the permit for violation of the terms and conditions of the special permit, the special permit shall be canceled. The vehicle covered by such canceled special permit shall not be eligible for a new special permit until thirty days after the cancellation of the special permit issued to said vehicle. The fee for such renewal shall be at the same rate as set forth in this section which covers the original issuance of such special permit. Each special permit shall be assigned to a three-axle truck tractor in combination with a two-axle pole trailer. When the department issues a duplicate permit to replace a lost or destroyed permit and where the department transfers a permit, a fee of fourteen dollars shall be charged for each such duplicate issued or each such transfer.

All fees collected hereinabove shall be deposited with the state treasurer and credited to the motor vehicle fund.

Permits involving city streets or county roads or using city streets or county roads to reach or leave state highways, authorized for permit by the department may be issued by the city or county or counties involved. A fee of five dollars for such city or county permit may be assessed by the city or by the county legislative authority which shall be deposited in the city or county road fund. The special permit provided for herein shall be known as a "log tolerance permit" and shall designate the route or routes to be used, which shall first be approved by the city or county engineer involved. Authorization of additional route or routes may be made at the discretion of the city or county by amending the original permit or by issuing a new permit. Said permits shall be issued on a yearly basis expiring on March 31st of each calendar year. Any person, firm, or corporation who uses any city street or county road for the purpose of transporting logs with weights authorized by state highway log tolerance permits, to reach or leave a state highway route, without first obtaining a city or county permit when required by the city or the county legislative authority shall be subject to the penalties prescribed by RCW 46.44.105. For the purpose of determining gross weight the actual scale weight taken by the officer shall be prima facie evidence of such total gross weight. In the event the gross weight is in excess of the weight permitted by law, the officer may, within his or her discretion, permit the operator to proceed with his or her vehicles in combination.

The chief of the state patrol, with the advice of the department, may make reasonable rules and regulations to aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this section.

   d. On any group of axles with a wheel base between the first and last axle of not less than ten feet but less than thirty feet, a weight in pounds determined by multiplying two thousand two hundred times the sum of twenty and the distance in feet between the center of the first axle and the center of the last axle of the group;

   e. On any group of axles with a wheel base between the first and last axle of thirty feet or greater, a weight in pounds determined by multiplying one thousand six hundred times the sum of forty and the distance in feet between the center of the first axle and the center of the last axle of the group.

2. The total weight of a vehicle or combination of vehicles allowable by special permit under subsection (1) of this section shall be governed by the lesser of the weights obtained by using the total number of axles as a group or any combination of axles as a group.

3. The weight limitations pertaining to single axles may be exceeded to permit the movement of equipment operating upon single pneumatic tires having a rim width of twenty inches or more and a rim diameter of twenty-four inches or more or dual pneumatic tires having a rim width of sixteen inches or more and a rim diameter of twenty-four inches or more and specially designed vehicles manufactured and certified for special permits prior to July 1, 1975.

## 46.44.0915 - Heavy haul industrial corridors—Overweight sealed containers and vehicles.
1. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, the department of transportation, with respect to state highways maintained within port district property, may, at the request of a port commission, make and enter into agreements with port districts and adjacent jurisdictions or agencies of the districts, for the purpose of identifying, managing, and maintaining short heavy haul industrial corridors within port district property for the movement of overweight sealed containers used in international trade.

   b. The department of transportation shall designate that portion of state route number 97 from the Canadian border to milepost 331.12 as a heavy haul industrial corridor for the movement of overweight vehicles to and from the Oroville railhead. The department may issue special permits to vehicles operating in the heavy haul industrial corridor to carry weight in excess of weight limits established in RCW 46.44.041, but not to exceed a gross vehicle weight of 139,994 pounds.

   c. The department of transportation shall designate that portion of state route number 128 from the Idaho border from milepost .51 to 2.24 and continuing on to state route number 193 from milepost .51 to 2.32 ending at the Port of Wilma as a heavy haul industrial corridor for the movement of overweight vehicles. The department may issue special permits to vehicles operating in the heavy haul industrial corridor to carry weight in excess of weight limits established in RCW 46.44.041, but not to exceed a gross vehicle weight of 129,000 pounds. Such vehicles operating in the heavy haul industrial corridor must comply with the federal bridge gross weight formula in 23 C.F.R. Part 658 as it existed on January 1, 2017, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the department by rule, consistent with the purposes of this subsection (1)(c), with axle and tire size weight limitations established in RCW 46.44.042 and length limitations established in RCW 46.44.030 and 46.44.0941.

2. Except as provided in subsection (1)(b) and (c) of this section, the department may issue special permits to vehicles operating in a heavy haul industrial corridor to carry weight in excess of weight limits established in RCW 46.44.041. However, the excess weight on a single axle, tandem axle, or any axle group must not exceed that allowed by RCW 46.44.091 (1) and (2), weight per tire must not exceed six hundred pounds per inch width of tire, and gross vehicle weight must not exceed one hundred five thousand five hundred pounds.

3. The entity operating or hiring vehicles under subsection (1)(b) of this section or moving overweight sealed containers used in international trade must pay a fee for each special permit of one hundred dollars per month or one thousand dollars annually, beginning from the date of issue, for all movements under the special permit made on state highways within a heavy haul industrial corridor. Within a port district property, under no circumstances are the for hire carriers or rail customers responsible for the purchase or cost of the permits. All funds collected, except the amount retained by authorized agents of the department under RCW 46.44.096, must be forwarded to the state treasurer and deposited in the motor vehicle fund.

4. For purposes of this section, an overweight sealed container used in international trade, including its contents, is considered nondivisible when transported within a heavy haul industrial corridor defined by the department.

5. Any agreement entered into by the department as authorized under this section with a port district adjacent to Puget Sound and located within a county that has a population of more than seven hundred thousand, but less than one million, must limit the applicability of any established heavy haul corridor to that portion of state route no. 509 beginning at milepost 0.25 in the vicinity of East 'D' Street and ending at milepost 5.7 in the vicinity of Norpoint Way Northeast.

6. The department of transportation may adopt reasonable rules to implement this section.

## 46.44.096 - Special permits—Determining fee—To whom paid.
In determining fees according to RCW 46.44.0941, mileage on state primary and secondary highways shall be determined from the planning survey records of the department of transportation, and the gross weight of the vehicle or vehicles, including load, shall be declared by the applicant. Overweight on which fees shall be paid will be gross loadings in excess of loadings authorized by law or axle loadings in excess of loadings authorized by law, whichever is the greater. Loads which are overweight and oversize shall be charged the fee for the overweight permit without additional fees being assessed for the oversize features.

Special permits issued under RCW 46.44.047, 46.44.0941, or 46.44.095, may be obtained from offices of the department of transportation, ports of entry, or other agents appointed by the department.

The department may appoint agents for the purposes of selling special motor vehicle permits, temporary additional tonnage permits, and log tolerance permits. Agents so appointed may retain three dollars and fifty cents for each permit sold to defray expenses incurred in handling and selling the permits. If the fee is collected by the department of transportation, the department shall certify the fee so collected to the state treasurer for deposit to the credit of the motor vehicle fund.

The department may select a third party contractor, by means of competitive bid, to perform the department's permit issuance function, as provided under RCW 46.44.090. Factors the department shall consider, but is not limited to, in the selection of a third party contractor are economic benefit to both the department and the motor carrier industry, and enhancement of the overall level of permit service. For purposes of this section, "third party contractor" means a business entity that is authorized by the department to issue special permits. The department of transportation may adopt rules specifying the criteria that a business entity must meet in order to qualify as a third party contractor under this section.

Fees established in RCW 46.44.0941 shall be paid to the political body issuing the permit if the entire movement is to be confined to roads, streets, or highways for which that political body is responsible. When a movement involves a combination of state highways, county roads, and/or city streets the fee shall be paid to the department of transportation. When a movement is confined within the city limits of a city or town upon city streets, including routes of state highways on city streets, all fees shall be paid to the city or town involved. A permit will not be required from city or town authorities for a move involving a combination of city or town streets and state highways when the move through a city or town is being confined to the route of the state highway. When a move involves a combination of county roads and city streets the fee shall be paid to the county authorities, but the fee shall not be collected nor the county permit issued until valid permits are presented showing that the city or town authorities approve of the move in question. When the movement involves only county roads the fees collected shall be paid to the county involved. Fees established shall be paid to the political body issuing the permit if the entire use of the vehicle during the period covered by the permit shall be confined to the roads, streets, or highways for which that political body is responsible.

Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a traffic infraction, and upon the first finding thereof shall be assessed a basic penalty of not less than fifty dollars; and upon a second finding thereof shall be assessed a basic penalty of not less than seventy-five dollars; and upon a third or subsequent finding shall be assessed a basic penalty of not less than one hundred dollars.

   b. [Empty]

      i. Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, in addition to the penalties imposed in (a) of this subsection, any person violating RCW 46.44.041, 46.44.042, 46.44.047, 46.44.090, 46.44.091, or 46.44.095 shall be assessed a penalty for each pound overweight, as follows:

         A.  One pound through four thousand pounds overweight is three cents for each pound;

         B.  Four thousand one pounds through ten thousand pounds overweight is one hundred twenty dollars plus twelve cents per pound for each additional pound over four thousand pounds overweight;

         C.  Ten thousand one pounds through fifteen thousand pounds overweight is eight hundred forty dollars plus sixteen cents per pound for each additional pound over ten thousand pounds overweight;

         D.  Fifteen thousand one pounds through twenty thousand pounds overweight is one thousand six hundred forty dollars plus twenty cents per pound for each additional pound over fifteen thousand pounds overweight;

         E.  Twenty thousand one pounds and more is two thousand six hundred forty dollars plus thirty cents per pound for each additional pound over twenty thousand pounds overweight.

      ii. Upon a first violation in any calendar year, the court may suspend the penalty for five hundred pounds of excess weight for each axle on any vehicle or combination of vehicles, not to exceed a two thousand pound suspension. Except as specified in (c) of this subsection, in no case may the basic penalty assessed in (a) of this subsection or the additional penalty assessed in (b) of this subsection, except as provided for the first violation, be suspended.

   c. [Empty]

      i. The penalties in (a) and (b) of this subsection are not applicable and a written warning must be issued when a traffic infraction for a violation of RCW 46.44.041 occurs and the following applies:

         A.  A vehicle or combination of vehicles carrying farm products, as defined in RCW 7.48.310, from the field where the farm product was grown or harvested, exceeds the gross vehicle weight limits in RCW 46.44.041 by five percent or less; and

         B.  The driver of the vehicle has not been issued a traffic infraction or has received no more than one written warning for a violation of RCW 46.44.041 within the calendar year in which the violation occurs.

      ii. The state patrol must track the issuance of written warnings issued for RCW 46.44.041 for the purposes of determining whether a violation of RCW 46.44.041 is the first in a calendar year.

2. Any person found to have violated any posted limitations of a highway or section of highway shall be assessed a monetary penalty of not less than one hundred fifty dollars, and the court shall in addition thereto upon second violation within a twelve-month period involving the same power unit, suspend the certificate of license registration for not less than thirty days.

3. It is unlawful for the driver of a vehicle to fail or refuse to stop and submit the vehicle and load to a weighing, or to fail or refuse, when directed by an officer upon a weighing of the vehicle to stop the vehicle and otherwise comply with the provisions of this section. It is unlawful for a driver of a commercial motor vehicle as defined in RCW 46.32.005, other than the driver of a bus as defined in RCW 46.32.005(3) or a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross combination weight rating of 7,257 kilograms or less (16,000 pounds or less) and not transporting hazardous materials in accordance with RCW 46.32.005(4), to fail or refuse to stop at a weighing station when proper traffic control signs indicate scales are open. However, unladen tow trucks regardless of weight and farm vehicles carrying farm produce with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross combination weight rating of 11,794 kilograms or less (26,000 pounds or less) may fail or refuse to stop at a weighing station when proper traffic control signs indicate scales are open.

Any police officer is authorized to require the driver of any vehicle or combination of vehicles to stop and submit to a weighing either by means of a portable or stationary scale and may require that the vehicle be driven to the nearest public scale. Whenever a police officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the weight is unlawful, the officer may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable location and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as may be necessary to reduce the gross weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted by law. If the vehicle is loaded with grain or other perishable commodities, the driver shall be permitted to proceed without removing any of the load, unless the gross weight of the vehicle and load exceeds by more than ten percent the limit permitted by this chapter. The owner or operator of the vehicle shall care for all materials unloaded at the risk of the owner or operator.

Any vehicle whose driver or owner represents that the vehicle is disabled or otherwise unable to proceed to a weighing location shall have its load sealed or otherwise marked by any police officer. The owner or driver shall be directed that upon completion of repairs, the vehicle shall submit to weighing with the load and markings and/or seal intact and undisturbed. Failure to report for weighing, appearing for weighing with the seal broken or the markings disturbed, or removal of any cargo prior to weighing is unlawful. Any person so convicted shall be fined one thousand dollars, and in addition the certificate of license registration shall be suspended for not less than thirty days.

4. Any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, district courts having venue have concurrent jurisdiction with the superior courts for the imposition of any penalties authorized under this section.

5. For the purpose of determining additional penalties as provided by subsection (1)(b) of this section, "overweight" means the poundage in excess of the maximum allowable gross weight or axle/axle grouping weight prescribed by RCW 46.44.041, 46.44.042, 46.44.047, 46.44.091, and 46.44.095.

6. The penalties provided in subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section shall be remitted as provided in chapter 3.62 RCW or RCW 10.82.070. For the purpose of computing the basic penalties and additional penalties to be imposed under subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section, the convictions shall be on the same vehicle or combination of vehicles within a twelve-month period under the same ownership.

7. Any state patrol officer or any weight control officer who finds any person operating a vehicle or a combination of vehicles in violation of the conditions of a permit issued under RCW 46.44.047, 46.44.090, and 46.44.095 may confiscate the permit and forward it to the state department of transportation which may return it to the permittee or revoke, cancel, or suspend it without refund. The department of transportation shall keep a record of all action taken upon permits so confiscated, and if a permit is returned to the permittee the action taken by the department of transportation shall be endorsed thereon. Any permittee whose permit is suspended or revoked may upon request receive a hearing before the department of transportation or person designated by that department. After the hearing the department of transportation may reinstate any permit or revise its previous action.

Every permit issued as provided for in this chapter shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any law enforcement officer or authorized agent of any authority granting such a permit.

Upon the third finding within a calendar year of a violation of the requirements and conditions of a permit issued under RCW 46.44.095, the permit shall be canceled, and the canceled permit shall be immediately transmitted by the court or the arresting officer to the department of transportation. The vehicle covered by the canceled permit is not eligible for a new permit for a period of thirty days.

8. For the purposes of determining gross weights the actual scale weight taken by the arresting officer is prima facie evidence of the total gross weight.
