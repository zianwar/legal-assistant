## 46.18.005 - Intent.
The legislature has seen an increase in the demand from constituent groups seeking recognition and funding through the establishment of commemorative or special license plates. The high cost of implementing a new special license plate series coupled with the uncertainty of the state's ability to recoup its costs has led the legislature to delay the implementation of new special license plates. In order to address these issues, it is the intent of the legislature to create a mechanism that will allow for the evaluation of special license plate requests and establish a funding policy that will alleviate the financial burden currently placed on the state. Using these two strategies, the legislature will be better equipped to efficiently process special license plate legislation.

## 46.18.130 - Disposition of revenues.
1. Revenues generated from the sale of special license plates for those sponsoring organizations who used the application process in RCW 46.18.110 must be deposited into the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070 until the department determines that the state's implementation costs have been fully reimbursed.

2. When it is determined that the state has been fully reimbursed the department must notify the house of representatives and senate transportation committees, the sponsoring organization, and the state treasurer, and begin distributing the revenue as otherwise provided by law.

3. If reimbursement does not occur within two years from the date the special license plate is first offered for sale to the public, the special license plate series must be placed in probationary status for a period of one year from that date. If the state is still not fully reimbursed for its implementation costs after the one-year probation, the special license plate series must be discontinued immediately. Special license plates issued before discontinuation are valid until replaced.

4. The department shall:

   a. Provide the special license plate applicant with a written receipt for the payment; and

   b. Maintain a record of each special license plate applicant trust account deposit including, but not limited to, the name and address of each special license plate applicant whose funds are being deposited, the amount paid, and the date of the deposit.

## 46.18.140 - Nonreviewed special license plates.
1. A special license plate series created by the legislature after January 1, 2011, that has not been reviewed and approved by the department is subject to the following requirements:

   a. The organization sponsoring the license plate series shall, within thirty days of enactment of the legislation creating the special license plate series, submit prepayment of all start-up costs associated with the creation and implementation of the special license plate in an amount determined by the department. The prepayment will be credited to the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070. The creation and implementation of the special license plate series may not begin until payment is received by the department.

   b. If the sponsoring organization is not able to meet the prepayment requirements in (a) of this subsection and can demonstrate this fact to the satisfaction of the department, the revenues generated from the sale of the special license plates must be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070 until the department determines that the state's portion of the implementation costs have been fully reimbursed. When it has determined that the state has been fully reimbursed, the department must notify the treasurer to commence distribution of the revenue according to statutory provisions.

   c. The sponsoring organization must provide a proposed special license plate design to the department within thirty days of enactment of the legislation creating the special license plate series.

2. The state must be reimbursed for its portion of the implementation costs within two years from the date the new special license plate series goes on sale to the public. If the reimbursement does not occur within the two-year time frame, the special license plate series must be placed in probationary status for a period of one year from that date. If the state is still not fully reimbursed for its implementation costs after the one-year probation, the special license plate series must be discontinued immediately. Those special license plates issued before discontinuation are valid until replaced.
