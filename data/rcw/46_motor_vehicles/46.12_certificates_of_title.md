## 46.12.520 - Certificate required to operate and sell vehicle—Manufacturer or dealer testing—Security interest, how perfected.
1. A person shall not:

   a. Operate a vehicle in this state with a registration certificate issued by the department without having a certificate of title for the vehicle that contains the name of the registered owner exactly as it appears on the registration certificate; or

   b. Sell or transfer a vehicle without complying with the provisions of this chapter relating to certificates of title and vehicle registration.

2. A certificate of title does not need to be obtained for a vehicle owned by a manufacturer or dealer and held for sale, even though incidentally moved on the highway or used for purposes of testing and demonstration, or for a vehicle used by a manufacturer or dealer solely for testing. A security interest in a vehicle held as inventory by a manufacturer or dealer must be perfected as described in chapter 62A.9A RCW. An endorsement is not required on certificates of title held by a manufacturer or dealer to perfect the security interest. A certificate of title may be issued for any vehicle without the vehicle needing to be registered.

   a. The security interest continues perfected in this state if the name of the secured party is shown on the existing certificate of title issued by that jurisdiction. The name of the secured party must be shown on the certificate of title issued for the vehicle by this state. The security interest continues perfected in this state when the department issues the certificate of title.

   b. If the security interest was not perfected under the law of the jurisdiction where the vehicle was when the security interest was attached, it may be perfected in this state. Perfection begins when the department receives the information and fees required in subsection (1) of this section.

   a. Assign the certificate of title to the registered owner or the registered owner's designee and send the certificate of title to the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director with the fee required in RCW 46.17.100; or

   b. Assign the certificate of title to the person acquiring the vehicle from the registered owner with the registered owner's release of interest.

6. The department shall issue a new certificate of title to the registered owner when the department receives the release of interest and required fees as provided in subsection (5)(a) of this section.

7. A secured party is liable for one hundred dollars payable to the registered owner or person acquiring the vehicle from the registered owner when:

   a. The secured party fails to either assign the certificate of title to the registered owner or to the person acquiring the vehicle from the registered owner or apply for a new certificate of title within ten days after proper demand; and
