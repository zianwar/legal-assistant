## 46.72A.010 - Finding and intent.
The legislature finds and declares that privately operated limousine transportation service is a vital part of the transportation system within the state and provides prearranged transportation services to state residents, tourists, and out-of-state business people. Consequently, the safety, reliability, and stability of privately operated limousine transportation services are matters of statewide importance. The regulation of privately operated limousine transportation services is thus an essential governmental function. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to permit the department and a port district in a county with a population of one million or more to regulate limousine transportation services without liability under federal antitrust laws. It is further the intent of the legislature to authorize a city with a population of five hundred thousand or more to enforce this chapter through a joint agreement with the department, and to direct the department to provide annual funding from limousine regulation-related fees that provide sufficient funds to such a city to provide delegated enforcement.

## 46.72A.020 - Engagement of and fares for carrier services—Service records—Carrier information—Penalties—Rules.
1. Contact by a customer or customer's agent to engage the services of a carrier's limousine must be initiated by a customer or customer's agent at a time and place different from the customer's time and place of departure. The fare for service must be agreed upon prior to departure. Under no circumstances may customers or customers' agents make arrangements to immediately engage the services of a carrier's limousine with the chauffeur, even if the chauffeur is an owner or officer of the company, with the single exception of stand-hail limousines only at a facility owned and operated by a port district in a county with a population of one million or more that are licensed and restricted by the rules and policies set forth by the port district.

2. At the time of the conduct of the commercial limousine business, the chauffeur of a limousine and the limousine carrier business must possess written or electronic records substantiating the prearrangement of the carrier's services for any customer carried for compensation, except for vehicles meeting the requirements of the exception for stand-hail limousines described in subsection (1) of this section. Limousine carriers and limousine chauffeurs operating as an independent business must list a physical address on their business license issued under chapter 19.02 RCW where records substantiating the prearrangement of the carrier's services may be reviewed by an enforcement officer. A limousine carrier must retain these records for a minimum of one calendar year, and failure to do so is a class 3 civil infraction against the carrier for each record that is missing or fails to include all of the information described in rules adopted under subsection (4) of this section.

3. Limousine carriers and limousine chauffeurs operating as an independent business must list a telephone or pager number that is used to prearrange the carrier's services for any customer carried for compensation.

4. The department must adopt rules specifying the content and retention schedule of the records required for compliance with subsection (2) of this section.

5. The failure of a chauffeur who is operating a limousine to immediately provide, on demand by an enforcement officer, written or electronic records required by the department substantiating the prearrangement of the carrier's services for any customer carried for compensation, except for limousines meeting the requirements of the exception for stand-hail limousines described in subsection (1) of this section, is a class 2 civil infraction and is subject to monetary penalties under RCW 7.80.120. It is a class 1 civil infraction for a repeat offense under this subsection during the same calendar year.

6. The department must define by rule conditions under which a chauffeur is considered to be operating a limousine, including when the limousine is parked in a designated passenger load zone.

## 46.72A.030 - Regulation—Inspection—Fees—Penalties.
1. The department, in conjunction with the Washington state patrol, shall regulate limousine carriers with respect to entry, safety of equipment, chauffeur qualifications, and operations. The department shall adopt rules and require such reports as are necessary to carry out this chapter. The department may develop penalties for failure to comply with this section.

2. In addition, a port district in a county with a population of one million or more may regulate limousine carriers with respect to entry, safety of equipment, chauffeur qualifications, and operations. The county in which the port district is located may adopt ordinances and rules to assist the port district in enforcement of limousine regulations only at port facilities. In no event may this be construed to grant the county the authority to regulate limousines within its jurisdiction. The port district may not set limousine rates, but the limousine carriers shall file their rates and schedules with the port district if requested.

3. The department, a port district in a county with a population of at least one million, or a county in which the port district is located may enter into cooperative agreements for the joint regulation of limousines.

4. The department and a city with a population of five hundred thousand or more may enter into cooperative agreements as provided in RCW 46.72A.150, subject to the limitations set forth in RCW 46.72A.130.

5. The Washington state patrol shall annually conduct a vehicle inspection of each limousine licensed under this chapter, except when a port district, or a city with a population of five hundred thousand or more, enforces limousine carrier regulations under subsection (2) or (4) of this section, that port district or county in which the port district is located, or a city with a population of five hundred thousand or more, may conduct the annual limousine vehicle inspection and random limousine vehicle inspections in conjunction with limousine regulation enforcement activities, provided that the inspection criteria and fees are substantially the same regardless of the authority conducting the inspection. Random limousine vehicle inspections may not be conducted while the limousine contains customers. The state patrol, the city, or the port district conducting the annual limousine vehicle inspection may impose an annual vehicle inspection fee and reinspection fee. A carrier must pay a reinspection fee if a limousine fails inspection for compliance with vehicle standards and is reinspected. If the limousine passes the first reinspection within thirty days of failing the original inspection, all of the reinspection fee must be refunded to the carrier. However, refunds are not available for subsequent reinspections. While a limousine is licensed by the department for commercial limousine use, failure to comply with vehicle inspection standards, established by the department by rule, is a class 3 civil infraction against the carrier, with monetary penalties against the carrier as specified in RCW 7.80.120, for each violation of a safety requirement. It is a class 4 civil infraction for each violation of other vehicle standards, with monetary penalties against the carrier as specified in RCW 7.80.120, and the limousine vehicle certificate must be summarily suspended until safety violations of vehicle standards are corrected and the limousine is reinspected.
