3. The law enforcement officer requesting the test under subsection (1) of this section shall warn the person requested to submit to the test that a refusal to submit will result in that person being disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle under RCW 46.25.090.

4. A law enforcement officer who at the time of stopping or detaining a commercial motor vehicle driver has reasonable grounds to believe that driver was driving a commercial motor vehicle while having alcohol, cannabis, or any drug in his or her system or while under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, or any drug may obtain a blood test pursuant to a search warrant, a valid waiver of the warrant requirement, when exigent circumstances exist, or under any other authority of law.

5. If the person refuses testing, or a test is administered that discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or more or any measurable amount of THC concentration, the law enforcement officer shall submit a sworn report to the department certifying that the test was requested pursuant to subsection (1) of this section or a blood test was administered pursuant to subsection (4) of this section and that the person refused to submit to testing, or a test was administered that disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or more or any measurable amount of THC concentration.

For the purposes of this section, the hearing shall cover the issues of whether a law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle within this state while having alcohol in the person's system or while under the influence of any drug, whether the person refused to submit to the test or tests upon request of the officer after having been informed that the refusal would result in the disqualification of the person from driving a commercial motor vehicle, if applicable, and, if the test was administered, whether the results indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent or more or any measurable amount of THC concentration. The department shall order that the disqualification of the person either be rescinded or sustained. Any decision by the department disqualifying a person from driving a commercial motor vehicle is stayed and does not take effect while a formal hearing is pending under this section or during the pendency of a subsequent appeal to superior court so long as there is no conviction for a moving violation or no finding that the person has committed a traffic infraction that is a moving violation during the pendency of the hearing and appeal. If the disqualification of the person is sustained after the hearing, the person who is disqualified may file a petition in the superior court of the county of arrest to review the final order of disqualification by the department in the manner provided in RCW 46.20.334.

7.

If the employer is required to have a testing program under 49 C.F.R. 655, a report of a verified positive drug test or positive alcohol confirmation test must not be forwarded to the department under this subsection unless the test is a preemployment drug test conducted under 49 C.F.R. 655.41 or a preemployment alcohol test conducted under 49 C.F.R. 655.42.

   a. A motor carrier or employer who employs drivers who operate commercial motor vehicles and who is required to have a testing program conducted under the procedures established by 49 C.F.R. 40, or the consortium the carrier or employer belongs to, must report a refusal by a commercial motor vehicle driver to take a drug or alcohol test, under circumstances that constitute the refusal of a test under 49 C.F.R. 40 and where such refusal has not been reported by a medical review officer or breath alcohol technician, to the department of licensing on a form provided by the department.

   b. An employer who is required to have a testing program under 49 C.F.R. 655 must report a commercial motor vehicle driver's verified positive drug test or a positive alcohol confirmation test when: (i) The driver's employment has been terminated or the driver has resigned; (ii) any grievance process, up to but not including arbitration, has been concluded; and (iii) at the time of termination or resignation the driver has not been cleared to return to safety-sensitive functions.

3. Motor carriers, employers, or consortiums shall make it a written condition of their contract or agreement with a medical review officer or breath alcohol technician, regardless of the state where the medical review officer or breath alcohol technician is located, that the medical review officer or breath alcohol technician is required to report all Washington state licensed drivers who have a verified positive drug test or positive alcohol confirmation test to the department of licensing within three business days of the verification or confirmation. Failure to obtain this contractual condition or agreement with the medical review officer or breath alcohol technician by the motor carrier, employer, or consortium, or failure to report a refusal as required by subsection (2) of this section, will result in an administrative fine as provided in RCW 46.32.100 or 81.04.405.

## 46.25.125 - Disqualification for positive test—Procedure.
1. When the department of licensing receives a report from a medical review officer, breath alcohol technician, employer, contractor, or consortium that a driver has a verified positive drug test or positive alcohol confirmation test, as part of the testing program conducted under 49 C.F.R. 40, the department shall disqualify the driver from driving a commercial motor vehicle under RCW 46.25.090(7) subject to a hearing as provided in this section. The department shall notify the person in writing of the disqualification by first-class mail. The notice must explain the procedure for the person to request a hearing.

2. A person disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehicle for having a verified positive drug test or positive alcohol confirmation test may request a hearing to challenge the disqualification within twenty days from the date notice is given. If the request for a hearing is mailed, it must be postmarked within twenty days after the department has given notice of the disqualification.

3. The hearing must be conducted in the county of the person's residence, except that the department may conduct all or part of the hearing by telephone or other electronic means.

4. For the purposes of this section, or for the purpose of a hearing de novo in an appeal to superior court, the hearing must be limited to the following issues: (a) Whether the driver is the person who is the subject of the report; (b) whether the motor carrier, employer, or consortium has a program that is subject to the federal requirements under 49 C.F.R. 40; and (c) whether the medical review officer or breath alcohol technician making the report accurately followed the protocols established to verify or confirm the results, or if the driver refused a test, whether the circumstances constitute the refusal of a test under 49 C.F.R. 40. Evidence may be presented to demonstrate that the test results are a false positive. For the purpose of a hearing under this section, a copy of a positive test result with a declaration by the tester or medical review officer or breath alcohol technician stating the accuracy of the laboratory protocols followed to arrive at the test result is prima facie evidence:

   i. Of a verified positive drug test or positive alcohol confirmation test result;

      ii. That the motor carrier, employer, or consortium has a program that is subject to the federal requirements under 49 C.F.R. 40; and

      iii. That the medical review officer or breath alcohol technician making the report accurately followed the protocols for testing established to verify or confirm the results.

After the hearing, the department shall order the disqualification of the person either be rescinded or sustained.

5. If the person does not request a hearing within the twenty-day time limit, or if the person fails to appear at a hearing, the person has waived the right to a hearing and the department shall sustain the disqualification.

6. A decision by the department disqualifying a person from driving a commercial motor vehicle is stayed and does not take effect while a formal hearing is pending under this section or during the pendency of a subsequent appeal to superior court so long as there is no conviction for a moving violation or no finding that the person has committed a traffic infraction that is a moving violation and the department receives no further report of a verified positive drug test or positive alcohol confirmation test during the pendency of the hearing and appeal. If the disqualification is sustained after the hearing, the person who is disqualified may file a petition in the superior court of the county of his or her residence to review the final order of disqualification by the department in the manner provided in RCW 46.20.334.

7. The department of licensing may adopt rules specifying further requirements for requesting and conducting a hearing under this section.

8. The department of licensing is not civilly liable for damage resulting from disqualifying a driver based on a verified positive drug test or positive alcohol confirmation test result as required by this section or for damage resulting from release of this information that occurs in the normal course of business.
