## 46.87.020 - Definitions.
Provisions and terms used in this chapter have the meaning given to them in the international registration plan (IRP), in chapter 46.04 RCW, or as otherwise defined in this section. Definitions given to terms by the IRP prevail unless given a different meaning in this chapter or in rules adopted under authority of this chapter.

1. "Adequate records" are records maintained by the owner of the fleet sufficient to enable the department to verify the distances reported in the owner's application for apportioned registration and to evaluate the accuracy of the owner's distance accounting system.

2. "Apportionable vehicle" has the meaning given by the IRP, except that it does not include vehicles with a declared gross weight of twelve thousand pounds or less.

3. "Cab card" is a certificate of registration issued for a vehicle.

4. "Credentials" means cab cards, apportioned plates, temporary operating authority, and validation tabs issued for proportionally registered vehicles.

5. "Declared combined gross weight" means the total unladen weight of any combination of vehicles plus the maximum weight of the load to be carried on the combination of vehicles as declared by the registrant.

6. "Declared gross weight" means the total unladen weight of any vehicle plus the maximum weight of the load to be carried on the vehicle as declared by the registrant. In the case of a bus, auto stage, or a passenger-carrying for hire vehicle with a seating capacity of more than six, the declared gross weight is determined by multiplying one hundred fifty pounds by the number of seats in the vehicle, including the driver's seat, and adding this amount to the unladen weight of the vehicle. If the resultant gross weight is not listed in RCW 46.17.355, it must be increased to the next higher gross weight authorized in chapter 46.44 RCW.

7. "Department" means the department of licensing.

8. "Fleet" means one or more apportionable vehicles.

9. "In-jurisdiction distance" means the total distance, in miles, accumulated in a jurisdiction during the reporting period by vehicles of the fleet while they were a part of the fleet.

10. "IRP" means the international registration plan.

11. "Jurisdiction" means and includes a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a foreign country, and a state or province of a foreign country.

12. "Motor carrier" means an entity engaged in the transportation of goods or persons. "Motor carrier" includes a for-hire motor carrier, private motor carrier, exempt motor carrier, registrant licensed under this chapter, motor vehicle lessor, and motor vehicle lessee.

13. "Owner" means a person or business who holds the legal title to a vehicle, or if a vehicle is the subject of an agreement for its conditional sale with the right of purchase upon performance of the conditions stated in the agreement and with an immediate right of possession vested in the conditional vendee, or if a vehicle is subject to a lease, contract, or other legal arrangement vesting right of possession or control, for security or otherwise, or if a mortgagor of a vehicle is entitled to possession, then the owner is deemed to be the person or business in whom is vested right of possession or control.

13. [(14)] "Person" means any individual, partnership, association, public or private corporation, limited liability company, or other type of legal or commercial entity, including its members, managers, partners, directors, or officers.

14. [(15)] "Prorate percentage" is the factor applied to the total proratable fees and taxes to determine the apportionable fees required for registration in a jurisdiction. It is determined by dividing the in-jurisdiction distance for a particular jurisdiction by the total distance.

15. [(16)] "Registrant" means a person, business, or corporation in whose name or names a vehicle or fleet of vehicles is registered.

16. [(17)] "Registration year" means the twelve-month period during which the credentials issued by the base jurisdiction are valid.

17. [(18)] "Reporting period" means the period of twelve consecutive months immediately prior to July 1st of the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the registration year for which apportioned registration is sought. If the fleet registration period commences in October, November, or December, the reporting period is the period of twelve consecutive months immediately preceding July 1st of the current calendar year.

18. [(19)] "Total distance" means all distance operated by a fleet of apportioned vehicles. "Total distance" includes the full distance traveled in all vehicle movements, both interjurisdictional and intrajurisdictional, including loaded, unladen, deadhead, and bobtail distances. Distance traveled by a vehicle while under a trip lease is considered to have been traveled by the lessor's fleet. All distance, both interstate and intrastate, accumulated by vehicles of the fleet is included in the fleet distance.

## 46.87.022 - Rental trailers—Fleet vehicle registration.
Owners of rental trailers and semitrailers over six thousand pounds gross vehicle weight used solely in pool fleets must fully register a portion of the pool fleet in this state. To determine the percentage of total fleet vehicles that must be registered in this state, divide the gross revenue received in the reporting period for the use of the rental vehicles arising from rental transactions occurring in this state by the total revenue received in the reporting period for the use of the rental vehicles arising from rental transactions in all jurisdictions in which the vehicles are operated. Apply the resulting percentage to the total number of vehicles that must be registered in this state. Vehicles registered in this state must be representative of the vehicles in the fleet according to age, size, and value.

\[ [2015 c 228 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5297.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20228%20§%203); [1990 c 250 § 74](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c250.pdf?cite=1990%20c%20250%20§%2074); \]

## 46.87.025 - Vehicles titled in owner's name.
All vehicles being added to a Washington fleet or those vehicles that make up a new Washington fleet must be titled in the name of the owner at time of registration.

\[ [2015 c 228 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5297.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20228%20§%204); [1990 c 250 § 75](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c250.pdf?cite=1990%20c%20250%20§%2075); [1987 c 244 § 17](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c244.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20244%20§%2017); \]

## 46.87.030 - Part-year registration—Credit for unused fees.
1. When application to register a vehicle in an existing fleet is made, the Washington apportioned fees must be reduced by one-twelfth for each full month that has elapsed from the time an application for registration is received in the department. The prorate percentage previously established for the fleet must be used in the computation of the apportionable fees and taxes due.

2. If a vehicle is withdrawn from a fleet during the period it is registered under this chapter, the registrant of the fleet must notify the department on forms prescribed by the department. The department may require the registrant to surrender credentials issued to the vehicle. If a vehicle is completely removed from the service of the fleet, the unused portion of the license fee paid under RCW 46.17.355, reduced by one-twelfth for each month and fraction thereof elapsing between the first day of the month of the current registration year and the date the notice of removal is received in the department, must be credited to the registrant's fleet proportional registration account. Credit must be applied against the license fee liability for subsequent additions of vehicles to the fleet during the registration year or for additional license fees due under RCW 46.17.355 or be due upon audit under RCW 46.87.310. If any credit is less than fifteen dollars, the credit must not be entered. In lieu of credit, the registrant may transfer the unused portion of the license fee for the vehicle to the new owner, in which case it must remain with the vehicle for which it was originally paid. An amount may not be credited against fees other than those for the registration year from which the credit was obtained and an amount may not be refunded.

\[ [2015 c 228 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5297.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20228%20§%205); [2010 c 161 § 1142](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6379.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20161%20§%201142); [2005 c 194 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1259.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20194%20§%203); [1997 c 183 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1459.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20183%20§%203); [1993 c 307 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1379.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20307%20§%2013); [1987 c 244 § 18](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c244.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20244%20§%2018); [1986 c 18 § 23](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c18.pdf?cite=1986%20c%2018%20§%2023); [1985 c 380 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c380.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20380%20§%203); \]

## 46.87.040 - Purchase of additional gross weight.
Additional gross weight may be purchased to the limits authorized under chapter 46.44 RCW. Registration must be for the remainder of the registration year, including the full registration month in which the vehicle is initially registered at the higher gross weight. The apportionable fee initially paid to the state of Washington, reduced by the number of full registration months the license was in effect, must be deducted from the total fee due. A credit or refund may not be given for a reduction of gross weight.

## 46.87.050 - Deposit of fees.
Each day the department must forward to the state treasurer the fees collected under this chapter and, within ten days of the end of each registration quarter, a detailed report identifying the amount to be deposited to each account for which fees are required. Such fees must be deposited pursuant to RCW 46.68.035.

\[ [2015 c 228 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5297.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20228%20§%207); [2005 c 194 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1259.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20194%20§%204); [1987 c 244 § 20](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c244.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20244%20§%2020); [1985 c 380 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1985c380.pdf?cite=1985%20c%20380%20§%205); \]

## 46.87.070 - Reciprocity for trailers, semitrailers, pole trailers.
Trailers, semitrailers, and pole trailers properly based in jurisdictions other than Washington and displaying currently registered license plates issued by the jurisdictions are granted vehicle registration reciprocity in this state. Unless registered under the provisions of the IRP as a pool fleet, such trailers, semitrailers, and pole trailers must be operated in combination with an apportioned power unit to qualify for reciprocity. If pole trailers are not required to be licensed separately by a member jurisdiction, they may be operated in this state without displaying a base license plate.

## 46.87.140 - Application—Filing, contents—Fees and taxes—Assessments, due date.
1. Any owner of one or more fleets of apportionable vehicles may, in lieu of registration of the vehicles under chapter 46.16A RCW, register the vehicles of each fleet by filing a proportional registration application with the department. The application must contain the following information and other information the department may require:

   a. A description and identification of each vehicle in the fleet.

   b. An original or renewal application must be accompanied by a distance schedule for each fleet.

   c. The USDOT number issued to the registrant and the USDOT number of the motor carrier responsible for the safety of each vehicle, if different.

   d. The taxpayer identification number of the registrant and the motor carrier responsible for the safety of each vehicle, if different.

2. Each application must, at the time and in the manner required by the department, be supported by payment of a fee computed as follows:

   a. Divide the in-jurisdiction distance for each jurisdiction by the total distance and carry the answer to the nearest thousandth of a percent (three places beyond the decimal, e.g. 10.543 percent). This factor is known as the prorate percentage.

   b. Determine the apportionable fees and taxes required for each vehicle in the fleet based on the applicable fees and taxes under the laws of each jurisdiction.

Fees and taxes for vehicles of Washington fleets and foreign jurisdiction fleets operating in Washington are those prescribed under RCW 46.17.315, 46.17.355, and 82.38.075. If, during the registration period, the lessor of an apportioned vehicle changes and the vehicle remains in the fleet of the registrant, the department must only charge those fees prescribed for the issuance of new apportioned license plates, validation tabs, and cab card.

   c. Multiply the total, apportionable fees or taxes for each vehicle by the prorate percentage applicable to each jurisdiction and round the results to the nearest cent.

   d. Add the total fees and taxes determined in (c) of this subsection for each vehicle to the nonapportionable fees and taxes required under the laws of each jurisdiction. Nonapportionable fees required for vehicles of Washington fleets are the administrative fee required under RCW 82.38.075, the vehicle transaction fee pursuant to RCW 46.87.130, and the commercial vehicle safety inspection [enforcement] fee in RCW 46.17.315.

   e. The amount due and payable is the sum of the fees and taxes calculated for each jurisdiction in which the fleet is registered.

3. All assessments for taxes and fees are due and payable in United States funds on the date presented or mailed to the registrant at the address listed in the proportional registration records of the department. The registrant may petition for reassessment of the fees or taxes due within thirty days of the date of original service.

The owner must make records available to the department for audit as to the accuracy and adequacy of records, computations, and payments at a location designated by the department. The department must assess and collect any unpaid fees and taxes due affected jurisdictions and provide credits for any overpayments of apportionable fees and taxes to the jurisdictions affected. If the records produced by the owner for the audit fail to meet the criteria for adequate records, or are not produced within thirty calendar days after a written request by the department, the department must impose on the owner an assessment in the amount of twenty percent of the total apportionable fees paid or found due because of appropriate adjustment for the registration of the fleet in the registration year to which records pertain. In the instance of a second offense, the department must impose upon the owner an assessment in the amount of fifty percent of the total apportionable fees paid or found due because of appropriate adjustment for the registration of the fleet in the registration year to which records pertain. In the instance of a third or any subsequent offense, the department must impose upon the owner an assessment in the amount of one hundred percent of the total apportionable fees paid or found due because of appropriate adjustment for the registration of the fleet in the registration year to which records pertain. The department must distribute the amount of assessments it collects under this section on a pro rata basis to the other jurisdictions in which the fleet was registered or required to be registered.

If the owner fails to maintain complete records as required under this section, the department may attempt to reconstruct or reestablish such records.

The department may conduct joint audits of any owner with other jurisdictions. An assessment for deficiency or claim for credit may not be made for any period for which records are no longer required. Any fees, taxes, penalties, or interest due and owing the state upon audit bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the first day of the calendar month after the amount should have been paid until the date of payment. If the audit discloses a deliberate and willful intent to evade the requirements of payment under RCW 46.87.140, a penalty of ten percent of the amount owed, in addition to any other assessments authorized under this chapter, must be assessed.

If the audit discloses that an overpayment in excess of ten dollars has been made, the department must refund the overpayment to the owner. Overpayments must bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum from the date on which the overpayment was incurred until the date of payment.

If a petition for reassessment is filed within the thirty-day period, the department must reconsider the assessment and, if the petitioner has requested in the petition, grant the petitioner an oral hearing and give the petitioner ten days notice of the time and place of the hearing. The department may continue the hearing from time to time. The decision of the department upon a petition for reassessment becomes final thirty days after service upon the petitioner of notice of the decision.

Any notice of assessment, reassessment, oral hearing, or decision required under this section must be served personally or by mail. If served by mail, service is deemed to have been accomplished on the date the notice was deposited in the United States mail and mailed to the owner's address as it appears in the proportional registration records of the department.
