## 46.16A.025 - Adjustment of vehicle registration periods to stagger renewal periods.
The department may by rule extend or reduce vehicle registration periods for the purpose of staggering renewal periods.

It is the intent of the legislature that there shall be neither a significant net gain nor loss of revenue to the state general fund or the motor vehicle fund as the result of implementing and maintaining a staggered vehicle registration system.

## 46.16A.455 - Trucks, buses, and for hire vehicles based on gross weight.
1. Auto stage, bus, for hire vehicle - more than six seats. The declared gross weight for an auto stage, bus, or for hire vehicle, except taxicabs, with a seating capacity of more than six is determined by:

   a. Multiplying the number of seats, including the driver, times one hundred fifty pounds per seat;

   b. Adding the scale weight to the product derived in (a) of this subsection; and

   c. Locating the sum derived in (b) of this subsection in the registration fee based on declared gross weight table provided in RCW 46.17.355 and rounding up to the next greater weight.

2. Motor truck, road tractor, truck, truck tractor - sufficient declared gross weight required. The declared gross weight for a motor truck, road tractor, truck, or truck tractor must have a sufficient declared gross weight, as required under chapter 46.44 RCW, to cover:

   a. Its empty scale weight plus the maximum load it will carry; and

   b. The empty scale weight of any trailer it will tow and the maximum load that the trailer will carry. The declared gross weight of the motor vehicle does not need to include the trailer if:

      i. The empty scale weight of the trailer and the maximum load the trailer will carry does not exceed four thousand pounds; or

      ii. The trailer is for personal use, such as a horse trailer, travel trailer, or utility trailer.

   a. The amount would exceed the legal limits described in RCW 46.44.041 or 46.44.042, in which event the vehicle must be licensed for the maximum weight authorized for the vehicle; or

   b. The vehicle is a fixed load vehicle.

4. Increasing declared gross weight. The following provisions apply when increasing declared gross weight for a motor vehicle licensed under this section:

   a. The declared gross weight must be increased to the end of the current registration year when the declared gross weight remains at 12,000 pounds or less.

   b. For motor vehicles increasing to a declared gross weight of 14,000 pounds or more, the declared gross weight must be increased, at a minimum, to the expiration of the current declared gross weight license.

   c. The new license fee is one-twelfth of the annual license fee listed in RCW 46.17.355 for each of the number of months remaining in the registration period. The department shall:

      i. Apply credit to any gross weight license fees already paid for the full months remaining in the registration period;

5. Monthly license—Authorized. The annual license fees required in RCW 46.17.355 for any motor vehicle or combination of vehicles having a declared gross weight of twelve thousand one pounds or more may be paid for any full registration month or months at one-twelfth of the annual license fee plus the monthly declared gross weight license fee required in RCW 46.17.360. This sum must be multiplied by the number of full months for which the fees are paid if for less than a full year.

6. Monthly license—Penalty. Operation of a vehicle registered under subsection (5) of this section by any person upon the public highways after the expiration of the monthly license is a traffic infraction. The person shall pay a license fee for the vehicle involved covering an entire registration year's operation, less the fees for any registration month or months of the registration year already paid. If, within five days, a license fee for a full registration year has not been paid as required, the Washington state patrol, county sheriff, or city police shall impound the vehicle until the fees have been paid.

7. Camper, school bus—Exemptions. (a) The weight of a camper must not be included when determining declared gross weight.

   b. Motor vehicles used for the transportation of school children or teachers to and from school and other school activities are exempt from subsection (1) of this section and the seating capacity fee provided in RCW 46.17.340. If the motor vehicle is used for any other purpose, it must be appropriately registered as required under this chapter.

8. Credit for unused license fee. A registered owner of a motor vehicle with a declared gross weight of more than twelve thousand pounds may obtain credit for the unused portion of the license fee paid or transfer the credit to a new owner under the following conditions:

   a. The motor vehicle must have been recently sold or transferred to another owner, is no longer in the possession of the owner, or is reported destroyed under RCW 46.12.600;

   e. Credit as used in this section may not be refunded.
