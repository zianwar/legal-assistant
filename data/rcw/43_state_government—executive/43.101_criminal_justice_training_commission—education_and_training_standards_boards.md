   b. Notify the commission within 15 days of an initial disciplinary decision by an employing agency for alleged behavior or conduct by an officer that is noncriminal and may result in revocation of certification pursuant to RCW 43.101.105.

3. To better enable the commission to act swiftly and comprehensively when misconduct has occurred that may undermine public trust and confidence in law enforcement or the correctional system, if the totality of the circumstances support a conclusion that the officer resigned or retired in anticipation of discipline, whether or not the misconduct was discovered at the time, and when such discipline, if carried forward, would more likely than not have led to discharge, or if the officer was laid off when disciplinary investigation or action was imminent or pending which could have resulted in the officer's suspension or discharge, the employing agency shall conduct and complete the investigation and provide all relevant information to the commission as if the officer were still employed by the agency.

4. Upon request of the commission, the employing agency shall provide such additional documentation or information as the commission deems necessary to determine whether the separation or event provides grounds for suspension or revocation.

5. At its discretion, the commission may:

   a. Initiate decertification proceedings upon conclusion of any investigation or disciplinary proceedings initiated by the employing agency;

   b. Separately pursue action against the officer's certification under RCW 43.101.105; or

   c. Wait to proceed until any investigation, disciplinary proceedings, or appeals through the employing agency are final before taking action. Where a decertification decision requires a finding that the officer's conduct violated policy and the employing agency has begun its investigation into the underlying event, the commission shall await notification of a finding by the employing agency before beginning the decertification process.

6. No action or failure to act by an employing agency or decision resulting from an appeal of that action precludes action by the commission to suspend or revoke an officer's certification.

7. An employing agency may not enter into any agreement or contract with an officer, or union:

   a. Not to report conduct, delay reporting, or preclude disclosure of any relevant information, including a promise not to check the box on a commission notice that indicates the officer may have committed misconduct, in exchange for allowing an officer to resign or retire or for any other reason; or

   b. That allows the agency to destroy or remove any personnel record while the officer is employed and for 10 years thereafter. Such records must include all misconduct and equal employment opportunity complaints, progressive discipline imposed including written reprimands, supervisor coaching, suspensions, involuntary transfers, investigatory files, and other disciplinary appeals and litigation records.

8. The commission shall maintain all information provided pursuant to this section in a permanent file.

9. In addition to disciplinary action authorized in RCW 43.101.105, the commission may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for the failure by an officer or an employing agency to timely and accurately report information pursuant to this section.

## 43.101.145 - Written complaint to deny, suspend, or revoke peace or corrections officer certification—Immunity of complainant.
1. Any individual may submit a written complaint to the commission stating that an officer's certificate should be denied, suspended, or revoked, and specifying the grounds for the complaint. Filing a complaint does not make a complainant a party to the commission's action.

2. The commission has sole discretion whether to investigate a complaint, and the commission has sole discretion whether to investigate matters relating to certification, denial of certification, or revocation of certification on any other basis, without restriction as to the source or the existence of a complaint. All complaints must be resolved with a written determination, regardless of the decision to investigate.

3. The commission may initiate an investigation in any instance where there is a pattern of complaints or other actions that may not have resulted in a formal adjudication of wrongdoing, but when considered together demonstrate conduct that would constitute a violation of RCW 43.101.105 (2) or (3). The commission must consider the agency's policies and procedures and the officer's job duties and assignment in determining what constitutes a pattern.

4. A person who files a complaint in good faith under this section is immune from suit or any civil action related to the filing or the contents of the complaint.

## 43.101.155 - Denial, suspension, or revocation of peace or corrections officer certification—Statement of charges—Notice—Hearing.
1. If the commission determines, upon investigation, that there is cause to believe that a peace officer's or corrections officer's certification should be denied, suspended, or revoked under RCW 43.101.105, the commission must prepare and serve upon the officer a statement of charges. Service on the officer must be by mail or by personal service on the officer unless the officer has consented to service in some other manner, including electronic notification. Notice of the charges must also be mailed to or otherwise served upon the officer's agency of separation and any current agency employer. The statement of charges must be accompanied by a notice that to receive a hearing on the denial or revocation, the officer must, within 60 days of the statement of charges, request a hearing before the hearings panel appointed under RCW 43.101.380. Failure of the officer to request a hearing within the 60-day period constitutes a default, whereupon the commission may enter an order under RCW 34.05.440.

2. If a hearing is requested, the officer is required to provide an email address that constitutes the officer's legal address for purposes of any subsequent communication from the commission. Unless otherwise agreed to by the mutual agreement of the parties or for good cause, within two weeks of receipt of the officer's request for a hearing, the commission shall set a date for the hearing, which must be held within 90 days thereafter. On the date the hearing is set, the commission shall transmit electronic and written notice of the hearing to the officer, and provide public notice on the commission website, specifying the time, date, and place of hearing.

## 43.101.157 - Tribal police officer certification.
1. Tribal governments may voluntarily request certification for their police officers. Tribal governments requesting certification for their police officers must enter into a written agreement with the commission. The agreement must require the tribal law enforcement agency and its officers to comply with all of the requirements for granting, denying, and revoking certification as those requirements are applied to peace officers certified under this chapter and the rules of the commission. To ensure clarity regarding the requirements with which the tribal government and its police officers must comply should the tribal government request certification, a tribal government may first request consultation with the commission.

2. Officers making application for certification as tribal police officers shall meet the requirements of this chapter and the rules of the commission as those requirements are applied to certification of peace officers.

4. In decertification matters where there was a due process hearing or a disciplinary appeals hearing following an investigation by a law enforcement agency, or a criminal hearing regarding the alleged misconduct, the hearings panel need not redetermine the underlying facts but may make its determination based solely on review of the records and decision relating to those proceedings and any investigative or summary materials from the administrative law judge, legal counsel, and commission staff.

The commission is authorized to proceed regardless of whether an arbitrator or other appellate decision maker overturns the discipline imposed by the officer's employing agency or whether the agency settles an appeal. No action or failure to act by a law enforcement agency or corrections agency or decision resulting from an appeal of that action precludes action by the commission to suspend or revoke an officer's certificate, to place on probation, or to require remedial training for the officer.

6. The hearings, but not the deliberations of the hearings panel, are open to the public. The transcripts, admitted evidence, and written decisions of the hearings panel on behalf of the commission are not confidential or exempt from public disclosure, and are subject to subpoena and discovery proceedings in civil actions.
