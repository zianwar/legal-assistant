## 43.340.005 - Purpose—Construction.
The legislature declares it to be the public policy of the state and a recognized governmental function to assist in securitizing the revenue stream from the master settlement agreement between the state and tobacco product manufacturers in order to provide a current and reliable source of revenue for the state. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a tobacco settlement authority having the power to purchase certain rights of the state under the master settlement agreement and to issue nonrecourse revenue bonds to pay outstanding obligations of the state in order to make funds available for increased costs of health care, long-term care, and other programs of the state. This chapter, being necessary for the welfare of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes thereof.

The characterization of such a sale as an absolute transfer shall not be negated or adversely affected by the fact that only a portion of the revenue from the master settlement agreement is being sold and assigned, or by the state's acquisition or retention of an ownership interest in the portion of the revenue from the master settlement agreement not so assigned.

In addition to such other terms, provisions, and conditions as the governor and the authority may determine appropriate for inclusion in the sale agreements, the sale agreements shall contain (a) a covenant of the state that the state will not agree to any amendment of the master settlement agreement that materially and adversely affects the authority's ability to receive the portion of the state's share of master settlement agreement payments that have been sold to the authority; (b) a requirement that the state enforce, at its own expense, the provisions of the master settlement agreement that require the payment of the portion of the state's share of master settlement agreement payments that have been sold to the authority; and (c) a covenant that the state shall take no action that would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of any tax exempt bonds of the authority.

4. On or after the effective date of the sale, the state shall not have any right, title, or interest in the portion of the state's share of the master settlement agreement revenue sold and such portion shall be the property of the authority and not the state, and shall be owned, received, held, and disbursed by the authority or its trustee or assignee, and not the state.

5. The terms of the state's sale to the authority of a portion of the master settlement agreement revenue shall provide that the portion shall be paid directly to the authority or its trustee or assignee. The revenue sold and assigned shall not be received in the treasury of the state and shall not be or deemed to be general state revenues as that term is used in Article VIII, section 1 of the state Constitution.

## 43.340.110 - Dissolution of authority.
The authority shall dissolve no later than two years from the date of final payment of all of its outstanding bonds and the satisfaction of all outstanding obligations of the authority, except to the extent necessary to remain in existence to fulfill any outstanding covenants or provisions with bondholders or third parties made in accordance with this chapter.
