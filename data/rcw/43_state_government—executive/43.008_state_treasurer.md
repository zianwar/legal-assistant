The March 1st certification must be used for distributions occurring on April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st of the year of certification and on January 1st of the year following certification.

   b. By March 1, 2009, the department of revenue must certify the amounts to be distributed under this section on April 1, 2009, July 1, 2009, and October 1, 2009. The certification must be based on calendar year 2008 department of revenue distributions of sales and use taxes authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1), and the population as last determined by the office of financial management.

   c. By October 1, 2009, the department of revenue must certify the amounts to be distributed under this section on January 1, 2010, April 1, 2010, July 1, 2010, and October 1, 2010. The certification must be based on department of revenue distributions in fiscal year 2009 of sales and use taxes authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1), streamlined sales tax mitigation data for mitigation distributions authorized under *RCW 82.14.495 made December 2008 through September 2009, and population as last determined by the office of financial management.

   d. By September 1, 2010, and September 1st of every year thereafter, the department of revenue must make available a preliminary certification of the amounts to be distributed under this section on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st of the year immediately following certification. By October 1, 2010, and October 1st of every year thereafter, the department must finalize the certification. Once finalized, no changes may be made to the certification for any reason. Certifications must be based on distributions of sales and use taxes imposed under RCW 82.14.030(1) made by the department of revenue in the fiscal year that ended during the calendar year of certification, streamlined sales tax mitigation data for mitigation distributions authorized under *RCW 82.14.495 made in the fiscal year that ended during the calendar year of certification, and population as last determined by the office of financial management.

7. All distributions to local governments from the city-county assistance account constitute increases in state distributions of revenue to political subdivisions for purposes of state reimbursement for the costs of new programs and increases in service levels under RCW 43.135.060, including any claims or litigation pending against the state on or after January 1, 2005.

8. As used in this section, "streamlined sales tax mitigation funds" means an amount determined by the department of revenue equal to the actual mitigation distribution amount under *RCW 82.14.495 received by a jurisdiction in four consecutive calendar quarters, less the mitigation distribution amount that would have been received by the jurisdiction during the same four calendar quarters had mitigation been calculated without the local sales tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1). If the difference is a negative amount or if a jurisdiction does not receive any mitigation distribution during the applicable four calendar quarters, then "streamlined sales tax mitigation funds" is zero.
