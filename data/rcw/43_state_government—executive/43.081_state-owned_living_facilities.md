## 43.81.010 - Legislative declaration.
The legislature recognizes that significant benefits accrue to the state and that certain types of state operations are more efficient when personnel services are available on an extended basis. Such operations include certain types of facilities managed by agencies such as the departments of natural resources, corrections, fish and wildlife, social and health services, transportation, and veterans affairs, and the parks and recreation commission.

The means of assuring that such personnel are available on an extended basis is through the establishment of on-site state-owned or leased living facilities. The legislature also recognizes the restrictions and hardship placed upon those personnel who are required to reside in such state-owned or leased living facilities in order to provide extended personnel services.

The legislature further recognizes that there are instances where it is to the benefit of the state to have state-owned or leased living facilities occupied even though such occupancy is not required by the agency as a condition of employment.

2. Whenever an agency determines that (a) a living facility owned or leased by the agency is not occupied by employees under subsection (1) of this section and (b) it would be to the agency's benefit to have the facility occupied by an employee of the agency whose duties involve extended personnel services associated with the work site upon which the living facility is located or at work site near to where the living facility is located, the agency may make the facility available to such employee.

3. Whenever an agency determines that (a) a living facility owned or leased by the agency is not occupied by employees under subsection (1) of this section and (b) the facility has been made available to employees under subsection (2) of this section and that no such employees have opted to reside in the facility, the agency may make the facility available for occupancy to other interested parties.
