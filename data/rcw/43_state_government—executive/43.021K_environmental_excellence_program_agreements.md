## 43.21K.005 - Purpose—1997 c 381.
The purpose of chapter 381, Laws of 1997 is to create a voluntary program authorizing environmental excellence program agreements with persons regulated under the environmental laws of the state of Washington, and to direct agencies of the state of Washington to solicit and support the development of agreements that use innovative environmental measures or strategies to achieve environmental results more effectively or efficiently.

Agencies shall encourage environmental excellence program agreements that favor or promote pollution prevention, source reduction, or improvements in practices that are transferable to other interested entities or that can achieve better overall environmental results than required by otherwise applicable rules and requirements.

In enacting chapter 381, Laws of 1997 it is not the intent of the legislature that state environmental standards be applied in a manner that could result in these state standards being waived under section 121 of the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 9261 [9621]).

\[ [1997 c 381 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1866-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20381%20§%201); \]

2. "Coordinating agency" means the state, regional, or local agency with the primary regulatory responsibility for the proposed environmental excellence program agreement. If multiple agencies have jurisdiction to administer state environmental laws affected by an environmental excellence agreement, the department of ecology shall designate or act as the coordinating agency.

3. "Director" means the individual or body of individuals in whom the ultimate legal authority of an agency is vested by any provision of law. If the agency head is a body of individuals, a majority of those individuals constitutes the director.

4. "Environmental laws" means chapters 43.21A, 70A.15, 70A.205, 70A.300, 70A.125, 77.55, 90.48, 90.52, 90.58, 90.64, and 90.71 RCW, and RCW 90.54.020(3)(b) and rules adopted under those chapters and section. The term environmental laws as used in this chapter does not include any provision of the Revised Code of Washington, or of any municipal ordinance or enactment, that regulates the selection of a location for a new facility.

5. "Facility" means a site or activity that is regulated under any of the provisions of the environmental laws.

6. "Legal requirement" includes any provision of an environmental law, rule, order, or permit.

7. "Sponsor" means the owner or operator of a facility, including a municipal corporation, subject to regulation under the environmental laws of the state of Washington, or an authorized representative of the owner or operator, that submits a proposal for an environmental excellence program agreement.

8.

## 43.21K.020 - Agreements—Environmental results.
An environmental excellence program agreement entered into under this chapter must achieve more effective or efficient environmental results than the results that would be otherwise achieved. The basis for comparison shall be a reasonable estimate of the overall impact of the participating facility on the environment in the absence of an environmental excellence program agreement. More effective environmental results are results that are better overall than those that would be achieved under the legal requirements superseded or replaced by the agreement. More efficient environmental results are results that are achieved at reduced cost but do not decrease the overall environmental results achieved by the participating facility. An environmental excellence program agreement may not authorize either (1) the release of water pollutants that will cause to be exceeded, at points of compliance in the ambient environment established pursuant to law, numeric surface water or groundwater quality criteria or numeric sediment quality criteria adopted as rules under chapter 90.48 RCW; or (2) the emission of any air contaminants that will cause to be exceeded any air quality standard as defined in RCW 70A.15.1030(3); or (3) a decrease in the overall environmental results achieved by the participating facility compared with results achieved over a representative period before the date on which the agreement is proposed by the sponsor. However, an environmental excellence program agreement may authorize reasonable increases in the release of pollutants to permit increases in facility production or facility expansion and modification.

## 43.21K.090 - Judicial review.
1. A decision by the directors of state, regional, or local agencies to approve a proposed environmental excellence program agreement, or to terminate or modify an approved environmental excellence program agreement, is subject to judicial review in superior court. For purposes of judicial review, the court may grant relief from the decision to approve or modify an environmental excellence program agreement only if it determines that the action: (a) Violates constitutional provisions; (b) exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; (c) was arbitrary and capricious; or (d) was taken without compliance with the procedures provided by this chapter. However, the decision of the director or directors shall be accorded substantial deference by the court. A decision not to enter into or modify an environmental excellence program agreement and a decision not to accept a commitment under RCW 43.21K.080(4) to comply with the terms of a programmatic environmental excellence [program] agreement are within the sole discretion of the directors of the state, regional, or local agencies and are not subject to review.

2. An appeal from a decision to approve or modify a facility specific or a programmatic environmental excellence program agreement is not timely unless filed with the superior court and served on the parties to the environmental excellence program agreement within thirty days of the date on which the agreement or modification is signed by the director. For an environmental excellence program agreement or modification signed by more than one director, there is only one appeal, and the time for appeal shall run from the last date on which the agreement or modification is signed by a director.

3. A decision to accept the commitment of a specific facility to comply with the terms of a programmatic environmental excellence program agreement, or to modify the application of an agreement to a specific facility, is subject to judicial review as described in subsection (1) of this section. An appeal is not timely unless filed with the superior court and served on the directors signing the agreement, the sponsor, and the owner or operator of the specific facility within thirty days of the date the director or directors that signed the programmatic agreement approve the owner or operator's commitment to comply with the agreement. For a programmatic environmental excellence program agreement or modification signed by more than one director, there shall be only one appeal and the time for appeal shall run from the last date on which a director approves the commitment.

4. The issuance of permits and permit modifications is subject to review under otherwise applicable law.

5. An appeal of a decision by a director under *section 11 of this act to terminate in whole or in part a facility specific or programmatic environmental excellence program agreement is not timely unless filed with the superior court and served on the director within thirty days of the date on which notice of the termination is issued under *section 11(2) of this act.

\[ [1997 c 381 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1866-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20381%20§%2010); \]

## 43.21K.100 - Continued effect of agreements and permits—Modification of affected permit or approval.
After a termination under *section 11 of this act is final and no longer subject to judicial review, the sponsor has sixty days in which to apply for any permit or approval affected by any terminated portion of the environmental excellence program agreement. An application filed during the sixty-day period shall be deemed a timely application for renewal of a permit under the terms of any applicable law. Except as provided in *section 11(4) of this act, the terms and conditions of the environmental excellence program agreement and of permits issued will continue in effect until a final permit or approval is issued. If the sponsor fails to submit a timely or complete application, any affected permit or approval may be modified at any time that is consistent with applicable law.

\[ [1997 c 381 § 12](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1866-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20381%20§%2012); \]

## 43.21K.110 - Enforceable and voluntary commitments—Enforcement actions.
1. The legal requirements contained in the environmental excellence program agreement in accordance with RCW 43.21K.060(2) are enforceable commitments of the facility covered by the agreement. Any violation of these legal requirements is subject to penalties and remedies to the same extent as the legal requirements that they superseded or replaced.

2. The voluntary goals stated in the environmental excellence program agreement in accordance with RCW 43.21K.060(3) are voluntary commitments of the facility covered by the agreement. If the facility fails to meet these goals, it shall not be subject to any form of enforcement action, including penalties, orders, or any form of injunctive relief. The failure to make substantial progress in meeting these goals may be a basis on which to terminate the environmental excellence program agreement under *section 11 of this act.

3. Nothing in this chapter limits the authority of an agency, the attorney general, or a prosecuting attorney to initiate an enforcement action for violation of any applicable legal requirement. However, no civil, criminal, or administrative action may be brought with respect to any legal requirement that is superseded or replaced under the terms of an environmental excellence program agreement.

4. This chapter does not create any new authority for citizen suits, and does not alter or amend other statutory provisions authorizing citizen suits.

\[ [1997 c 381 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1866-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20381%20§%2013); \]

## 43.21K.130 - Rule-making authority.
Any state, regional, or local agency administering programs under an environmental law may adopt rules or ordinances to implement this chapter. However, it is not necessary that an agency adopt rules or ordinances in order to consider or enter into environmental excellence program agreements.

\[ [1997 c 381 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1866-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20381%20§%2016); \]

## 43.21K.140 - Advisory committee.
The director of the department of ecology shall appoint an advisory committee to review the effectiveness of the environmental excellence program agreement program and to make a recommendation to the legislature concerning the continuation, termination, or modification of the program. The committee also may make recommendations it considers appropriate for revision of any regulatory program that is affected by an environmental excellence program agreement. The committee shall be composed of one representative each from two state agencies, two representatives of the regulated community, and two representatives of environmental organizations or other public interest groups. The committee must submit a report and its recommendation to the legislature not later than October 31, 2001. The department of ecology shall provide the advisory committee with such support as they may require.

\[ [1997 c 381 § 17](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1866-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20381%20§%2017); \]

## 43.21K.150 - Costs of processing proposals—Fees—Voluntary contributions.
1. Agencies authorized to enter into environmental excellence program agreements may assess and collect a fee to recover the costs of processing environmental excellence program agreement proposals. The amount of the fee may not exceed the direct and indirect costs of processing the environmental excellence program agreement proposal. Processing includes, but is not limited to: Working with the sponsor to develop the agreement, meeting with stakeholder groups, conducting public meetings and hearings, preparing a record of the decision to enter into or modify an agreement, and defending any appeal from a decision to enter into or modify an agreement. Fees also may include, to the extent specified by the agreement, the agencies' direct costs of monitoring compliance with those specific terms of an agreement not covered by permits issued to the participating facility.

2. Agencies assessing fees may graduate the initial fees for processing an environmental excellence program agreement proposal to account for the size of the sponsor and to make the environmental excellence program agreement program more available to small businesses.
