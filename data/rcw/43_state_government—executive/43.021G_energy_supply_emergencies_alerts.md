## 43.21G.010 - Legislative finding—Intent.
The legislature finds that energy in various forms is increasingly subject to possible shortages and supply disruptions, to the point that there may be foreseen an emergency situation, and that without the ability to institute appropriate emergency measures to regulate the production, distribution, and use of energy, a severe impact on the public health, safety, and general welfare of our state's citizens may occur. The prevention or mitigation of such energy shortages or disruptions and their effects is necessary for preservation of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of this state.

It is the intent of this chapter to:

1. Establish necessary emergency powers for the governor and define the situations under which such powers are to be exercised;

2. Provide penalties for violations of this chapter.

It is further the intent of the legislature that in developing proposed orders under the powers granted in RCW 43.21G.040 as now or hereafter amended the governor may utilize, on a temporary or ad hoc basis, the knowledge and expertise of persons experienced in the technical aspects of energy supply, distribution, or use. Such utilization shall be in addition to support received by the governor from the *department of community, trade, and economic development under RCW 43.21F.045 and ** 43.21F.065 and from other state agencies.

## 43.21G.030 - Intent in developing energy production, allocation, and consumption programs.

   b. Upon finding that an energy emergency exists within this state or any part thereof, declare a condition of energy emergency. A condition of energy emergency shall terminate thirty consecutive days after the declaration of such condition if the legislature is not in session at the time of such declaration and if the governor fails to convene the legislature pursuant to Article III, section 7 of the Constitution of the state of Washington within thirty consecutive days of such declaration. If the legislature is in session or convened, in accordance with this subsection, the duration of the condition of energy emergency shall be limited in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

Upon the declaration of a condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency, the governor shall present to the committee any proposed plans for programs, controls, standards, and priorities for the production, allocation, and consumption of energy during any current or anticipated condition of energy emergency, any proposed plans for the suspension or modification of existing rules of the Washington Administrative Code, and any other relevant matters the governor deems desirable. The governor shall review any recommendations of the committee concerning such plans and matters.

Upon the declaration of a condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency, the emergency powers as set forth in this chapter shall become effective only within the area described in the declaration.

   c. Upon the request of the governor, extended by declaration of the legislature by concurrent resolution of a continuing energy supply alert.

An initial extension of an energy supply alert approved and implemented under this subsection shall be for a specified period of time not to exceed ninety consecutive days after the expiration of the original declaration. Any subsequent extensions shall be for a specified period of time not to exceed one hundred twenty consecutive days after the expiration of the previous extension.

3. A condition of energy emergency shall terminate forty-five consecutive days after the declaration of such condition unless:

   a. Extended by the governor upon issuing a finding that the energy emergency continues to exist, and with prior approval of such an extension by the committee; or

4. A condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency shall cease to exist upon a declaration to that effect by either of the following: (a) The governor; or (b) the legislature, by concurrent resolution, if in regular or special session: PROVIDED, That the governor shall terminate a condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency when the energy supply situation upon which the declaration of a condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency was based no longer exists.

5. In a condition of energy supply alert, the governor may, as deemed necessary to preserve and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize, to the fullest extent possible, the injurious economic, social, and environmental consequences of such energy supply alert, issue orders to: (a) Suspend or modify existing rules of the Washington Administrative Code of any state agency relating to the consumption of energy by such agency or to the production of energy, and (b) direct any state or local governmental agency to implement programs relating to the consumption of energy by the agency which have been developed by the governor or the agency and reviewed by the committee.

6. In addition to the powers in subsection (5) of this section, in a condition of energy emergency, the governor may, as deemed necessary to preserve and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize, to the fullest extent possible, the injurious economic, social, and environmental consequences of such an emergency, issue orders to: (a) Implement programs, controls, standards, and priorities for the production, allocation, and consumption of energy; (b) suspend and modify existing pollution control standards and requirements or any other standards or requirements affecting or affected by the use of energy, including those relating to air or water quality control; and (c) establish and implement regional programs and agreements for the purposes of coordinating the energy programs and actions of the state with those of the federal government and of other states and localities.

The governor shall immediately transmit the declaration of a condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency and the findings upon which the declaration is based and any orders issued under the powers granted in this chapter to the committee. The governor shall provide the committee with at least fourteen days' notice when requesting an extension of a condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency, unless such notice is waived by the committee.

8. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to mean that any program, control, standard, priority or other policy created under the authority of the emergency powers authorized by this chapter shall have any continuing legal effect after the cessation of the condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency.

9. If any provision of this chapter is in conflict with any other provision, limitation, or restriction which is now in effect under any other law of this state, including, but not limited to, chapter 34.05 RCW, this chapter shall govern and control, and such other law or rule issued thereunder shall be deemed superseded for the purposes of this chapter.
