## 43.21B.320 - Stays of orders.
1. A person appealing to the hearings board an order, not stayed by the issuing agency, may obtain a stay of the effectiveness of that order only as set forth in this section.

2. An appealing party may request a stay by including such a request in the appeal document, in a subsequent motion, or by such other means as the rules of the hearings board shall prescribe. The request must be accompanied by a statement of grounds for the stay and evidence setting forth the factual basis upon which request is based. The hearings board shall hear the request for a stay as soon as possible. The hearing on the request for stay may be consolidated with the hearing on the merits.

3. The applicant may make a prima facie case for stay if the applicant demonstrates either a likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal or irreparable harm. Upon such a showing, the hearings board shall grant the stay unless the issuing agency demonstrates either (a) a substantial probability of success on the merits or (b) likelihood of success on the merits and an overriding public interest which justifies denial of the stay.

4. Unless otherwise stipulated by the parties, the hearings board, after granting or denying an application for a stay, shall expedite the hearing and decision on the merits.

5. Any party or other person aggrieved by the grant or denial of a stay by the hearings board may petition the superior court for Thurston county for review of that decision pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW pending the appeal on the merits before the board. The superior court shall expedite its review of the decision of the hearings board.
