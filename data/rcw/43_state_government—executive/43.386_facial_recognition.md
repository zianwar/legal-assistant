## 43.386.010 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Accountability report" means a report developed in accordance with RCW 43.386.020.

2. "Enroll," "enrolled," or "enrolling" means the process by which a facial recognition service creates a facial template from one or more images of an individual and adds the facial template to a gallery used by the facial recognition service for recognition or persistent tracking of individuals. It also includes the act of adding an existing facial template directly into a gallery used by a facial recognition service.

3. [Empty]

   a. "Facial recognition service" means technology that analyzes facial features and is used by a state or local government agency for the identification, verification, or persistent tracking of individuals in still or video images.

   b. "Facial recognition service" does not include: (i) The analysis of facial features to grant or deny access to an electronic device; or (ii) the use of an automated or semiautomated process for the purpose of redacting a recording for release or disclosure outside the law enforcement agency to protect the privacy of a subject depicted in the recording, if the process does not generate or result in the retention of any biometric data or surveillance information.

4. "Facial template" means the machine-interpretable pattern of facial features that is extracted from one or more images of an individual by a facial recognition service.

5. "Identification" means the use of a facial recognition service by a state or local government agency to determine whether an unknown individual matches any individual whose identity is known to the state or local government agency and who has been enrolled by reference to that identity in a gallery used by the facial recognition service.

6. "Legislative authority" means the respective city, county, or other local governmental agency's council, commission, or other body in which legislative powers are vested. For a port district, the legislative authority refers to the port district's port commission. For an airport established pursuant to chapter 14.08 RCW and operated by a board, the legislative authority refers to the airport's board. For a state agency, "legislative authority" refers to the technology services board created in RCW 43.105.285.

7. "Meaningful human review" means review or oversight by one or more individuals who are trained in accordance with RCW 43.386.060 and who have the authority to alter the decision under review.

8. "Nonidentifying demographic data" means data that is not linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, and includes, at a minimum, information about gender, race or ethnicity, age, and location.

9. "Ongoing surveillance" means using a facial recognition service to track the physical movements of a specified individual through one or more public places over time, whether in real time or through application of a facial recognition service to historical records. It does not include a single recognition or attempted recognition of an individual, if no attempt is made to subsequently track that individual's movement over time after they have been recognized.

10. "Persistent tracking" means the use of a facial recognition service by a state or local government agency to track the movements of an individual on a persistent basis without identification or verification of that individual. Such tracking becomes persistent as soon as:

    a. The facial template that permits the tracking is maintained for more than forty-eight hours after first enrolling that template; or

    b. Data created by the facial recognition service is linked to any other data such that the individual who has been tracked is identified or identifiable.

11. "Recognition" means the use of a facial recognition service by a state or local government agency to determine whether an unknown individual matches:

    a. Any individual who has been enrolled in a gallery used by the facial recognition service; or

    b. A specific individual who has been enrolled in a gallery used by the facial recognition service.

12. "Verification" means the use of a facial recognition service by a state or local government agency to determine whether an individual is a specific individual whose identity is known to the state or local government agency and who has been enrolled by reference to that identity in a gallery used by the facial recognition service.

## 43.386.030 - Meaningful human review—When required.
A state or local government agency using a facial recognition service to make decisions that produce legal effects concerning individuals or similarly significant effects concerning individuals must ensure that those decisions are subject to meaningful human review. Decisions that produce legal effects concerning individuals or similarly significant effects concerning individuals means decisions that result in the provision or denial of financial and lending services, housing, insurance, education enrollment, criminal justice, employment opportunities, health care services, or access to basic necessities such as food and water, or that impact civil rights of individuals.

\[ [2020 c 257 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6280-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20257%20§%204); \]

## 43.386.040 - Testing—When required.
Prior to deploying a facial recognition service in the context in which it will be used, a state or local government agency using a facial recognition service to make decisions that produce legal effects on individuals or similarly significant effects on individuals must test the facial recognition service in operational conditions. An agency must take reasonable steps to ensure best quality results by following all guidance provided by the developer of the facial recognition service.

\[ [2020 c 257 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6280-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20257%20§%205); \]

## 43.386.050 - Performance differences across subpopulations—Testing and mitigation.
1. [Empty]

   a. A state or local government agency that deploys a facial recognition service must require a facial recognition service provider to make available an application programming interface or other technical capability, chosen by the provider, to enable legitimate, independent, and reasonable tests of those facial recognition services for accuracy and unfair performance differences across distinct subpopulations. Such subpopulations are defined by visually detectable characteristics such as: (i) Race, skin tone, ethnicity, gender, age, or disability status; or (ii) other protected characteristics that are objectively determinable or self-identified by the individuals portrayed in the testing data set. If the results of the independent testing identify material unfair performance differences across subpopulations, the provider must develop and implement a plan to mitigate the identified performance differences within ninety days of receipt of such results. For purposes of mitigating the identified performance differences, the methodology and data used in the independent testing must be disclosed to the provider in a manner that allows full reproduction.

   b. Making an application programming interface or other technical capability does not require providers to do so in a manner that would increase the risk of cyberattacks or to disclose proprietary data. Providers bear the burden of minimizing these risks when making an application programming interface or other technical capability available for testing.

2. Nothing in this section requires a state or local government agency to collect or provide data to a facial recognition service provider to satisfy the requirements in subsection (1) of this section.

\[ [2020 c 257 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6280-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%20257%20§%206); \]

## 43.386.060 - Training.
A state or local government agency using a facial recognition service must conduct periodic training of all individuals who operate a facial recognition service or who process personal data obtained from the use of a facial recognition service. The training must include, but not be limited to, coverage of:

1. The capabilities and limitations of the facial recognition service;

2. Procedures to interpret and act on the output of the facial recognition service; and

3. To the extent applicable to the deployment context, the meaningful human review requirement for decisions that produce legal effects concerning individuals or similarly significant effects concerning individuals.

## 43.386.900 - Findings—2020 c 257.
The legislature finds that:

1. Unconstrained use of facial recognition services by state and local government agencies poses broad social ramifications that should be considered and addressed. Accordingly, legislation is required to establish safeguards that will allow state and local government agencies to use facial recognition services in a manner that benefits society while prohibiting uses that threaten our democratic freedoms and put our civil liberties at risk.

2. However, state and local government agencies may use facial recognition services to locate or identify missing persons, and identify deceased persons, including missing or murdered indigenous women, subjects of Amber alerts and silver alerts, and other possible crime victims, for the purposes of keeping the public safe.
