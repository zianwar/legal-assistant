## 43.21F.010 - Legislative findings and declaration.
1. The legislature finds that the state needs to implement a comprehensive energy planning process that:

   a. Is based on high quality, unbiased analysis;

   b. Engages public agencies and stakeholders in a thoughtful, deliberative process that creates a cohesive plan that earns sustained support of the public and organizations and institutions that will ultimately be responsible for implementation and execution of the plan; and

   c. Establishes policies and practices needed to ensure the effective implementation of the strategy.

2. The legislature further finds that energy drives the entire modern economy from petroleum for vehicles to electricity to light homes and power businesses. The legislature further finds that the nation and the world have started the transition to a clean energy economy, with significant improvements in energy efficiency and investments in new clean and renewable energy resources and technologies. The legislature further finds this transition may increase or decrease energy costs and efforts should be made to mitigate cost increases.

3. The legislature finds and declares that it is the continuing purpose of state government, consistent with other essential considerations of state policy, to foster wise and efficient energy use and to promote energy self-sufficiency through the use of indigenous and renewable energy sources, consistent with the promotion of reliable energy sources, the general welfare, and the protection of environmental quality.

4. The legislature further declares that a successful state energy strategy must balance three goals to:

   a. Maintain competitive energy prices that are fair and reasonable for consumers and businesses and support our state's continued economic success;

   b. Increase competitiveness by fostering a clean energy economy and jobs through business and workforce development; and

   c. Meet the state's obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
