## 43.43.040 - Disability of patrol officers.
1. The chief of the Washington state patrol shall relieve from active duty Washington state patrol officers who, while in the performance of their official duties, or while on standby or available for duty, have been or hereafter may be injured or incapacitated to such an extent as to be mentally or physically incapable of active service: PROVIDED, That:

   a. Any officer disabled while performing line duty who is found by the chief to be physically incapacitated shall be placed on disability leave for a period not to exceed six months from the date of injury or the date incapacitated. During this period, the officer shall be entitled to all pay, benefits, insurance, leave, and retirement contributions awarded to an officer on active status, less any compensation received through the department of labor and industries. No such disability leave shall be approved until an officer has been unavailable for duty for more than forty consecutive work hours. Prior to the end of the six-month period, the chief shall either place the officer on disability status or return the officer to active status.

For the purposes of this section, "line duty" is active service which encompasses the traffic law enforcement duties and/or other law enforcement responsibilities of the state patrol. These activities encompass all enforcement practices of the laws, accident and criminal investigations, or actions requiring physical exertion or exposure to hazardous elements.

The chief shall define by rule the situations where a disability has occurred during line duty;

   b. Benefits under this section for a disability that is incurred while in other employment will be reduced by any amount the officer receives or is entitled to receive from workers' compensation, social security, group insurance, other pension plan, or any other similar source provided by another employer on account of the same disability;

   c. An officer injured while engaged in willfully tortious or criminal conduct shall not be entitled to disability benefits under this section; and

   d. Should a disability beneficiary whose disability was not incurred in line of duty, prior to attaining age fifty, engage in a gainful occupation, the chief shall reduce the amount of his or her retirement allowance to an amount which when added to the compensation earned by him or her in such occupation shall not exceed the basic salary currently being paid for the rank the retired officer held at the time he or she was disabled. All such disability beneficiaries under age fifty shall file with the chief every six months a signed and sworn statement of earnings and any person who shall knowingly swear falsely on such statement shall be subject to prosecution for perjury. Should the earning capacity of such beneficiary be further altered, the chief may further alter his or her disability retirement allowance as indicated above. The failure of any officer to file the required statement of earnings shall be cause for cancellation of retirement benefits.

2. [Empty]

   a. Officers on disability status shall receive one-half of their compensation at the existing wage, during the time the disability continues in effect, less any compensation received through the department of labor and industries. They shall be subject to mental or physical examination at any state institution or otherwise under the direction of the chief of the patrol at any time during such relief from duty to ascertain whether or not they are able to resume active duty.

   b. In addition to the compensation provided in (a) of this subsection, the compensation of an officer who is totally disabled during line duty shall include reimbursement for any payments of premiums made after June 10, 2010, for employer-provided medical insurance. An officer is considered totally disabled if he or she is unable to perform any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental condition that may be expected to result in death or that has lasted or is expected to last at least twelve months. Substantial gainful activity is defined as average earnings in excess of eight hundred sixty dollars a month in 2006 adjusted annually as determined by the department of retirement systems based on federal social security disability standards. An officer in receipt of reimbursement for any payments of premium rates for employer-provided medical insurance under this subsection is required to file with the chief any financial records that are necessary to determine continued eligibility for such reimbursement. The failure of any officer to file the required financial records is cause for cancellation of the reimbursement. The legislature reserves the right to amend or repeal the benefits provided in this subsection (2)(b) in the future and no member or beneficiary has a contractual right to receive any distribution not granted prior to that time.

The dissolution order must specifically divide both the member's benefit and any spousal or domestic partner survivor benefit, and must fully comply with RCW 41.50.670 and 41.50.700.

3. If a member should die, either while in service or after retirement, the member's surviving unmarried children under the age of eighteen years shall be provided for in the following manner:

The combined benefits to the surviving spouse or domestic partner and all children shall not exceed sixty percent of the final average salary of the member or retired member; and

   b. If there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner or the spouse or domestic partner should die, the child or children shall be entitled to a benefit equal to thirty percent of the final average salary of the member or retired member for one child and an additional ten percent for each additional child. The combined benefits to the children under this subsection shall not exceed sixty percent of the final average salary of the member or retired member. Payments under this subsection shall be prorated equally among the children, if more than one.

4. If a member should die in the line of duty while employed by the Washington state patrol, or a member leaves the employ of the employer due to service in the national guard or military reserves and dies while honorably serving in the national guard or military reserves during a period of war as defined in RCW 41.04.005, the member's surviving children under the age of twenty years and eleven months if attending any high school, college, university, or vocational or other educational institution accredited or approved by the state of Washington shall be provided for in the following manner:

   b. If there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner or the spouse or domestic partner should die, the unmarried child or children shall be entitled to receive a benefit equal to thirty percent of the final average salary of the member or retired member for one child and an additional ten percent for each additional child. The combined benefits to the children under this subsection shall not exceed sixty percent of the final average salary. Payments under this subsection shall be prorated equally among the children, if more than one; and

   c. If a beneficiary under this subsection reaches the age of twenty-one years during the middle of a term of enrollment the benefit shall continue until the end of that term.

5. [Empty]

   a. The provisions of this section shall apply to members who have been retired on disability as provided in RCW 43.43.040 if the officer was a member of the Washington state patrol retirement system at the time of such disability retirement.

   b. For the purposes of this subsection, average final salary as used in subsection (2) of this section means:

      i. For members commissioned prior to January 1, 2003, the average monthly salary received by active members of the patrol of the rank at which the member became disabled, during the two years prior to the death of the disabled member; and

      ii. For members commissioned on or after January 1, 2003, the average monthly salary received by active members of the patrol of the rank at which the member became disabled, during the five years prior to the death of the disabled member.

   a. Standard allowance. A member electing this option shall receive a retirement allowance payable throughout the member's life. However, if the retiree dies before the total of the retirement allowance paid to the retiree equals the amount of the retiree's accumulated contributions at the time of retirement, then the balance shall be paid to the member's estate, or such person or persons, trust, or organization as the retiree shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the department; or if there be no such designated person or persons still living at the time of the retiree's death, then to the surviving spouse or domestic partner; or if there be neither such designated person or persons still living at the time of death nor a surviving spouse or domestic partner, then to the retiree's legal representative.

   b. The department shall adopt rules that allow a member to select a retirement option that pays the member a reduced retirement allowance and upon death, such portion of the member's reduced retirement allowance as the department by rule designates shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to a designated person.

2. [Empty]

   a. A member, if married or in a domestic partnership, must provide the written consent of his or her spouse or domestic partner to the option selected under this section, except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection. If a member is married or in a domestic partnership and both the member and member's spouse or domestic partner do not give written consent to an option under this section, the department will pay the member a joint and fifty percent survivor benefit and record the member's spouse or domestic partner as the beneficiary. This benefit shall be calculated to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit options available under subsection (1) of this section unless consent by the spouse or domestic partner is not required as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection.

   b. Written consent from a spouse or domestic partner is not required if a member who is married or a domestic partner selects a joint and survivor option under subsection (1)(b) of this section and names the member's spouse or domestic partner as the survivor beneficiary.

   c. If a copy of a dissolution order designating a survivor beneficiary under RCW 41.50.790 has been filed with the department at least thirty days prior to a member's retirement:

      i. The department shall honor the designation as if made by the member under subsection (1) of this section; and

      ii. The spouse or domestic partner consent provisions of (a) of this subsection do not apply.

3. No later than January 1, 2003, the department shall adopt rules that allow a member additional actuarially equivalent survivor benefit options, and shall include, but are not limited to:

   a. [Empty]

      i. A retired member who retired without designating a survivor beneficiary shall have the opportunity to designate their spouse or domestic partner from a postretirement marriage or domestic partnership as a survivor during a one-year period beginning one year after the date of the postretirement marriage or domestic partnership provided the retirement allowance payable to the retiree is not subject to periodic payments pursuant to a property division obligation as provided for in RCW 41.50.670.

      ii. A member who entered into a postretirement marriage or domestic partnership prior to the effective date of the rules adopted pursuant to this subsection and satisfies the conditions of (a)(i) of this subsection shall have one year to designate their spouse or domestic partner as a survivor beneficiary following the adoption of the rules.

   b. A retired member who elected to receive a reduced retirement allowance under this section and designated a nonspouse or a nondomestic partner as survivor beneficiary shall have the opportunity to remove the survivor designation and have their future benefit adjusted.

   c. The department may make an additional charge, if necessary, to ensure that the benefits provided under this subsection remain actuarially equivalent.

4. No later than July 1, 2003, the department shall adopt rules to permit:

   a. A court-approved property settlement incident to a court decree of dissolution made before retirement to provide that benefits payable to a member who has completed at least five years of service and the member's divorcing spouse or former domestic partner be divided into two separate benefits payable over the life of each spouse or domestic partner.

The member shall have available the benefit options of subsection (1) of this section upon retirement, and if remarried or in a domestic partnership at the time of retirement remains subject to the spouse or domestic partner consent requirements of subsection (2) of this section. Any reductions of the member's benefit subsequent to the division into two separate benefits shall be made solely to the separate benefit of the member.

The nonmember ex spouse or former domestic partner shall be eligible to commence receiving their separate benefit upon reaching the ages provided in RCW 43.43.250(2) and after filing a written application with the department.

   b. A court-approved property settlement incident to a court decree of dissolution made after retirement may only divide the benefit into two separate benefits payable over the life of each spouse or domestic partner if the nonmember ex spouse or former domestic partner was selected as a survivor beneficiary at retirement.

The retired member may later choose the survivor benefit options available in subsection (3) of this section. Any actuarial reductions subsequent to the division into two separate benefits shall be made solely to the separate benefit of the member.

Both the retired member and the nonmember divorced spouse or former domestic partner shall be eligible to commence receiving their separate benefits upon filing a copy of the dissolution order with the department in accordance with RCW 41.50.670.

   c. The department may make an additional charge or adjustment if necessary to ensure that the separate benefits provided under this subsection are actuarially equivalent to the benefits payable prior to the decree of dissolution.

5. Beginning on the date that the state receives a determination from the federal internal revenue service that this subsection (5) conforms with federal law, retirees have up to ninety calendar days after the receipt of their first retirement allowance to change their survivor election under subsections (1) and (2) of this section. If a member changes the member's survivor election under this subsection the change is effective the first of the following month and is prospective only.

   a. The minimum monthly salary paid to state patrol troopers and sergeants must be competitive with law enforcement agencies within the boundaries of the state of Washington, guided by the results of a survey undertaken in the collective bargaining process during each biennium. Compensation must be calculated using base salary, premium pay (a pay received by more than a majority of employees), education pay, and longevity pay. The compensation comparison data is based on the Washington state patrol and the law enforcement agencies listed in this section. Increases for sergeants will be extended to the salary levels for captains and lieutenants through the collective bargaining process to ensure proportionality of increases.

   b. [Empty]

      i. Until July 1, 2028, the comparisons for determining competitiveness with other law enforcement agency salary levels must be guided by the average of compensation paid to the corresponding rank from the Seattle police department, King county sheriff's office, Tacoma police department, Snohomish county sheriff's office, Spokane police department, and Vancouver police department.

      ii. Beginning July 1, 2028, the comparisons for determining competitiveness with other law enforcement agency salary levels must be guided by the average of compensation paid to the corresponding rank from the Seattle police department, King county sheriff's office, Tacoma police department, Snohomish county sheriff's office, Spokane police department, and Vancouver police department, unless the office of financial management determines that one or more agencies should be replaced in this comparison with another law enforcement agency pursuant to the periodic evaluation process specified in (b)(iii) of this subsection.

      iii. By January 1, 2028, and each decade thereafter, the office of financial management must conduct an evaluation of the six agencies that are relevant for comparison to ensure state patrol troopers and sergeant salary levels are competitive with other law enforcement agencies within the boundaries of the state of Washington. If the office of financial management determines that one or more agencies specified in (b)(ii) of this subsection should be replaced in this comparison with a different law enforcement agency that is more relevant to ensure salary competitiveness, the office of financial management may utilize that revised compensation comparison data in the survey undertaken in the collective bargaining process during each biennium.

2. By December 1, 2024, as part of the salary survey required in this section, the office of financial management must report to the governor and transportation committees of the legislature on the efficacy of Washington state patrol recruitment and retention efforts. Using the results of the 2016 salary survey as the baseline data, the report must include an analysis of voluntary resignations of state patrol troopers and sergeants and a comparison of state patrol academy class sizes and trooper graduations.

## 43.43.390 - Bicycle awareness program—Generally.
Bicycling is increasing in popularity as a form of recreation and as an alternative mode of transportation. To make bicycling safer, the various law enforcement agencies should enforce traffic regulations for bicyclists. By enforcing bicycle regulations, law enforcement officers are reinforcing educational programs. Bicycling takes more skill than most people realize. Since bicyclists have a low profile in traffic and are unprotected, they need more defensive riding skills than motorists do.

A bicycle awareness program is created within the Washington state patrol. In developing the curriculum for the bicycle awareness program the patrol shall consult with the traffic safety commission and with bicycling groups providing bicycle safety education. The patrol shall conduct the program in conjunction with the safety education officer program and may use other law enforcement personnel and volunteers to implement the program for children in grades kindergarten through six. The patrol shall ensure that each safety educator presenting the bicycle awareness program has received specialized training in bicycle safety education and has been trained in effective defensive bicycle riding skills.

## 43.43.753 - Findings—DNA identification system—DNA database—DNA data bank.
The legislature finds that recent developments in molecular biology and genetics have important applications for forensic science. It has been scientifically established that there is a unique pattern to the chemical structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contained in each cell of the human body. The process for identifying this pattern is called "DNA identification."

The legislature further finds that DNA databases are important tools in criminal investigations, in the exclusion of individuals who are the subject of investigations or prosecutions, and in detecting recidivist acts. It is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in both the identification and detection of individuals in criminal investigations and the identification and location of missing and unidentified persons. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the state to establish a DNA database and DNA data bank containing DNA samples submitted by persons convicted of felony offenses and other crimes as specified in RCW 43.43.754. DNA samples necessary for the identification of missing persons and unidentified human remains shall also be included in the DNA database.

The legislature further finds that the DNA identification system used by the federal bureau of investigation and the Washington state patrol has no ability to predict genetic disease or predisposal to illness. Nonetheless, the legislature intends that biological samples collected under RCW 43.43.754, and DNA identification data obtained from the samples, be used only for purposes related to criminal investigation, identification of human remains or missing persons, or improving the operation of the system authorized under RCW 43.43.752 through 43.43.758.

## 43.43.7532 - DNA identification system—DNA database account.
The state DNA database account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts under RCW 43.43.7541 must be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for creation, operation, and maintenance of the DNA database under RCW 43.43.754. Only the chief of the Washington state patrol or the chief's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

2. The Washington state patrol, in consultation with the Washington state association of sheriffs and police chiefs, shall adopt uniform state criteria for entering gangs, gang members, and gang associates into the database. Data on individuals may be entered only based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or actual criminal activity and must be supported by documentation, where documentation is available.

3.

4. The database shall provide an internet-based multiagency, multilocation, information-sharing application that operates in a network fashion.

5. The database shall be used solely as a law enforcement intelligence tool and shall not be used as evidence in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding. Law enforcement may use the information within the database to obtain information external to the database to formulate the probable cause necessary to make a stop or arrest. The mere existence of information relating to an individual within the database does not by itself justify a stop or arrest.

6. Access to the database shall be determined by the chief executive officer of each participating agency. Information about specific individuals in the database shall be automatically expunged if: (a) No new or updated information has been entered into the database within the previous five years; (b) there are no pending criminal charges against such person in any court in this state or another state or in any federal court; (c) the person has not been convicted of a new crime in this state, another state, or federal court within the last five years; and (d) it has been five years since the person completed his or her term of total confinement.

7. Each law enforcement and criminal justice agency using the database is required to:

   a. Identify a system administrator that is responsible for annually auditing the use of the system within his or her respective agency to ensure agency compliance with policies established for the use of the database;

   b. Ensure that all users of the database receive training on the use of the database before granting the users access to the database;

   c. Ensure that any information entered into the database relates to a criminal street gang associate or gang member who is twelve years old or older;

   d. Annually produce a gang threat assessment report including available data sources such as uniform crime reports, record management systems, and entries into the statewide gang database. Local public schools shall also be encouraged to provide data to the local gang threat assessment report.

8. The database and all contents in the database are confidential and exempt from public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.

9. Any public employee or public agency as defined in RCW 4.24.470, or units of local government and its employees, as provided in RCW 36.28A.010, and the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs and its employees are immune from civil liability for damages arising from incidents involving a person who has been included in the database, unless it is shown that an employee acted with gross negligence or bad faith.

## 43.43.930 - State fire protection services—Intent.
The legislature finds that fire protection services at the state level are provided by different, independent state agencies. This has resulted in a lack of a comprehensive state-level focus for state fire protection services, funding, and policy. The legislature further finds that the paramount duty of the state in fire protection services is to enhance the capacity of all local jurisdictions to assure that their personnel with fire suppression, prevention, inspection, origin and cause, and arson investigation responsibilities are adequately trained to discharge their responsibilities. It is the intent of the legislature to consolidate fire protection services into a single state agency. It is also the intent of the legislature that the fire protection services program created herein will assist local fire protection agencies in program development without encroaching upon their historic autonomy. It is the further intent of the legislature that the fire protection services program be implemented incrementally to assure a smooth transition, to build local, regional, and state capacity, and to avoid undue burdens on jurisdictions with limited resources.

          A.  In lieu of receiving training and testing services from the fire training academy, city fire departments, fire protection districts, regional fire protection service authorities, and other public fire agencies in the state may seek reimbursement for their firefighter I training expenses. The amount of reimbursement will be calculated on a per capita basis. The per capita amount is equal to the three-year statewide firefighter per capita average for the regional direct delivery of training by the fire training academy. The three-year statewide firefighter per capita average is calculated by dividing the number of firefighters trained using the regional direct delivery program during the three-year period into the total cost of providing regional direct delivery during the same three-year period.

      iii. Subject to approval by the director of fire protection, and in accordance with the plan required by this subsection (1)(e), the fire training academy facilities and programs must be made available at no cost to fire service youth programs. The goal of making these facilities and programs available is to increase enrollment of volunteer firefighters, and to improve gender, cultural, and ethnic diversity within the fire service.

      iv. For purposes of this subsection (1)(e), the following definitions apply:

          A.  "Basic firefighter training and testing" means training and testing for firefighters that is up to and includes the requirements of firefighter I, as identified by the national fire protection association standard 1001;

## 43.43.961 - State fire service mobilization—Legislative declaration and intent.
Because of the possibility of the occurrence of disastrous fires or other disasters of unprecedented size and destructiveness, the need to insure that the state is adequately prepared to respond to such a fire or disaster, the need to establish a mechanism and a procedure to provide for reimbursement to state agencies and local agencies that respond to help others in time of need or to a host fire district that experiences expenses beyond the resources of the fire district, and generally to protect the public peace, health, safety, lives, and property of the people of Washington, it is hereby declared necessary to:

1. Provide the policy and organizational structure for large scale mobilization of all risk resources in the state through creation of the Washington state fire services mobilization plan;

2. Confer upon the chief the powers provided herein;

3. Provide a means for reimbursement to state agencies and local fire jurisdictions that incur expenses when mobilized by the chief under the Washington state fire services mobilization plan; and

4. Provide for reimbursement of the host fire department or fire protection district when it has: (a) Exhausted all of its resources; and (b) invoked its local mutual aid network and exhausted those resources. Upon implementation of state fire mobilization, the host district resources shall become state fire mobilization resources consistent with the fire mobilization plan.

It is the intent of the legislature that mutual aid and other interlocal agreements providing for enhanced emergency response be encouraged as essential to the public peace, safety, health, and welfare, and for the protection of the lives and property of the people of the state of Washington. If possible, mutual aid agreements should be without stated limitations as to resources available, time, or area. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed or interpreted to limit the eligibility of any nonhost fire protection authority for reimbursement of expenses incurred in providing all risk resources for mobilization provided that the mobilization must meet the requirements identified in the Washington state fire service mobilization plan.
