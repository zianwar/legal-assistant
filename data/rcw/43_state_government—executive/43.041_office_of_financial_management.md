## 43.41.030 - Purpose.
The legislature finds that the need for long-range state program planning and for the short-range planning carried on through the budget process, complement each other. The biennial budget submitted to the legislature must be considered in the light of the longer-range plans and goals of the state. The effectiveness of the short-range plan presented as budget proposals, cannot be measured without being aware of these longer-range goals. Thus efficient management requires that the planning and fiscal activities of state government be integrated into a unified process. It is the purpose of this chapter to bring these functions together in a new division of the office of the governor to be called the office of financial management.
