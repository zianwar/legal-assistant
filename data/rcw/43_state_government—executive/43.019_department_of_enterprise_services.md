In conducting this review, the office of financial management shall:

   a. Examine the existing activities currently being performed by the department, including but not limited to an examination of services for their performance, staffing, capital requirements, and mission. Programs may be broken down into discrete services or activities or reviewed as a whole; and

      i. As part of the review in this subsection (5), the office of financial management shall select up to six activities or services that have been determined as an activity that may be provided by the private sector in a cost-effective and efficient manner, including for the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium the bulk printing services. The office of financial management may consult with affected industry stakeholders in making its decision on which activities to contract for services. Priority for selection shall be given to agency activities or services that are significant, ongoing functions.

      ii. The office of financial management must consider the consequences and potential mitigation of improper or failed performance by the contractor.

      iii. For each of the selected activities, the department shall use a request for information, request for proposal, or other procurement process to determine if a contract for the activity would result in the activity being provided at a reduced cost and with greater efficiency.

      iv. The request for information, request for proposal, or other procurement process must contain measurable standards for the performance of the contract.

      v. The department may contract with one or more vendors to provide the service as a result of the procurement process.

      vi. If the office of financial management determines via the procurement process that the activity cannot be provided by the private sector at a reduced cost and greater efficiency, the department of enterprise services may cancel the procurement without entering into a contract and shall promptly notify the legislative fiscal committees of such a decision.

      vii. The department of enterprise services, in consultation with the office of financial management, must establish a contract monitoring process to measure contract performance, costs, service delivery quality, and other contract standards, and to cancel contracts that do not meet those standards. No contracts may be renewed without a review of these measures.

      viii. The office of financial management shall prepare a biennial report summarizing the results of the examination of the agency's programs and services. In addition to the programs and services examined and the result of the examination, the report shall provide information on any procurement process that does not result in a contract for the services. During each regular legislative session held in odd-numbered years, the legislative fiscal committees shall hold a public hearing on the report and the department's activities under this section.

      ix. The joint legislative audit and review committee shall conduct an audit of the implementation of this subsection (5), and report to the legislature by January 1, 2018, on the results of the audit. The report must include an estimate of additional costs or savings to taxpayers as a result of the contracting out provisions.

## 43.19.669 - Energy conservation—Purpose.
It is the purpose of RCW 43.19.670 through 43.19.685 to require energy audits in state-owned buildings, to require energy audits as a lease condition in all new, renewed, and renegotiated leases of buildings by the state, to undertake such modifications and installations as are necessary to maximize the efficient use of energy in these buildings, including but not limited to energy management systems, and to establish a policy for the purchase of state vehicles, equipment, and materials which results in efficient energy use by the state.

For a building that is leased by the state, energy audits and implementation of cost-effective energy conservation measures are required only for that portion of the building that is leased by the state when the state leases less than one hundred percent of the building. When implementing cost-effective energy conservation measures in buildings leased by the state, those measures must generate savings sufficient to finance the building modifications and installations over a loan period not greater than ten years and allow repayment during the term of the lease.
