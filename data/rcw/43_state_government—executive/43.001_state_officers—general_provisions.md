The director of enterprise services may recover the full costs including appropriate overhead charges of the foregoing by periodic billings as determined by the director including but not limited to transfers upon accounts and advancements into the enterprise services account. Charges related to the rendering of real estate services under RCW 43.82.010 and to the operation and maintenance of public and historic facilities at the state capitol, as defined in RCW 79.24.710, shall be allocated separately from other charges assessed under this section. Rates shall be established by the director of enterprise services after consultation with the director of financial management. The director of enterprise services may allot, provide, or furnish any of such facilities, structures, services, equipment, supplies, or materials to any other public service type occupant or user at such rates or charges as are equitable and reasonably reflect the actual costs of the services provided: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the legislature, its duly constituted committees, interim committees and other committees shall be exempted from the provisions of this section.

Upon receipt of such bill, each entity, occupant, or user shall cause a warrant or check in the amount thereof to be drawn in favor of the department of enterprise services which shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the enterprise services account unless the director of financial management has authorized another method for payment of costs.

Beginning July 1, 1995, the director of enterprise services shall assess a capital projects surcharge upon each agency or other user occupying a facility owned and managed by the department of enterprise services in Thurston county, excluding state capitol public and historic facilities, as defined in RCW 79.24.710. The capital projects surcharge does not apply to agencies or users that agree to pay all future repairs, improvements, and renovations to the buildings they occupy and a proportional share, as determined by the office of financial management, of all other campus repairs, installations, improvements, and renovations that provide a benefit to the buildings they occupy or that have an agreement with the department of enterprise services that contains a charge for a similar purpose, including but not limited to RCW 43.01.091, in an amount greater than the capital projects surcharge. Beginning July 1, 2002, the capital projects surcharge does not apply to department of services for the blind vendors who operate cafeteria services in facilities owned and managed by the department of enterprise services; the department shall consider this space to be a common area for purposes of allocating the capital projects surcharge to other building tenants beginning July 1, 2003. The director, after consultation with the director of financial management, shall adopt differential capital project surcharge rates to reflect the differences in facility type and quality. The initial payment structure for this surcharge shall be one dollar per square foot per year. The surcharge shall increase over time to an amount that when combined with the facilities and service charge equals the market rate for similar types of lease space in the area or equals five dollars per square foot per year, whichever is less. The capital projects surcharge shall be in addition to other charges assessed under this section. Proceeds from the capital projects surcharge shall be deposited into the Thurston county capital facilities account created in RCW 43.19.501.

It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state of Washington that each agency or other occupant of newly constructed or substantially renovated facilities owned and operated by the department of enterprise services in Thurston county shall proportionally share the debt service costs associated with the original construction or substantial renovation of the facility. Beginning July 1, 1995, each state agency or other occupant of a facility constructed or substantially renovated after July 1, 1992, and owned and operated by the department of enterprise services in Thurston county, shall be assessed a charge to pay the principal and interest payments on any bonds or other financial contract issued to finance the construction or renovation or an equivalent charge for similar projects financed by cash sources. In recognition that full payment of debt service costs may be higher than market rates for similar types of facilities or higher than existing agreements for similar charges entered into prior to June 9, 1994, the initial charge may be less than the full cost of principal and interest payments. The charge shall be assessed to all occupants of the facility on a proportional basis based on the amount of occupied space or any unique construction requirements. The office of financial management, in consultation with the department of enterprise services, shall develop procedures to implement this section and report to the legislative fiscal committees, by October 1994, their recommendations for implementing this section. The office of financial management shall separately identify in the budget document all payments and the documentation for determining the payments required by this section for each agency and fund source during the current and the two past and future fiscal biennia. The charge authorized in this section is subject to annual audit by the state auditor.

## 43.01.240 - State agency parking account—Parking rental fees—Employee parking, limitations.
1. There is hereby established an account in the state treasury to be known as the state agency parking account. All parking income collected from the fees imposed by state agencies on parking spaces at state-owned or leased facilities, including the capitol campus, shall be deposited in the state agency parking account. Only the office of financial management may authorize expenditures from the account.

No agency may receive an allotment greater than the amount of revenue deposited into the state agency parking account.

2. An agency may, as an element of the agency's commute trip reduction program to achieve the goals set forth in RCW 70A.15.4020, impose parking rental fees at state-owned and leased properties. These fees will be deposited in the state agency parking account. Each agency shall establish a committee to advise the agency director on parking rental fees, taking into account the market rate of comparable, privately owned rental parking in each region. The agency shall solicit representation of the employee population including, but not limited to, management, administrative staff, production workers, and state employee bargaining units. Funds shall be used by agencies to: (a) Support the agencies' commute trip reduction program under RCW 70A.15.4000 through 70A.15.4100; (b) support the agencies' parking program; or (c) support the lease or ownership costs for the agencies' parking facilities.

3. In order to reduce the state's subsidization of employee parking, after July 1997 agencies shall not enter into leases for employee parking in excess of building code requirements, except as authorized by the director of enterprise services. In situations where there are fewer parking spaces than employees at a worksite, parking must be allocated equitably, with no special preference given to managers.
