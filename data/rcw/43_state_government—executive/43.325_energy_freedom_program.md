## 43.325.005 - Findings—2007 c 348.
1. The legislature finds that excessive dependence on fossil fuels jeopardizes Washington's economic security, environmental integrity, and public health. Accelerated development and use of clean fuels and clean vehicle technologies will reduce the drain on Washington's economy from importing fossil fuels. As fossil fuel prices rise, clean fuels and vehicles can save consumers money while promoting the development of a major, sustainable industry that provides good jobs and a new source of rural prosperity. In addition, clean fuels and vehicles protect public health by reducing toxic air and climate change emissions.

2. The legislature also finds that climate change is expected to have significant impacts in the Pacific Northwest region in the near and long-term future. These impacts include: Increased temperatures, declining snowpack, more frequent heavy rainfall and flooding, receding glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risks to public health due to insect and rodent-borne diseases, declining salmon populations, and increased drought and risk of forest fires. The legislature recognizes the need at this time to continue to gather and analyze information related to climate protection. This analysis will allow prudent steps to be taken to avoid, mitigate, or respond to climate impacts and protect our communities.

3. Finally, the legislature finds that to reduce fossil fuel dependence, build our clean energy economy, and reduce climate impacts, the state should develop policies and incentives that help businesses, consumers, and farmers gain greater access to affordable clean fuels and vehicles and to produce clean fuels in the state. These policies and incentives should include: Incentives for replacement of the most polluting diesel engines, especially in school buses; transitional incentives for development of the most promising in-state clean fuels and fuel feedstocks, including biodiesel crops, ethanol from plant waste, and liquid natural gas from landfill or wastewater treatment gases; reduced fossil fuel consumption by state fleets; development of promising new technologies for displacing petroleum with electricity, such as "plug-in hybrids"; and impact analysis and emission accounting procedures that prepare Washington to respond and prosper as climate change impacts occur, and as policies and markets to reduce climate pollution are developed.

## 43.325.030 - Coordinator—Duties.
The director of the department shall appoint a coordinator that is responsible for:

1. Managing, directing, inventorying, and coordinating state efforts to promote, develop, and encourage biofuel and energy efficiency, renewable energy, and innovative energy technology markets in Washington;

2. Developing, coordinating, and overseeing the implementation of a plan, or series of plans, for the production, transport, distribution, and delivery of biofuels produced predominantly from recycled products or Washington feedstocks;

3. Working with the departments of transportation and enterprise services, and other applicable state and local governmental entities and the private sector, to ensure the development of biofuel fueling stations for use by state and local governmental motor vehicle fleets, and to provide greater availability of public biofuel fueling stations for use by state and local governmental motor vehicle fleets;

4. Coordinating with the Western Washington University alternative automobile program for opportunities to support new Washington state technology for conversion of fossil fuel fleets to biofuel, hybrid, or alternative fuel propulsion;

5. Coordinating with the University of Washington's college of forest management and the Olympic natural resources center for the identification of barriers to using the state's forest resources for fuel production, including the economic and transportation barriers of physically bringing forest biomass to the market;

6. Coordinating with the department of agriculture and Washington State University for the identification of other barriers for future biofuels development and development of strategies for furthering the penetration of the Washington state fossil fuel market with Washington produced biofuels, particularly among public entities.

2. By June 1, 2015, the department shall adopt rules to define practicability and clarify how local government subdivisions of the state will be evaluated in determining whether they have met the goals set out in RCW 43.19.648(2). At a minimum, the rules must address:

   a. Criteria for determining how the goal in RCW 43.19.648(2) will be met by June 1, 2018;
