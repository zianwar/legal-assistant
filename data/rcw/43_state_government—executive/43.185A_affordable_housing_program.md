2. "Contracted amount" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 43.185.020.

3. "Department" means the department of commerce.

4. "Director" means the director of the department of commerce.

6. "Low-income household" means a single person, family or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is less than eighty percent of the median family income, adjusted for household size, for the county where the project is located.

   c. Forty percent of the loans shall go to eligible applicants operating homeownership programs for low-income households in which the households participate in the construction of their homes. Sixty percent of loans shall go to other eligible organizations. If the entire forty percent for applicants operating self-help homeownership programs cannot be lent to these types of applicants, the remainder shall be lent to other eligible organizations.

The Washington state housing finance commission shall develop guidelines for the time period in which this repayment must take place, which must be noted in the original loan agreement. The Washington state housing finance commission may grant a partial or total exemption from this repayment requirement if it determines that a development is substantially complete or that the property has been substantially used in keeping with the original affordable housing purpose of the loan. Any repayment funds received as a result of noncompliance with loan requirements shall be deposited into the Washington state housing finance commission land acquisition revolving loan fund for the purposes of the affordable housing land acquisition revolving loan fund program.

5. The Washington state housing finance commission, with approval from the department, may adopt guidelines and requirements that are necessary to administer the affordable housing land acquisition revolving loan fund program.
