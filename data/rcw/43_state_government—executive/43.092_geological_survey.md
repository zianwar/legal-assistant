## 43.92.025 - Seismic, landslide, and tsunami hazards—Assessment—Technical assistance.
1. In addition to the objectives stated in RCW 43.92.020, the geological survey must conduct and maintain an assessment of seismic, landslide, and tsunami hazards in Washington. This assessment must apply the best practicable technology, including light detection and ranging (lidar) mapping, to identify and map volcanic, seismic, landslide, and tsunami hazards, and estimate potential hazard consequences and the likelihood of a hazard occurring.

2. The geological survey must:

   a. Coordinate with state and local government agencies to compile existing data, including geological hazard maps and geotechnical reports, tending to inform geological hazard planning decisions;

   b. Acquire and process new data or update deficient data using the best practicable technology, including lidar;

   c. Create and maintain an efficient, publicly available database of lidar and geological hazard maps and geotechnical reports collected under (a) and (b) of this subsection; and

   d. Provide technical assistance to state and local government agencies on the proper interpretation and application of the results of the geological hazards assessment.

## 43.92.060 - Cooperation with federal geological survey.
The state geologist may make provisions for topographic, geologic, and hydrographic surveys of the state in cooperation with the United States geological survey in such manner as in the opinion of the state geologist will be of the greatest benefit to the agricultural, industrial, and geological requirements of the state. However, the director of the United States geological survey must first agree to expend on the part of the United States upon such surveys a sum equal to that expended by the state.
