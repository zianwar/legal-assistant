## 43.348.005 - Findings—Intent.
1. The legislature finds the following:

   a. Optimize the use of public funds by giving priority to research utilizing the best science and technology with the greatest potential to improve health outcomes;

   b. Increase the value of our public investments by leveraging our state's existing cancer research facilities and talent, as well as clinical and therapeutic resources;

   c. Incentivize additional investment by requiring private or other nonstate resources to match public funds;

   d. Protect and benefit Washington taxpayers by funding proposals for cancer research that are reviewed by an independent scientific panel;

   e. Require fiscal and public accountability through independent audits, open public meetings and hearings, and annual reports to the public; and

   f. Create jobs and encourage investments that will generate new tax revenues in our state, and advance the biotech, medical device, and health care information technology industries in Washington.
