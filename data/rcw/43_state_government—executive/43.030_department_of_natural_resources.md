Under the provisions of a cost-reimbursement agreement, funds from the applicant or proponent shall be used by the department to contract with an independent consultant to carry out the work covered by the cost-reimbursement agreement. The department may also use funds provided under a cost-reimbursement agreement to hire temporary employees, to assign current staff to review the work of the consultant, to provide necessary technical assistance when an independent consultant with comparable technical skills is unavailable, and to recover reasonable and necessary direct and indirect costs that arise from processing the permit or lease. The department shall, in developing the agreement, ensure that final decisions that involve policy matters are made by the agency and not by the consultant. The department shall make an estimate of the number of permanent staff hours to process the permits or leases, and shall contract with consultants or hire temporary employees to replace the time and functions committed by these permanent staff to the project. The billing process shall provide for accurate time and cost accounting and may include a billing cycle that provides for progress payments. 

4. The cost-reimbursement agreement must not negatively impact the processing of other permit applications. In order to maintain permit processing capacity, the agency may hire outside consultants, temporary employees, or make internal administrative changes. Consultants or temporary employees hired as part of a cost-reimbursement agreement or to maintain agency capacity are hired as agents of the state not of the permit applicant. The restrictions of chapter 42.52 RCW apply to any cost-reimbursement agreement, and to any person hired as a result of a cost-reimbursement agreement.

## 43.30.800 - Olympic natural resources center—Finding, intent.
The legislature finds that conflicts over the use of natural resources essential to the state's residents, especially forest and ocean resources, have increased dramatically. There are growing demands that these resources be fully utilized for their commodity values, while simultaneously there are increased demands for protection and preservation of these same resources. While these competing demands are most often viewed as mutually exclusive, recent research has suggested that commodity production and ecological values can be integrated. It is the intent of the legislature to foster and support the research and education necessary to provide sound scientific information on which to base sustainable forest and marine industries, and at the same time sustain the ecological values demanded by much of the public.

The purpose of the center is to demonstrate innovative management methods which successfully integrate environmental, energy, marine, and economic interests into pragmatic management of forest and ocean resources. The center shall combine research and educational opportunities with experimental forestry, oceans management, and traditional management knowledge into an overall program which demonstrates that management based on sound economic principles is made superior when combined with new methods of management based on ecological principles. The programs developed by the center shall include the following:

   a. Research and education on a broad range of ocean resources problems and opportunities in the region, such as estuarine processes, ocean and coastal management, renewable energy production, offshore development, fisheries and shellfish enhancement, and coastal business development, tourism, and recreation. In developing this component of the center's program, the center shall collaborate with coastal educational institutions such as Grays Harbor community college and Peninsula community college;

   b. Research and education on forest resources management issues on the landscape, ecosystem, or regional level, including issues that cross legal and administrative boundaries;

   c. Research and education that broadly integrates marine and terrestrial issues, including interactions of marine, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems, and that identifies options and opportunities to integrate the production of commodities with the preservation of ecological values. Where appropriate, programs shall address issues and opportunities that cross legal and administrative boundaries;

   d. Research and education on natural resources and their social and economic implications, and on alternative economic and social bases for sustainable, healthy, resource-based communities;

   e. Educational opportunities such as workshops, short courses, and continuing education for resource professionals, policy forums, information exchanges including international exchanges where appropriate, conferences, student research, and public education; and

   f. Creation of a neutral forum where parties with diverse interests are encouraged to address and resolve their conflicts.
