## 43.20B.060 - Reimbursement for medical care or residential care—Lien—Subrogation—Delegation of lien and subrogation rights.
1. To secure reimbursement of any assistance paid under chapter 74.09 RCW or reimbursement for any residential care provided by the department at a hospital for the mentally ill or habilitative care center for the developmentally disabled, as a result of injuries to or illness of a recipient caused by the negligence or wrong of another, the department shall be subrogated to the recipient's rights against a tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both.

2. The department shall have a lien upon any recovery by or on behalf of the recipient from such tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both to the extent of the value of the assistance paid or residential care provided by the department, provided that such lien shall not be effective against recoveries subject to wrongful death when there are surviving dependents of the deceased. The lien shall become effective upon filing with the county auditor in the county where the assistance was authorized or where any action is brought against the tort feasor or insurer. The lien may also be filed in any other county or served upon the recipient in the same manner as a civil summons if, in the department's discretion, such alternate filing or service is necessary to secure the department's interest. The additional lien shall be effective upon filing or service.

3. The lien of the department shall be upon any claim, right of action, settlement proceeds, money, or benefits arising from an insurance program to which the recipient might be entitled (a) against the tort feasor or insurer of the tort feasor, or both, and (b) under any contract of insurance purchased by the recipient or by any other person providing coverage for the illness or injuries for which the assistance or residential care is paid or provided by the department.

4. If recovery is made by the department under this section and the subrogation is fully or partially satisfied through an action brought by or on behalf of the recipient, the amount paid to the department shall bear its proportionate share of attorneys' fees and costs.

   a. The determination of the proportionate share to be borne by the department shall be based upon:

      i. The fees and costs approved by the court in which the action was initiated; or

      ii. The written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs when fees and costs are not addressed by the court.

   b. When fees and costs have been approved by a court, after notice to the department, the department shall have the right to be heard on the matter of attorneys' fees and costs or its proportionate share.

   c. When fees and costs have not been addressed by the court, the department shall receive at the time of settlement a copy of the written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs and may request and examine documentation of fees and costs associated with the case. The department may bring an action in superior court to void a settlement if it believes the attorneys' calculation of its proportionate share of fees and costs is inconsistent with the written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs or if the fees and costs associated with the case are exorbitant in relation to cases of a similar nature.

5. The rights and remedies provided to the department in this section to secure reimbursement for assistance, including the department's lien and subrogation rights, may be delegated to a managed health care system by contract entered into pursuant to RCW 74.09.522. A managed health care system may enforce all rights and remedies delegated to it by the department to secure and recover assistance provided under a managed health care system consistent with its agreement with the department.

## 43.20B.070 - Torts committed against recipients of state assistance—Duties of attorney representing recipient—Trust account for departmental lien.
1. An attorney representing a person who, as a result of injuries or illness sustained through the negligence or wrong of another, has received, is receiving, or has applied to receive assistance under chapter 74.09 RCW, or residential care provided by the department at a hospital for the mentally ill or habilitative care center for the developmentally disabled, shall:

   a. Notify the department at the time of filing any claim against a third party, commencing an action at law, negotiating a settlement, or accepting a settlement offer from the tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both; and

   b. Give the department thirty days' notice before any judgment, award, or settlement may be satisfied in any action or any claim by the applicant or recipient to recover damages for such injuries or illness.

2. The proceeds from any recovery made pursuant to any action or claim described in RCW 43.20B.060 that is necessary to fully satisfy the department's lien against recovery shall be placed in a trust account or in the registry of the court until the department's lien is satisfied.

## 43.20B.080 - Recovery for paid medical assistance—Rules—Disclosure of estate recovery costs, terms, and conditions.
1. The department shall file liens, seek adjustment, or otherwise effect recovery for medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396p. The department shall adopt a rule providing for prior notice and hearing rights to the record title holder or purchaser under a land sale contract.

2. Liens may be adjusted by foreclosure in accordance with chapter 61.12 RCW.

3. In the case of an individual who was fifty-five years of age or older when the individual received medical assistance, the department shall seek adjustment or recovery from the individual's estate, and from nonprobate assets of the individual as defined by RCW 11.02.005, but only for medical assistance consisting of nursing facility services, home and community-based services, other services that the department determines to be appropriate, and related hospital and prescription drug services. Recovery from the individual's estate, including foreclosure of liens imposed under this section, shall be undertaken as soon as practicable, consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396p.

## 43.20B.090 - Recovery for paid medical assistance and state-funded long-term care—Legislative intent—Legislative confirmation of effect of 1994 c 21.
1. It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that needy individuals have access to basic long-term care without requiring them to sell their homes. In the face of rising medical costs and limited funding for social welfare programs, however, the state's medicaid and state-funded long-term care programs have placed an increasing financial burden on the state. By balancing the interests of individuals with immediate and future unmet medical care needs, surviving spouses and dependent children, adult nondependent children, more distant heirs, and the state, the estate recovery provisions of RCW 43.20B.080 and 74.39A.170 provide an equitable and reasonable method of easing the state's financial burden while ensuring the continued viability of the medicaid and state-funded long-term care programs.

2. It is further the intent of the legislature to confirm that chapter 21, Laws of 1994, effective July 1, 1994, repealed and substantially reenacted the state's medicaid estate recovery laws and did not eliminate the department's authority to recover the cost of medical assistance paid prior to October 1, 1993, from the estates of deceased recipients regardless of whether they received benefits before, on, or after July 1, 1994.
