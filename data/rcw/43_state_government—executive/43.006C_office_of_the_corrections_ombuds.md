## 43.06C.005 - Intent.
The legislature intends to create an independent and impartial office of the corrections ombuds to assist in strengthening procedures and practices that lessen the possibility of actions occurring within the department of corrections that may adversely impact the health, safety, welfare, and rehabilitation of offenders, and that will effectively reduce the exposure of the department to litigation.
