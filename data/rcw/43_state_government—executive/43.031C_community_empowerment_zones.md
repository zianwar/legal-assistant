## 43.31C.005 - Findings—Declaration.
1. The legislature finds that:

   a. There are geographic areas within communities that are characterized by a lack of employment opportunities, an average income level that is below the median income level for the surrounding community, a lack of affordable housing, deteriorating infrastructure, and a lack of facilities for community services, job training, and education;

   b. Strategies to encourage reinvestment in these areas by assisting local businesses to become stronger and area residents to gain economic power involve a variety of activities and partnerships;

   c. Reinvestment in these areas cannot be accomplished with only governmental resources and require a comprehensive approach that integrates various incentives, programs, and initiatives to meet the economic, physical, and social needs of the area;

   d. Successful reinvestment depends on a local government's ability to coordinate public resources in a cohesive, comprehensive strategy that is designed to leverage long-term private investment in an area;

   e. Reinvestment can strengthen the overall tax base through increased tax revenue from expanded and new business activities and physical property improvement;

   f. Local governments, in cooperation with area residents, can provide leadership as well as planning and coordination of resources and necessary supportive services to address reinvestment in the area; and

   g. It is in the public interest to adopt a targeted approach to revitalization and enlist the resources of all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and community residents to revitalize an area.

2. The legislature declares that the purposes of the community empowerment zone act are to:

   a. Encourage reinvestment through strong partnerships and cooperation between all levels of government, community-based organizations, area residents, and the private sector;

   b. Involve the private sector and stimulate private reinvestment through the judicious use of public resources;

   c. Target governmental resources to those areas of greatest need; and

   d. Include all levels of government, community individuals, organizations, and the private sector in the policy-making process.
