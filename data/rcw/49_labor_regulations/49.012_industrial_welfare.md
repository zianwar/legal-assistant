Monetary penalties collected under this section shall be deposited into the general fund.

For the purposes of RCW 49.12.300 and 49.12.310:

## 49.12.350 - Parental leave—Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that employers often distinguish between biological parents, and adoptive parents and stepparents in their employee leave policies. Many employers who grant leave to their employees to care for a newborn child either have no policy or establish a more restrictive policy regarding whether an adoptive parent or stepparent can take similar leave. The legislature further finds that many employers establish different leave policies for men and women regarding the care of a newborn or newly placed child. The legislature recognizes that the bonding that occurs between a parent and child is important to the nurturing of that child, regardless of whether the parent is the child's biological parent and regardless of the gender of the parent. For these reasons, the legislature declares that it is the public policy of this state to require that employers who grant leave to their employees to care for a newborn child make the same leave available upon the same terms for adoptive parents and stepparents, men and women.

\[ [1989 1st ex.s. c 11 § 22](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989ex1c11.pdf?cite=1989%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2011%20§%2022); \]

## 49.12.360 - Parental leave—Discrimination prohibited.
1. An employer must grant an adoptive parent or a stepparent, at the time of birth or initial placement for adoption of a child under the age of six, the same leave under the same terms as the employer grants to biological parents. As a term of leave, an employer may restrict leave to those living with the child at the time of birth or initial placement.

2. An employer must grant the same leave upon the same terms for men as it does for women.

3. The department shall administer and investigate violations of this section. Notices of infraction, penalties, and appeals shall be administered in the same manner as violations under RCW 49.12.285.

4. For purposes of this section, "leave" means any leave from employment granted to care for a newborn or a newly adopted child at the time of placement for adoption.

5. Nothing in this section requires an employer to:

   a. Grant leave equivalent to maternity disability leave; or

   b. Establish a leave policy to care for a newborn or newly placed child if no such leave policy is in place for any of its employees.

\[ [2003 c 401 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6054-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20401%20§%204); [1989 1st ex.s. c 11 § 23](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989ex1c11.pdf?cite=1989%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2011%20§%2023); \]

## 49.12.370 - Parental leave—Collective bargaining agreement or employee benefit plan—Application.
In the case of employees covered by an unexpired collective bargaining agreement that expires on or after September 1, 1989, or by an employee benefit program or plan with a stated year ending on or after September 1, 1989, the effective date of RCW 49.12.360 shall be the later of: (1) The first day following expiration of the collective bargaining agreement; or (2) the first day of the next plan year.

## 49.12.380 - Child labor laws—Information program.
