## 49.39.005 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Bargaining representative" means any lawful organization which represents symphony musicians in their employment relations with their employers.

2. "Collective bargaining" means the performance of the mutual obligations of the employer and the exclusive bargaining representative to meet at reasonable times, to confer and negotiate in good faith, and to execute a written agreement with respect to grievance procedures and collective negotiations on personnel matters, including wages, hours, and working conditions, which may be peculiar to an appropriate bargaining unit of such employer, except that by such obligation neither party shall be compelled to agree to a proposal or be required to make a concession unless otherwise provided in this chapter.

In determining, modifying, or combining the bargaining unit, the commission shall consider the duties, skills, and working conditions of the symphony musicians; the history of collective bargaining by the symphony musicians and their bargaining representatives; the extent of organization among the symphony musicians; and the desire of the symphony musicians. The commission shall determine the bargaining representative by: (1) Comparison of signatures on organization bargaining authorization cards; or (2) conducting an election specifically therefor.

\[ [2010 c 6 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5046-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%206%20§%204); \]

## 49.39.065 - Certification of bargaining representative—Cross-check.
If only one employee organization is seeking certification as exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit for which there is no incumbent exclusive bargaining representative, the commission may determine the question concerning representation by conducting a cross-check comparing the employee organization's membership records or bargaining authorization cards against the employment records of the employer.

If an employer implements its last and best offer where there is no contract settlement, allegations that either party is violating the terms of the implemented offer are subject to grievance arbitration procedures if and as such procedures are set forth in the implemented offer, or, if not in the implemented offer, if and as such procedures are set forth in the parties' last contract.
