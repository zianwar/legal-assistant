## 49.46.005 - Declaration of necessity and police power—Conformity to modern fair labor standards.
1. Whereas the establishment of a minimum wage for employees is a subject of vital and imminent concern to the people of this state and requires appropriate action by the legislature to establish minimum standards of employment within the state of Washington, therefore the legislature declares that in its considered judgment the health, safety and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, and exercising its police power, the legislature endeavors by this chapter to establish a minimum wage for employees of this state to encourage employment opportunities within the state. The provisions of this chapter are enacted in the exercise of the police power of the state for the purpose of protecting the immediate and future health, safety and welfare of the people of this state.

2. Since the enactment of Washington's original minimum wage act, the legislature and the people have repeatedly amended this chapter to establish and enforce modern fair labor standards, including periodically updating the minimum wage and establishing the forty-hour workweek and the right to overtime pay.

3. The people hereby amend this chapter to conform to modern fair labor standards by establishing a fair minimum wage and the right to paid sick leave to protect public health and allow workers to care for the health of themselves and their families.

## 49.46.310 - Transportation network companies—Driver resource center fund—Selection of driver resource center—Intent.
1. The legislature recognizes that providing education and outreach to drivers regarding their rights and obligations furthers the state's interest in having a vibrant knowledgeable work force and safe and satisfied consumers. The legislature therefore intends to create a way of providing education, outreach, and support to workers who, because of the nature of their work, do not have access to such support through traditional avenues.

2. The driver resource center fund is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All moneys received from the remittance in RCW 49.46.300(12) must be deposited into the fund.

3. Only the director of the department of labor and industries or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the fund. The fund is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

4. The department may make expenditures from the fund for the following purposes:

   a. Services provided by the driver resource center, as defined in RCW 49.46.300, to drivers and administrative costs of providing such support. The department must distribute funding received by the account, exclusive of the department's administrative costs deducted under (b) of this subsection, to the center on a quarterly basis; and

   b. The department's costs of administering the fund and its duties under RCW 49.46.300, not to exceed 10 percent of revenues to the fund.

5. Within four months of June 9, 2022, the director of the department or the director's designee shall, through a competitive process, select and contract with a qualified nonprofit organization to be the driver resource center.

1. [Empty]

   a. If a driver files a complaint with the department alleging that a transportation network company failed to provide any compensation amounts due to the driver under RCW 49.46.300, the department shall investigate the complaint under this section. Unless otherwise resolved, the department shall issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance no later than 60 days after the date on which the department received the compensation-related complaint. The department may extend the time period by providing advance written notice to the driver and the transportation network company setting forth good cause for an extension of the time period and specifying the duration of the extension.

   b. The department may not investigate any alleged compensation-related violation that occurred more than three years before the date that the driver filed the compensation-related complaint.

   c. The department shall send the citation and notice of assessment or the determination of compliance to both the transportation network company and the driver by service of process or using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed to their last known addresses. A transportation network company may designate a mailing address of record for service, and additionally may provide an email address to which the department shall direct electronic courtesy copies of mailed correspondence, if such email address is provided.

2. If the department determines that a transportation network company has violated a compensation requirement in RCW 49.46.300 and issues to the transportation network company a citation and notice of assessment, the department may order the transportation network company to pay drivers all compensation owed, including interest of one percent per month on all compensation owed, to the driver. The compensation and interest owed must be calculated from the first date compensation was owed to the driver, except that the department may not order the transportation network company to pay any compensation and interest that were owed more than three years before the date the complaint was filed with the department.

3. If the department determines that the compensation-related violation was a willful violation, and the transportation network company fails to take corrective action, the department also may order the transportation network company to pay the department a civil penalty as specified in (a) of this subsection.

   a. A civil penalty for a willful violation shall be not less than $1,000 or an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of unpaid compensation per claimant, whichever is greater. The maximum civil penalty for a willful violation of requirements in RCW 49.46.300 shall be $20,000 per claimant.

   b. The department may not assess a civil penalty if the transportation network company reasonably relied on: (i) A rule related to any requirements in this section; (ii) a written order, ruling, approval, opinion, advice, determination, or interpretation of the director; or (iii) an interpretive or administrative policy issued by the department and filed with the office of the code reviser. In accordance with the department's retention schedule obligations under chapter 40.14 RCW, the department shall maintain a complete and accurate record of all written orders, rulings, approvals, opinions, advice, determinations, and interpretations for purposes of determining whether a transportation network company is immune from civil penalties under this subsection (3)(b).

   c. The department shall waive any civil penalty assessed against a transportation network company under this section if the transportation network company is not a repeat willful violator, and the director determines that the transportation network company has provided payment to the driver of all compensation that the department determined that the transportation network company owed to the driver, including interest, within 30 days of the transportation network company's receipt of the citation and notice of assessment from the department.

   d. The department may waive or reduce at any time a civil penalty assessed under this section if the director determines that the transportation network company paid all compensation and interest owed to a driver.

   e. The department shall deposit civil penalties paid under this section in the supplemental pension fund established under RCW 51.44.033.

4. Upon payment by a transportation network company, and acceptance by a driver, of all compensation and interest assessed by the department in a citation and notice of assessment issued to the transportation network company, the fact of such payment by the transportation network company, and of such acceptance by the driver, shall: (a) Constitute a full and complete satisfaction by the transportation network company of all specific requirements of RCW 49.46.300 addressed in the citation and notice of assessment; and (b) bar the driver from initiating or pursuing any court action or other judicial or administrative proceeding, including arbitration, based on the specific requirements addressed in the citation and notice of assessment. The citation and notice of assessment shall include a notification and summary of the specific requirements of RCW 49.46.300.

5. The applicable statute of limitations for civil actions is tolled during the department's investigation of a driver's complaint against a transportation network company. For the purposes of this subsection, the department's investigation begins on the date the driver files the complaint with the department and ends when: (a) The complaint is finally determined through a final and binding citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance; or (b) the department notifies the transportation network company and the driver in writing that the complaint has been otherwise resolved or that the driver has elected to terminate the department's administrative action under subsection (12) of this section.

6. A person, firm, or corporation aggrieved by a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance issued by the department under this section or the assessment of a civil penalty due to a determination of status as a repeat willful violator may appeal the citation and notice of assessment, the determination of compliance, or the assessment of a civil penalty to the director by filing a notice of appeal with the director within 30 days of the department's service, as provided in subsection (1) of this section, on the aggrieved party of the citation and notice of assessment, the determination of compliance, or the assessment of a civil penalty. A citation and notice of assessment, a determination of compliance, or an assessment of a civil penalty not appealed within 30 days is final and binding, and not subject to further appeal.

7. A notice of appeal filed with the director under this section shall stay the effectiveness of the citation and notice of assessment, the determination of compliance, or the assessment of a civil penalty pending final review of the appeal by the director as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW.

8. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the director shall assign the hearing to an administrative law judge of the office of administrative hearings to conduct the hearing and issue an initial order. The hearing and review procedures shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, and the standard of review by the administrative law judge of an appealed citation and notice of assessment, an appealed determination of compliance, or an appealed assessment of a civil penalty shall be de novo. Any party who seeks to challenge an initial order shall file a petition for administrative review with the director within 30 days after service of the initial order. The director shall conduct administrative review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

9. The director shall issue all final orders after appeal of the initial order. The final order of the director is subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

10. Orders that are not appealed within the time period specified in this section and chapter 34.05 RCW are final and binding, and not subject to further appeal.

11. Absent good cause, a transportation network company that fails to allow adequate inspection of records in an investigation by the department under this chapter within a reasonable time period may not use such records in any appeal under this section to challenge the correctness of any determination by the department of wages owed or penalties assessed.

12. A driver who has filed a complaint under this section with the department may elect to terminate the department's administrative action, thereby preserving any private right of action, if any exists, by providing written notice to the department within 10 business days after the driver's receipt of the department's citation and notice of assessment.

13. If the driver elects to terminate the department's administrative action: (a) The department shall immediately discontinue its action against the transportation network company; (b) the department shall vacate a citation and notice of assessment already issued by the department to the transportation network company; and (c) the citation and notice of assessment, and any related findings of fact or conclusions of law by the department, and any payment or offer of payment by the transportation network company of the compensation, including interest, assessed by the department in the citation and notice of assessment, shall not be admissible in any court action or other judicial or administrative proceeding.

14. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or affect: (a) The right of any driver to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to a transportation network company; (b) the right of the department to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to a driver that is identified as a result of a complaint for a violation of RCW 49.46.300; or (c) the right of the department to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to a transportation network company in the absence of a complaint for a violation of RCW 49.46.300. For purposes of this subsection, "driver" means a driver other than a driver who has filed a complaint with the department and who thereafter has elected to terminate the department's administrative action as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

15. After a final order is issued under this section, and served as provided in subsection (1) of this section, if a transportation network company defaults in the payment of: (a) Any compensation determined by the department to be owed to a driver, including interest; or (b) any civil penalty ordered by the department under this section, the director may file with the clerk of any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the payment plus any filing fees. The clerk of the county in which the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for the warrant, and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the transportation network company mentioned in the warrant, the amount of payment due plus any filing fees, and the date when the warrant was filed. The aggregate amount of the warrant as docketed becomes a lien upon the title to, and interest in, all real and personal property of the transportation network company against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case docketed with the superior court clerk. The sheriff shall proceed upon the warrant in all respects and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. The warrant so docketed is sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the state in a manner provided by law in case of judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court is entitled to a filing fee which will be added to the amount of the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be served on the transportation network company, as provided in subsection (1) of this section, within three days of filing with the clerk.

    a. The director may issue to any person, firm, corporation, other entity, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or any agency of the state, a notice and order to withhold and deliver property of any kind when he or she has reason to believe that there is in the possession of the person, firm, corporation, other entity, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, property that is or will become due, owing, or belonging to a transportation network company upon whom a notice of assessment has been served by the department for payments or civil penalties due to the department. The effect of a notice and order is continuous from the date the notice and order is first made until the liability out of which the notice and order arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable because of lapse of time. The department shall release the notice and order when the liability out of which the notice and order arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time and shall notify the person against whom the notice and order was made that the notice and order has been released.

    b. The notice and order to withhold and deliver must be served by the sheriff of the county or by the sheriff's deputy, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by the director. A person, firm, corporation, other entity, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state upon whom service has been made shall answer the notice within 20 days exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of in the notice and order. Upon service of the notice and order, if the party served possesses any property that may be subject to the claim of the department, the party shall promptly deliver the property to the director. The director shall hold the property in trust for application on the transportation network company's indebtedness to the department, or for return without interest, in accordance with a final determination of a petition for review. In the alternative, the party shall furnish a good and sufficient surety bond satisfactory to the director conditioned upon final determination of liability. If a party served and named in the notice fails to answer the notice within the time prescribed in this section, the court may render judgment by default against the party for the full amount claimed by the director in the notice, together with costs. If a notice is served upon a transportation network company and the property subject to it is compensation, the transportation network company may assert in the answer all exemptions provided for by chapter 6.27 RCW to which the compensation earner is entitled.

    c. As an alternative to the methods of service described in this section, the department may electronically serve a financial institution with a notice and order to withhold and deliver by providing a list of its outstanding warrants, except those for which a payment agreement is in good standing, to the department of revenue. The department of revenue may include the warrants provided by the department in a notice and order to withhold and deliver served under RCW 82.32.235(3). A financial institution that is served with a notice and order to withhold and deliver under this subsection (16)(c) must answer the notice within the time period applicable to service under RCW 82.32.235(3). The department and the department of revenue may adopt rules to implement this subsection (16)(c).

17. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the procedure for collection of compensation owed, including interest, and civil penalties as set forth in this section, the department may recover compensation owed, including interest, and civil penalties assessed under RCW 49.48.083 in a civil action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction of the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred.

    b. The department may use the procedures under this section to foreclose compensation liens established under chapter 60.90 RCW. When the department is foreclosing on a compensation lien, the date the compensation lien was originally filed shall be the date by which priority is determined, regardless of the date the warrant is filed under this section.

18. Whenever any transportation network company quits business, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the transportation network company's business or stock of goods, any person who becomes a successor to the business becomes liable for the full amount of any outstanding citation and notice of assessment or penalty against the transportation network company's business under this chapter if, at the time of the conveyance of the business, the successor has: (a) Actual knowledge of the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment; or (b) a prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment from the department. If the citation and notice of assessment or penalty is not paid in full by the transportation network company within 10 days of the date of the sale, exchange, or disposal, the successor is liable for the payment of the full amount of the citation and notice of assessment or penalty, and payment thereof by the successor must, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If the payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference becomes a debt due the successor from the transportation network company.

19. This section does not affect other collection remedies that are otherwise provided by law.

## 49.46.340 - Transportation network companies—Unlawful practices—Retaliation—Penalties—Request for reconsideration—Appeals.
1. It is unlawful for a transportation network company to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any driver right provided under or in connection with RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5). This means a transportation network company may not use a driver's exercise of any of the rights provided under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5) as a factor in any action that adversely affects the driver's use of the transportation network.

2. It is unlawful for a transportation network company to adopt or enforce any policy that counts the use of earned paid sick time for a purpose authorized under RCW 49.46.210(1) (b) and (c) as time off the platform that may lead to or result in temporary or permanent deactivation by the transportation network company against the driver.

3. It is unlawful for a transportation network company to take any adverse action against a driver because the driver has exercised their rights provided under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5). Such rights include, but are not limited to: Filing an action, or instituting or causing to be instituted any proceeding under or related to RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5), or testifying or intending to testify in any such proceeding related to any rights provided under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5).

4. Adverse action means any action taken or threatened by a transportation network company against a driver for the driver's exercise of rights under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5).

5. A driver who believes that he or she was subject to retaliation by a transportation network company for the exercise of any driver right under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5) may file a complaint with the department within 180 days of the alleged retaliatory action. The department may, at its discretion, extend the 180-day period on recognized equitable principles or because of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the department. The department may extend the 180-day period when there is a preponderance of evidence that the transportation network company has concealed or misled the driver regarding the alleged retaliatory action.

6. If a driver files a timely complaint with the department alleging retaliation, the department shall investigate the complaint and issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance within 90 days after the date on which the department received the complaint, unless the complaint is otherwise resolved. The department may extend the period by providing advance written notice to the driver and the transportation network company setting forth good cause for an extension of the period, and specifying the duration of the extension.

7. The department may consider a complaint to be otherwise resolved when the driver and the transportation network company reach a mutual agreement to remedy any retaliatory action, or the driver voluntarily and on the driver's own initiative withdraws the complaint.

8. If the department's investigation finds that the driver's allegation of retaliation cannot be substantiated, the department shall issue a determination of compliance to the driver and the transportation network company detailing such finding.

9. If the department's investigation finds that the transportation network company retaliated against the driver, and the complaint is not otherwise resolved, the department may, at its discretion, notify the transportation network company that the department intends to issue a citation and notice of assessment, and may provide up to 30 days after the date of such notification for the transportation network company to take corrective action to remedy the retaliatory action. If the complaint is not otherwise resolved, then the department shall issue a citation and notice of assessment. The department's citation and notice of assessment may:

   a. Order the transportation network company to make payable to the driver earnings that the driver did not receive due to the transportation network company's retaliatory action, including interest of one percent per month on all earnings owed. The earnings and interest owed will be calculated from the first date earnings were owed to the driver;

   b. Order the transportation network company to restore the contract of the driver, unless otherwise prohibited by law;

   c. Order the transportation network company to cease using any policy that counts the use of earned paid sick time as time off the platform or an adverse action against the driver;

   d. For the first violation, order the transportation network company to pay the department a civil penalty established in subsection (15) of this section; and

   e. For a repeat violation, order the transportation network company to pay the department up to double the civil penalty established in subsection (15) of this section.

10. The department shall send the citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance to both the transportation network company and driver by service of process or using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed to their last known addresses. A transportation network company may designate a mailing address of record for service, and additionally may provide an email address to which the department shall direct electronic courtesy copies of mailed correspondence, if such email address is provided.

11. During an investigation of the driver's retaliation complaint, if the department discovers information suggesting alleged violations by the transportation network company of the driver's other rights under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may investigate and take appropriate enforcement action without requiring the driver to file a new or separate complaint. In the event the department so expands an investigation, it shall provide reasonable notice to the transportation network company that it is doing so. If the department determines that the transportation network company violated additional rights of the driver under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the transportation network company may be subject to additional enforcement actions for the violation of such rights. If the department discovers information alleging the transportation network company retaliated against or otherwise violated rights of other drivers under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may launch further investigation under this chapter, and all applicable rules, without requiring additional complaints to be filed.

12. The department may prioritize retaliation investigations as needed to allow for timely resolution of complaints.

13. Nothing in this section impedes the department's ability to investigate under the authority prescribed in RCW 49.48.040.

14. Nothing in this section precludes a driver's right to pursue private legal action, if any exists.

15. If the department's investigation finds that a transportation network company retaliated against a driver, pursuant to the procedures outlined in this section, the department may order the transportation network company to pay the department a civil penalty.

## 49.46.350 - Transportation network companies—Paid sick time—Department investigation—Notice of assessment—Rules.
1. If a driver files a complaint with the department alleging that the transportation network company failed to provide the driver with earned paid sick time as provided in RCW 49.46.210, the department shall investigate the complaint as an alleged violation of a compensation-related requirement of RCW 49.46.300.

2. When the department's investigation results in a finding that the transportation network company failed to provide the driver with earned paid sick time accrual, use, or carryover during an ongoing contractual relationship, the driver may elect to:

   a. Receive full access to the balance of accrued earned paid sick time hours unlawfully withheld by the transportation network company, based on a calculation of one hour of earned paid sick time for every 40 hours of passenger platform time worked; or

   b. Receive payment from the transportation network company at their average hourly compensation for each hour of earned paid sick time that the driver would have used or been reasonably expected to use, whichever is greater, during the period of noncompliance, not to exceed an amount the driver would have otherwise accrued. The driver will receive full access to the balance of accrued earned paid sick time unlawfully withheld by the transportation network company, less the number of earned paid sick time paid out to the driver pursuant to this subsection.

3. For a driver whose contract with the transportation network company is terminated or who has not recorded passenger platform time on the transportation network company's driver platform for 365 days or more, when the department's investigation results in a finding that the transportation network company failed to provide the driver with earned paid sick time accrual, use, or carryover, the driver may elect to receive payment at their average hourly compensation for earned paid sick time that the driver would have earned or been reasonably expected to use, whichever is greater, during the period of noncompliance, receive reinstatement of the balance of earned paid sick time, or receive a combination of payment and reinstatement from the transportation network company for all earned paid sick time that would have accrued during the period of noncompliance, unless such reinstatement is prohibited by law.

4. The department's notice of assessment, pursuant to RCW 49.48.083, may order the transportation network company to provide the driver any combination of reinstatement and payment of accrued, unused earned paid sick time assessed pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section, unless such reinstatement is prohibited by law.

5. For purposes of this section, a transportation network company found to be in noncompliance cannot cap the driver's carryover of earned paid sick time at 40 hours to the following year for each year of noncompliance.

6. The department may promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with this section.
