## 49.74.005 - Legislative findings—Purpose.
Discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, marital status, or the presence of any disability is contrary to the findings of the legislature and public policy. The legislature finds and declares that racial minorities, women, persons in protected age groups, persons with disabilities, Vietnam-era veterans, and veterans with disabilities are underrepresented in Washington state government employment.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for enforcement measures for affirmative action within Washington state government employment and institutions of higher education in order to eliminate such underrepresentation.
