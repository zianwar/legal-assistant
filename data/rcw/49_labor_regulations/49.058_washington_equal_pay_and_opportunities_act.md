## 49.58.005 - Findings—Intent.
1. The legislature finds that despite existing equal pay laws, there continues to be a gap in wages and advancement opportunities among workers in Washington, especially women. Income disparities limit the ability of women to provide for their families, leading to higher rates of poverty among women and children. The legislature finds that in order to promote fairness among workers, employees must be compensated equitably. Further, policies that encourage retaliation or discipline towards workers who discuss or inquire about compensation prevent workers from moving forward.

2. The legislature intends to update the existing Washington state equal pay act, not modified since 1943, to address income disparities, employer discrimination, and retaliation practices, and to reflect the equal status of all workers in Washington state.

3. The legislature finds that:

   a. The long-held business practice of inquiring about salary history has contributed to persistent earning inequalities;

   b. Historically, women have been offered lower initial pay than men for the same jobs even where their levels of education and experience are the same or comparable; and

   c. Lower starting salaries translate into lower pay, less family income, and more children and families in poverty.

4. The legislature therefore intends to follow multiple other states and take the additional step towards gender equality by prohibiting an employer from seeking the wage or salary history of an applicant for employment in certain circumstances. Further, the legislature intends to require an employer to provide wage and salary information to applicants and employees.

## 49.58.020 - Wage discrimination due to gender prohibited—Penalty—Civil recovery.
1. Any employer in this state who discriminates in any way in providing compensation based on gender between similarly employed employees of the employer is guilty of a misdemeanor. If any employee receives less compensation because of discrimination on account of gender in violation of this section, that employee is entitled to the remedies in RCW 49.58.060 and 49.58.070. In such action, however, the employer shall be credited with any compensation which has been paid to the employee upon account.

2. For purposes of this section, employees are similarly employed if the individuals work for the same employer, the performance of the job requires similar skill, effort, and responsibility, and the jobs are performed under similar working conditions. Job titles alone are not determinative of whether employees are similarly employed.

3. [Empty]

   a. Discrimination within the meaning of this section does not include a differential in compensation based in good faith on a bona fide job-related factor or factors that:

      i. Are consistent with business necessity;

      ii. Are not based on or derived from a gender-based differential; and

      iii. Account for the entire differential. More than one factor may account for the differential.

   b. Such bona fide factors include, but are not limited to:

      i. Education, training, or experience;

      ii. A seniority system;

      iii. A merit system;

      iv. A system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or

      v. A bona fide regional difference in compensation levels.

   c. A differential in compensation based in good faith on a local government ordinance providing for a minimum wage different from state law does not constitute discrimination under this section.

   d. An individual's previous wage or salary history is not a defense under this section.

   e. The employer carries the burden of proof on these defenses.

## 49.58.030 - Finding—When career advancement limited by gender—Remedies—Complaint—Penalties.
1. The legislature finds that equality of opportunity for advancement is key to reducing income disparities based on gender. The legislature further finds that using gender as a factor in advancement contributes to pay inequity.

2. An employer may not, on the basis of gender, limit or deprive an employee of career advancement opportunities that would otherwise be available.

3. A differential in career advancement based on a bona fide job-related factor or factors that meet the criteria in RCW 49.58.020(3)(a) (i) through (iii) does not constitute discrimination within the meaning of this section. Such bona fide factors include, but are not limited to, the factors specified in RCW 49.58.020(3)(b) (i) through (iv).

4. [Empty]

   a.

   b. Upon complaint by an employee, the director must investigate to determine if there has been compliance with this section and the rules adopted to implement this section.

      i. For a first violation, the civil penalty may not exceed five hundred dollars.

An employer may not retaliate, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed any complaint, or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under this chapter, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding, or because of the exercise by such employee on behalf of himself or herself or others of any right afforded by this chapter.

\[ [2018 c 116 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1506-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%20116%20§%206); \]
