## 49.44.090 - Unfair practices in employment because of age of employee or applicant—Exceptions.
It shall be an unfair practice:

1. For an employer or licensing agency, because an individual is forty years of age or older, to refuse to hire or employ or license or to bar or to terminate from employment such individual, or to discriminate against such individual in promotion, compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment: PROVIDED, That employers or licensing agencies may establish reasonable minimum and/or maximum age limits with respect to candidates for positions of employment, which positions are of such a nature as to require extraordinary physical effort, endurance, condition or training, subject to the approval of the executive director of the Washington state human rights commission or the director of labor and industries through the division of industrial relations.

For any employer, licensing agency or employment agency to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement, or publication, or to use any form of application for employment or to make any inquiry in connection with prospective employment, which expresses any limitation, specification or discrimination respecting individuals forty years of age or older: PROVIDED, That nothing herein shall forbid a requirement of disclosure of birthdate upon any form of application for employment or by the production of a birth certificate or other sufficient evidence of the applicant's true age after an employee is hired.

Nothing contained in this section or in RCW 49.60.180 as to age shall be construed to prevent the termination of the employment of any person who is physically unable to perform his or her duties or to affect the retirement policy or system of any employer where such policy or system is not merely a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this section; nor shall anything in this section or in RCW 49.60.180 be deemed to preclude the varying of insurance coverages according to an employee's age; nor shall this section be construed as applying to any state, county, or city law enforcement agencies, or as superseding any law fixing or authorizing the establishment of reasonable minimum or maximum age limits with respect to candidates for certain positions in public employment which are of such a nature as to require extraordinary physical effort, or which for other reasons warrant consideration of age factors.

## 49.44.140 - Requiring assignment of employee's rights to inventions—Conditions.
1. A provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee's rights in an invention to the employer does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) directly to the business of the employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work performed by the employee for the employer. Any provision which purports to apply to such an invention is to that extent against the public policy of this state and is to that extent void and unenforceable.

2. An employer shall not require a provision made void and unenforceable by subsection (1) of this section as a condition of employment or continuing employment.

3. If an employment agreement entered into after September 1, 1979, contains a provision requiring the employee to assign any of the employee's rights in any invention to the employer, the employer must also, at the time the agreement is made, provide a written notification to the employee that the agreement does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) directly to the business of the employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work preformed [performed] by the employee for the employer.

## 49.44.150 - Requiring assignment of employee's rights to inventions—Disclosure of inventions by employee.
Even though the employee meets the burden of proving the conditions specified in RCW 49.44.140, the employee shall, at the time of employment or thereafter, disclose all inventions being developed by the employee, for the purpose of determining employer or employee rights. The employer or the employee may disclose such inventions to the department of employment security, and the department shall maintain a record of such disclosures for a minimum period of five years.

\[ [1979 ex.s. c 177 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c177.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%20177%20§%203); \]

## 49.44.160 - Public employers—Intent.
The legislature intends that public employers be prohibited from misclassifying employees, or taking other action to avoid providing or continuing to provide employment-based benefits to which employees are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification.

Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not mandate that any public employer provide benefits to actual temporary, seasonal, or part-time employees beyond the benefits to which they are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification. Public employers may determine eligibility rules for their own benefit plans and may exclude categories of workers such as "temporary" or "seasonal," so long as the definitions and eligibility rules are objective and applied on a consistent basis. Objective standards, such as control over the work and the length of the employment relationship, should determine whether a person is an employee who is entitled to employee benefits, rather than the arbitrary application of labels, such as "temporary" or "contractor." Common law standards should be used to determine whether a person is performing services as an employee, as a contractor, or as part of an agency relationship.

Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not modify any statute or policy regarding the employment of: Public employee retirees who are hired for postretirement employment as provided for in chapter 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, or 41.40 RCW or who work as contractors; or enrolled students who receive employment as student employees or as part of their education or financial aid.

\[ [2002 c 155 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5264-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20155%20§%201); \]

## 49.44.170 - Public employers—Unfair practices—Definitions—Remedies.
1. It is an unfair practice for any public employer to:

   a. Misclassify any employee to avoid providing or continuing to provide employment-based benefits; or

   b. Include any other language in a contract with an employee that requires the employee to forgo employment-based benefits.

2. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout chapter 155, Laws of 2002 unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Employee" means a person who is providing services for compensation to an employer, unless the person is free from the employer's direction and control over the performance of work. This definition shall be interpreted consistent with common law.

   b. "Employment-based benefits" means any benefits to which employees are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification.

   c. "Public employer" means: (i) Any unit of local government including, but not limited to, a county, city, town, municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, or political subdivision; and (ii) the state, state institutions, and state agencies. This definition shall be interpreted consistent with common law.

   d. "Misclassify" and "misclassification" means to incorrectly classify or label a long-term public employee as "temporary," "leased," "contract," "seasonal," "intermittent," or "part-time," or to use a similar label that does not objectively describe the employee's actual work circumstances.

3. An employee deeming himself or herself harmed in violation of subsection (1) of this section may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

\[ [2002 c 155 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5264-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20155%20§%202); \]

## 49.44.180 - Genetic screening.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, or the state of Washington, its political subdivisions, or municipal corporations to require, directly or indirectly, that any employee or prospective employee submit genetic information or submit to screening for genetic information as a condition of employment or continued employment.

"Genetic information" for purposes of this chapter, is information about inherited characteristics that can be derived from a DNA-based or other laboratory test, family history, or medical examination. "Genetic information" for purposes of this chapter, does not include: (1) Routine physical measurements, including chemical, blood, and urine analysis, unless conducted purposefully to diagnose genetic or inherited characteristics; and (2) results from tests for abuse of alcohol or drugs.

\[ [2020 c 76 § 18](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1551-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%2076%20§%2018); [2004 c 12 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6180.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%2012%20§%201); \]

## 49.44.190 - Noncompetition agreements for broadcasting industry employees—Restrictions—Trade secrets protected.
1. If an employee subject to an employee noncompetition agreement is terminated without just cause or laid off by action of the employer, the noncompetition agreement is void and unenforceable.

2. Nothing in this section restricts the right of an employer to protect trade secrets or other proprietary information by lawful means in equity or under applicable law.

3. Nothing in this section has the effect of terminating, or in any way modifying, any rights or liabilities resulting from an employee noncompetition agreement that was entered into before December 31, 2005.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Employee" means an employee of a broadcasting industry employer other than a sales or management employee.

   b. "Employer" means any person, firm, corporation, partnership, business trust, legal representative, or other entity which engages in any business, industry, profession, or activity in this state and employs one or more employees, and includes the state, counties, cities, and all municipal corporations, public corporations, political subdivisions of the state, and charitable organizations.

   c. "Employee noncompetition agreement" means an agreement, written or oral, express or implied, between an employer and employee under which the employee agrees not to compete, either alone or as an employee of another, with the employer in providing services after termination of employment.

   d. "Broadcasting industry" means employers that distribute or transmit electronic signals to the public at large using television (VHF or UHF), radio (AM, FM, or satellite), or cable television technologies, or which prepare, develop, or create programs or messages to be transmitted by electronic signal using television, radio, or cable technology.

## 49.44.200 - Personal social networking accounts—Restrictions on employer access—Definitions.

   a. Request, require, or otherwise coerce an employee or applicant to disclose login information for the employee's or applicant's personal social networking account;
