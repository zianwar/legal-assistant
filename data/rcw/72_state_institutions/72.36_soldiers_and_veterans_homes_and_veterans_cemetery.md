The legislature also finds that it is important to maintain the dignity and self-respect of residents of veterans' homes, by providing for continued resident involvement in the homes' operation, and through retention of current law guaranteeing a minimum amount of allowable personal income necessary to meet the greater costs for these residents of transportation, communication, and participation in family and community activities that are vitally important to their maintenance and rehabilitation.
