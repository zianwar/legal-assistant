One trustee shall be a resident and qualified elector from each of the state's congressional districts.

The board of trustees shall organize itself by electing a chair from its members. The board shall adopt a seal and may adopt such bylaws, rules, and regulations as it deems necessary for its own government. A majority of the voting members of the board in office shall constitute a quorum, but a lesser number may convene from time to time and may compel the attendance of absent members in such manner as prescribed in its bylaws, rules, or regulations. The superintendent of the state school for the blind shall serve as, or may designate another person to serve as, the secretary of the board, who shall not be deemed to be a member of the board.
