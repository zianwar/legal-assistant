## 72.09.010 - Legislative intent.
It is the intent of the legislature to establish a comprehensive system of corrections for convicted law violators within the state of Washington to accomplish the following objectives.

1. The system should ensure the public safety. The system should be designed and managed to provide the maximum feasible safety for the persons and property of the general public, the staff, and the inmates.

2. The system should punish the offender for violating the laws of the state of Washington. This punishment should generally be limited to the denial of liberty of the offender.

3. The system should positively impact offenders by stressing personal responsibility and accountability and by discouraging recidivism.

4. The system should treat all offenders fairly and equitably without regard to race, religion, sex, national origin, residence, or social condition.

5. The system, as much as possible, should reflect the values of the community including:

   a. Avoiding idleness. Idleness is not only wasteful but destructive to the individual and to the community.

   b. Adoption of the work ethic. It is the community expectation that all individuals should work and through their efforts benefit both themselves and the community.

   c. Providing opportunities for self improvement. All individuals should have opportunities to grow and expand their skills and abilities so as to fulfill their role in the community.

   d. Linking the receipt or denial of privileges to responsible behavior and accomplishments. The individual who works to improve himself or herself and the community should be rewarded for these efforts. As a corollary, there should be no rewards for no effort.

   e. Sharing in the obligations of the community. All citizens, the public and inmates alike, have a personal and fiscal obligation in the corrections system. All communities must share in the responsibility of the corrections system.

6. The system should provide for prudent management of resources. The avoidance of unnecessary or inefficient public expenditures on the part of offenders and the department is essential. Offenders must be accountable to the department, and the department to the public and the legislature. The human and fiscal resources of the community are limited. The management and use of these resources can be enhanced by wise investment, productive programs, the reduction of duplication and waste, and the joining together of all involved parties in a common endeavor. Since most offenders return to the community, it is wise for the state and the communities to make an investment in effective rehabilitation programs for offenders and the wise use of resources.

7. The system should provide for restitution. Those who have damaged others, persons or property, have a responsibility to make restitution for these damages.

8. The system should be accountable to the citizens of the state. In return, the individual citizens and local units of government must meet their responsibilities to make the corrections system effective.

9. The system should meet those national standards which the state determines to be appropriate.

## 72.09.100 - Inmate work program—Classes of work programs—Participation—Benefits.
It is the intent of the legislature to vest in the department the power to provide for a comprehensive inmate work program and to remove statutory and other restrictions which have limited work programs in the past. It is also the intent of the legislature to ensure that the department, in developing and selecting correctional industries work programs, does not encourage the development of, or provide for selection of or contracting for, or the significant expansion of, any new or existing class I correctional industries work programs that unfairly compete with Washington businesses. The legislature intends that the requirements relating to fair competition in the correctional industries work programs be liberally construed by the department to protect Washington businesses from unfair competition. For purposes of establishing such a comprehensive program, the legislature recommends that the department consider adopting any or all, or any variation of, the following classes of work programs:

1. CLASS I: FREE VENTURE INDUSTRIES.

   c. The department shall review these proposed industries, including any potential new class I industries work program or the significant expansion of an existing class I industries work program, before the department contracts to provide such products or services. The review shall include the analysis required under RCW 72.09.115 to determine if the proposed correctional industries work program will compete with any Washington business. An agreement for a new class I correctional industries work program, or an agreement for a significant expansion of an existing class I correctional industries work program, that unfairly competes with any Washington business is prohibited.

   d. The department shall supply appropriate security and custody services without charge to the participating firms.

   e. Inmates who work in free venture industries shall do so at their own choice. They shall be paid a wage comparable to the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located, as determined by the director of correctional industries. If the director cannot reasonably determine the comparable wage, then the pay shall not be less than the federal minimum wage.

   f. An inmate who is employed in the class I program of correctional industries shall not be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to any of the provisions of Title 50 RCW until released on parole or discharged.

2. CLASS II: TAX REDUCTION INDUSTRIES.

          E.  A person under the supervision of the department and his or her immediate family members; and

          F.  A licensed health professional for the sole purpose of providing eyeglasses to enrollees of the state medical program at no more than the health professional's cost of acquisition.

      iv. It is prohibited to purchase any item purchased under (b)(ii)(D) and (E) of this subsection for the purpose of resale.

      v. Clothing manufactured by an industry in this class may be donated to nonprofit organizations that provide clothing free of charge to low-income persons.

To avoid waste or spoilage and consequent loss to the state, when there is no public sector market for such goods, by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural, and animal husbandry enterprises may be sold to private persons, at private sale. Surplus by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises that cannot be sold to public agencies or to private persons may be donated to nonprofit organizations. All sales of surplus products shall be carried out in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary.

   e. Security and custody services shall be provided without charge by the department.

   f. Inmates working in this class of industries shall do so at their own choice and shall be paid for their work on a gratuity scale which shall not exceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located and which is approved by the director of correctional industries.

   g. Provisions of RCW 41.06.142 shall not apply to contracts with Washington state businesses entered into by the department through class II industries.

3. CLASS III: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT INDUSTRIES.

   a. Industries in this class shall be operated by the department. They shall be designed and managed to accomplish the following objectives:

      i. Whenever possible, to provide basic work training and experience so that the inmate will be able to qualify for better work both within correctional industries and the free community.

      ii. Whenever possible, to provide forty hours of work or work training per week.

      iii. Whenever possible, to offset tax and other public support costs.

   b. Class III correctional industries shall be reviewed by the department to set policy for work crews. The department shall prepare quarterly detail statements showing where work crews worked, what correctional industry class, and the hours worked.

4. CLASS IV: COMMUNITY WORK INDUSTRIES.

   a. Industries in this class shall be operated by the department. They shall be designed and managed to provide services in the inmate's resident community at a reduced cost. The services shall be provided to public agencies, to persons who are poor or infirm, or to nonprofit organizations.

   b. Class IV correctional industries shall be reviewed by the department to set policy for work crews. The department shall prepare quarterly detail statements showing where work crews worked, what correctional industry class, and the hours worked.

5. CLASS V: COMMUNITY RESTITUTION PROGRAMS.

## 72.09.115 - Proposed new class I correctional industries work program—Threshold analysis—Business impact analysis—Public hearing—Finding.
1. The department must prepare a threshold analysis for any proposed new class I correctional industries work program or the significant expansion of an existing class I correctional industries work program before the department enters into an agreement to provide such products or services. The analysis must state whether the proposed new or expanded program will impact any Washington business and must be based on information sufficient to evaluate the impact on Washington business.

2. If the threshold analysis determines that a proposed new or expanded class I correctional industries work program will impact a Washington business, the department must complete a business impact analysis before the department enters into an agreement to provide such products or services. The business impact analysis must include:

   a. A detailed statement identifying the scope and types of impacts caused by the proposed new or expanded correctional industries work program on Washington businesses; and

   b. A detailed statement of the business costs of the proposed correctional industries work program compared to the business costs of the Washington businesses that may be impacted by the proposed class I correctional industries work program. Business costs of the proposed correctional industries work program include rent, water, sewer, electricity, disposal, labor costs, and any other quantifiable expense unique to operating in a prison. Business costs of the impacted Washington business include rent, water, sewer, electricity, disposal, property taxes, and labor costs including employee taxes, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation.

3. The completed threshold analysis and any completed business impact analysis with all supporting documents must be shared in a meaningful and timely manner with local chambers of commerce, trade or business associations, local and state labor union organizations, and government entities before a finding required under subsection (4) of this section is made on the proposed new or expanded class I correctional industries work program.

4. If a business impact analysis is completed, the department must conduct a public hearing to take public testimony on the business impact analysis. The department must, at a minimum, establish a publicly accessible website containing information reasonably calculated to provide notice to each Washington business assigned the same three-digit standard industrial classification code, or the corresponding North American industry classification system code, as the organization seeking the class I correctional industries work program agreement of the date, time, and place of the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be posted at least thirty days prior to the hearing.

5. Following the public hearing, the department shall adopt a finding that the proposed new or expanded class I correctional industries work program: (a) Will not compete with any Washington business; (b) will not compete unfairly with any Washington business; or (c) will compete unfairly with any Washington business and is therefore prohibited under chapter 167, Laws of 2004.

## 72.09.130 - Incentive system for participation in education and work programs—Rules—Dissemination.
1. The department shall adopt, by rule, a system that clearly links an inmate's behavior and participation in available education and work programs with the receipt or denial of earned early release days and other privileges. The system shall include increases or decreases in the degree of liberty granted the inmate within the programs operated by the department, access to or withholding of privileges available within correctional institutions, and recommended increases or decreases in the number of earned early release days that an inmate can earn for good conduct and good performance.

2. Earned early release days shall be recommended by the department as a reward for accomplishment. The system shall be fair, measurable, and understandable to offenders, staff, and the public. At least once in each twelve-month period, the department shall inform the offender in writing as to his or her conduct and performance. This written evaluation shall include reasons for awarding or not awarding recommended earned early release days for good conduct and good performance. An inmate is not eligible to receive earned early release days during any time in which he or she refuses to participate in an available education or work program into which he or she has been placed under RCW 72.09.460.

Victims, witnesses, and other interested people notified by the department may provide information and comments to the department on potential safety risk to specific individuals or classes of individuals posed by the specific person. The team may recommend: (a) That the person be evaluated by a designated crisis responder, as defined in chapter 71.05 RCW; (b) department-supervised community treatment; or (c) voluntary community mental health or substance use disorder or abuse treatment.

3. Prior to release of a person identified under this section, the team shall determine whether or not an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is needed. If an evaluation is recommended, the supporting documentation shall be immediately forwarded to the appropriate designated crisis responder. The supporting documentation shall include the person's criminal history, history of judicially required or administratively ordered involuntary antipsychotic medication while in confinement, and any known history of involuntary civil commitment.

4. If an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is recommended by the team, such evaluation shall occur not more than ten days, nor less than five days, prior to release.

5. A second evaluation by a designated crisis responder shall occur on the day of release if requested by the team, based upon new information or a change in the person's mental condition, and the initial evaluation did not result in an emergency detention or a summons under chapter 71.05 RCW.

6. If the designated crisis responder determines an emergency detention under chapter 71.05 RCW is necessary, the department shall release the person only to a state hospital or to a consenting evaluation and treatment facility or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility. The department shall arrange transportation of the person to the hospital or facility.

7. If the designated crisis responder believes that a less restrictive alternative treatment is appropriate, he or she shall seek a summons, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 71.05 RCW, to require the person to appear at an evaluation and treatment facility or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility. If a summons is issued, the person shall remain within the corrections facility until completion of his or her term of confinement and be transported, by corrections personnel on the day of completion, directly to the identified facility.

8. The secretary shall adopt rules to implement this section.

## 72.09.400 - Work ethic camp program—Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that high crime rates and a heightened sense of vulnerability have led to increased public pressure on criminal justice officials to increase offender punishment and remove the most dangerous criminals from the streets. As a result, there is unprecedented growth in the corrections populations and overcrowding of prisons and local jails. Skyrocketing costs and high rates of recidivism have become issues of major public concern. Attention must be directed towards implementing a long-range corrections strategy that focuses on inmate responsibility through intensive work ethic training.

The legislature finds that many offenders lack basic life skills and have been largely unaffected by traditional correctional philosophies and programs. In addition, many first-time offenders who enter the prison system learn more about how to be criminals than the important qualities, values, and skills needed to successfully adapt to a life without crime.

The legislature finds that opportunities for offenders to improve themselves are extremely limited and there has not been adequate emphasis on alternatives to total confinement for nonviolent offenders.

The legislature finds that the explosion of drug crimes since the inception of the sentencing reform act and the response of the criminal justice system have resulted in a much higher proportion of substance abuse-affected offenders in the state's prisons and jails. The needs of this population differ from those of other offenders and present a great challenge to the system. The problems are exacerbated by the shortage of drug treatment and counseling programs both in and outside of prisons.

The legislature finds that the concept of a work ethic camp that requires the offender to complete an appropriate and balanced combination of highly structured and goal-oriented work programs such as correctional industries based work camps and/or class I and class II work projects, drug rehabilitation, and intensive life management work ethic training, can successfully reduce offender recidivism and lower the overall cost of incarceration.

It is the purpose and intent of RCW 72.09.400 through * 72.09.420, 9.94A.690, and **section 5, chapter 338, Laws of 1993 to implement a regimented work ethic camp that is designed to directly address the high rate of recidivism, reduce upwardly spiraling prison costs, preserve scarce and high cost prison space for the most dangerous offenders, and provide judges with a tough and sound alternative to traditional incarceration without compromising public safety.

\[ [1993 c 338 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1922-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20338%20§%201); \]

## 72.09.410 - Work ethic camp program—Generally.
The department of corrections shall establish one work ethic camp. The secretary shall locate the work ethic camp within an already existing department compound or facility, or in a facility that is scheduled to come on line within the initial implementation date outlined in this section. The facility selected for the camp shall appropriately accommodate the logistical and cost-effective objectives contained in RCW 72.09.400 through * 72.09.420, 9.94A.690, and **section 5, chapter 338, Laws of 1993. The department shall be ready to assign inmates to the camp one hundred twenty days after July 1, 1993. The department shall establish the work ethic camp program cycle to last from one hundred twenty to one hundred eighty days. The department shall develop all aspects of the work ethic camp program including, but not limited to, program standards, conduct standards, educational components including preparation for a high school equivalency certificate as described in RCW 28B.50.536, offender incentives, drug rehabilitation program parameters, individual and team work goals, techniques for improving the offender's self-esteem, citizenship skills for successful living in the community, measures to hold the offender accountable for his or her behavior, and the successful completion of the work ethic camp program granted to the offender based on successful attendance, participation, and performance as defined by the secretary. The work ethic camp shall be designed and implemented so that offenders are continually engaged in meaningful activities and unstructured time is kept to a minimum. In addition, the department is encouraged to explore the integration and overlay of a military style approach to the work ethic camp.

## 72.09.450 - Limitation on denial of access to services and supplies—Recoupment of assessments—Collections.
1. An inmate shall not be denied access to services or supplies required by state or federal law solely on the basis of his or her inability to pay for them.

2. The department shall record all lawfully authorized assessments for services or supplies as a debt to the department. The department shall recoup the assessments when the inmate's institutional account exceeds the indigency standard, and may pursue other remedies to recoup the assessments after the period of incarceration.

3. The department shall record as a debt any costs assessed by a court against an inmate plaintiff where the state is providing defense pursuant to chapter 4.92 RCW. The department shall recoup the debt when the inmate's institutional account exceeds the indigency standard and may pursue other remedies to recoup the debt after the period of incarceration.

4. In order to maximize the cost-efficient collection of unpaid offender debt existing after the period of an offender's incarceration, the department is authorized to use the following nonexclusive options: (a) Use the collection services available through the department of enterprise services, or (b) notwithstanding any provision of chapter 41.06 RCW, contract with collection agencies for collection of the debts. The costs for enterprise services or collection agency services shall be paid by the debtor. Any contract with a collection agency shall only be awarded after competitive bidding. Factors the department shall consider in awarding a collection contract include but are not limited to a collection agency's history and reputation in the community; and the agency's access to a local database that may increase the efficiency of its collections. The servicing of an unpaid obligation to the department does not constitute assignment of a debt, and no contract with a collection agency may remove the department's control over unpaid obligations owed to the department.

## 72.09.460 - Incarcerated individual participation in education and work programs—Postsecondary degree education opportunities—Legislative intent—Priorities—Rules—Payment of costs.
1. Recognizing that there is a positive correlation between education opportunities and reduced recidivism, it is the intent of the legislature to offer appropriate postsecondary degree or certificate opportunities to incarcerated individuals.

2. The legislature intends that all incarcerated individuals be required to participate in department-approved education programs, work programs, or both, unless exempted as specifically provided in this section. Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education or work programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.

3. The legislature recognizes more incarcerated individuals may agree to participate in education and work programs than are available. The department must make every effort to achieve maximum public benefit by placing incarcerated individuals in available and appropriate education and work programs.

4. [Empty]

   a. The department shall, to the extent possible and considering all available funds, prioritize its resources to meet the following goals for incarcerated individuals in the order listed:

      i. Achievement of basic academic skills through obtaining a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate as provided in RCW 28B.50.536, including achievement by those incarcerated individuals eligible for special education services pursuant to state or federal law;

      ii. Achievement of vocational skills necessary for purposes of work programs and for an incarcerated individual to qualify for work upon release;

      iii. Additional work and education programs necessary for compliance with an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270, including special education services and postsecondary degree or certificate education programs; and

      iv. Other appropriate vocational, work, or education programs that are not necessary for compliance with an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270 including postsecondary degree or certificate education programs.

   b. If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department shall pay the cost of such programming, including but not limited to books, materials, and supplies.

   c. If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection, incarcerated individuals shall be required to pay all or a portion of the costs, including books, fees, and tuition, for participation in any vocational, work, or education program as provided in department policies. Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary educational costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities or community-based postsecondary education programs, may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any programming provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection on behalf of an incarcerated individual. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.

   d. The department may accept any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services from any third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities and community-based postsecondary education programs, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of same to complete the purposes of this section.

   e. Any funds collected by the department under (c) and (d) of this subsection and subsections (11) and (12) of this section shall be used solely for the creation, maintenance, or expansion of incarcerated individual educational and vocational programs.

5. The department shall provide access to a program of education to all incarcerated individuals who are under the age of eighteen and who have not met high school graduation requirements or requirements to earn a high school equivalency certificate as provided in RCW 28B.50.536 in accordance with chapter 28A.193 RCW. The program of education established by the department and education provider under RCW 28A.193.020 for incarcerated individuals under the age of eighteen must provide each incarcerated individual a choice of curriculum that will assist the incarcerated individual in achieving a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate. The program of education may include but not be limited to basic education, prevocational training, work ethic skills, conflict resolution counseling, substance abuse intervention, and anger management counseling. The curriculum may balance these and other rehabilitation, work, and training components.

6. [Empty]

   a. In addition to the policies set forth in this section, the department shall consider the following factors in establishing criteria for assessing the inclusion of education and work programs in an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan and in placing incarcerated individuals in education and work programs:

      i. An incarcerated individual's release date and custody level. An incarcerated individual shall not be precluded from participating in an education or work program solely on the basis of his or her release date, except that incarcerated individuals with a release date of more than one hundred twenty months in the future shall not comprise more than ten percent of incarcerated individuals participating in a new class I correctional industry not in existence on June 10, 2004;

      ii. An incarcerated individual's education history and basic academic skills;

      iii. An incarcerated individual's work history and vocational or work skills;

      iv. An incarcerated individual's economic circumstances, including but not limited to an incarcerated individual's family support obligations; and

      v. Where applicable, an incarcerated individual's prior performance in department-approved education or work programs;

   b. The department shall establish, and periodically review, incarcerated individual behavior standards and program outcomes for all education and work programs. Incarcerated individuals shall be notified of applicable behavior standards and program goals prior to placement in an education or work program and shall be removed from the education or work program if they consistently fail to meet the standards or outcomes.

7. Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education or work programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.

8. The department shall establish, by rule, a process for identifying and assessing incarcerated individuals with learning disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and other cognitive impairments to determine whether the person requires accommodations in order to effectively participate in educational programming, including general educational development tests and postsecondary education. The department shall establish a process to provide such accommodations to eligible incarcerated individuals.

9. The department shall establish, and periodically review, goals for expanding access to postsecondary degree and certificate education programs and program completion for all incarcerated individuals, including persons of color. The department may contract and partner with any accredited educational program sponsored by a nonprofit entity, community-based postsecondary education program, or institution with historical evidence of providing education programs to people of color.

10. The department shall establish, by rule, objective medical standards to determine when an incarcerated individual is physically or mentally unable to participate in available education or work programs. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is permanently unable to participate in any available education or work program due to a health condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement under subsection (2) of this section. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is temporarily unable to participate in an education or work program due to a medical condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement of subsection (2) of this section for the period of time he or she is temporarily disabled. The department shall periodically review the medical condition of all incarcerated individuals with temporary disabilities to ensure the earliest possible entry or reentry by incarcerated individuals into available programming.

11. The department shall establish policies requiring an incarcerated individual to pay all or a portion of the costs and tuition for any vocational training or postsecondary education program if the incarcerated individual previously abandoned coursework related to postsecondary degree or certificate education or vocational training without excuse as defined in rule by the department. Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any program on behalf of an incarcerated individual under this subsection. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.

12. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an incarcerated individual sentenced to death under chapter 10.95 RCW or subject to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227:

    a. Shall not be required to participate in education programming except as may be necessary for the maintenance of discipline and security;

    b. May not participate in a postsecondary degree education program offered by the department or its contracted providers, unless the incarcerated individual's participation in the program is paid for by a third party or by the individual;

    c. May participate in prevocational or vocational training that may be necessary to participate in a work program;

    d. Shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to incarcerated individual financial responsibility for programming.

13. If an incarcerated individual has participated in postsecondary education programs, the department shall provide the incarcerated individual with a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts, at no cost to the individual, upon the incarcerated individual's release or transfer to a different facility. Upon the incarcerated individual's completion of a postsecondary education program, the department shall provide to the incarcerated individual, at no cost to the individual, a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts. This requirement applies regardless of whether the incarcerated individual became ineligible to participate in or abandoned a postsecondary education program.

14. For the purposes of this section, "third party" includes a nonprofit entity or community-based postsecondary education program that partners with the department to provide accredited postsecondary education degree and certificate programs at state correctional facilities.
