2. An insurer or its third-party administrator that owns in whole or in part an automobile glass repair facility that is processing a claim limited only to auto glass shall:

   a. Verbally inform the person making the claim of loss, of the right provided under subsection (1) of this section, at the time information regarding the automobile glass repair or replacement facilities is provided; and

   b. Verbally inform the person making the claim of loss that the third-party administrator is an entity separate from the insurer that has a financial arrangement to process automobile glass claims on the insurer's behalf.

3. An insurer or its third-party administrator that owns an interest in an automobile glass repair or replacement facility shall post the following notice in each of its repair facilities:

"THIS AUTOMOBILE GLASS REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT FACILITY IS OWNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY (NAME OF INSURER OR INSURER'S THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR). YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT YOU ARE ENTITLED UNDER WASHINGTON LAW TO SEEK REPAIRS AT ANY AUTOMOBILE GLASS REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT FACILITY OF YOUR CHOICE."

## 48.30.350 - Initiating arbitration of claims under the balance billing protection act with such frequency as to indicate a health carrier's general business practice.
1. It is an unfair or deceptive practice for a health carrier to initiate, with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, arbitration under RCW 48.49.040 with respect to claims submitted by out-of-network providers for services included in RCW 48.49.020 that request payment of a commercially reasonable amount, based on payments for the same or similar services provided in a similar geographic area.

2. As used in this section, "health carrier" has the same meaning as in RCW 48.43.005.

\[ [2019 c 427 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1065-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20427%20§%2016); \]

## 48.30.360 - Performance standards—Premiums—Application—Rules.
1. For purposes of this section, "performance standard" means a contractual provision in a group insurance contract that establishes a specific standard for the insurer's or health carrier's performance of an obligation in the contract, and under which the insurer or health carrier is required to remit a penalty payment, based on a percentage of the premium or a set dollar amount, to the group policyholder for the next policy term if the insurer or health carrier fails to comply with the standard. Group policyholders and insurers or health carriers may calculate the amount of the penalty based on a percentage of the overall premium owed to the insurer or health carrier by the policyholder.

2. Remittance of a performance payment to the group policyholder in compliance with this section does not constitute a premium under RCW 48.18.170 and 48.43.005. Nothing in this section prevents the health care authority from including performance standards in contracts.

3. If a group insurance contract includes any performance standards, the insurer or health carrier must describe the performance standards in the group insurance contract and file the contract with the commissioner.

4. Remittance of a performance payment to the group policyholder in compliance with this section must not be considered a return premium for purposes of RCW 48.14.020 and 48.14.0201.

5. This section does not apply to small groups as defined in RCW 48.43.005.

6. The commissioner may adopt rules to implement this section.

7. For the purposes of this section, "health carrier" has the meaning provided in RCW 48.43.005.

For the purposes of this chapter, the terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband, wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family shall be interpreted as applying equally to state registered domestic partnerships or individuals in state registered domestic partnerships as well as to marital relationships and married persons, and references to dissolution of marriage shall apply equally to state registered domestic partnerships that have been terminated, dissolved, or invalidated, to the extent that such interpretation does not conflict with federal law. Where necessary to implement chapter 521, Laws of 2009, gender-specific terms such as husband and wife used in any statute, rule, or other law shall be construed to be gender neutral, and applicable to individuals in state registered domestic partnerships.
