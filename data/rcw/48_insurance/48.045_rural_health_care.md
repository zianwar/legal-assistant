## 48.45.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that the residents of rural communities are having difficulties in locating and purchasing affordable health insurance. The legislature further finds that many rural communities have sufficient funds to pay for needed services, but those funds are being expended elsewhere causing insufficient funding of local health services. As part of the solution to this problem, rural communities need to be able to structure the financing of local health services to better serve local residents. The legislature further finds that as rural communities need well financed and organized health care, it is in the interest of residents of rural communities that existing unauthorized entities comply with appropriate fiscal solvency standards and consumer safeguards, and that those entities be given an opportunity to come into compliance with existing state laws.

Rural health care service arrangements existing on March 29, 1990, may continue in full operation only so long as they comply with all of the following:

1. Within ten days following March 29, 1990, all rural health care service arrangements shall inform the insurance commissioner of their intent to apply for approval to operate as an entity authorized under chapter 48.44 RCW or intend to merge with an entity authorized under Title 48 RCW or merge with an entity defined in this section;

A rural health care service arrangement which comes into compliance with Title 48 RCW through the method outlined in this chapter shall be subject to all applicable requirements of Title 48 RCW except that the deposit requirements shall not be increased until May 1, 1991.
