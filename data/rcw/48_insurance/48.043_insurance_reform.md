## 48.43.001 - Intent.
It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that all enrollees in managed care settings have access to adequate information regarding health care services covered by health carriers' health plans, and provided by health care providers and health care facilities. It is only through such disclosure that Washington state citizens can be fully informed as to the extent of health insurance coverage, availability of health care service options, and necessary treatment. With such information, citizens are able to make knowledgeable decisions regarding their health care.

## 48.43.005 - Definitions.
Unless otherwise specifically provided, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Adjusted community rate" means the rating method used to establish the premium for health plans adjusted to reflect actuarially demonstrated differences in utilization or cost attributable to geographic region, age, family size, and use of wellness activities.

   d. A carrier discontinues offering all health coverage in the small group market or for groups of up to two hundred, or both markets, in the state and discontinues coverage under all existing group health benefit plans in the applicable market involved if: (i) The carrier provides notice to the commissioner of its intent to discontinue offering all such coverage in the state and its intent to discontinue coverage under all such existing health benefit plans at least one hundred eighty days prior to the date of the discontinuation of coverage under all such existing health benefit plans; and (ii) the carrier provides notice to each covered group of the intent to discontinue the existing health benefit plan at least one hundred eighty days prior to the date of discontinuation. In the case of discontinuation under this subsection, the carrier may not issue any group health coverage in this state in the applicable group market involved for a five-year period beginning on the date of the discontinuation of the last health benefit plan not so renewed. This subsection (4) does not require a carrier to provide notice to the commissioner of its intent to discontinue offering a health benefit plan to new applicants when the carrier does not discontinue coverage of existing enrollees under that health benefit plan; or

   e. A carrier is withdrawing from a service area or from a segment of its service area because the carrier has demonstrated to the insurance commissioner that the carrier's clinical, financial, or administrative capacity to serve enrollees would be exceeded.

5. The provisions of this section do not apply to health plans deemed by the insurance commissioner to be unique or limited or have a short-term purpose, after a written request for such classification by the carrier and subsequent written approval by the insurance commissioner.

## 48.43.065 - Right of individuals to receive services—Right of providers, carriers, and facilities to refuse to participate in or pay for services for reason of conscience or religion—Requirements.
1. The legislature recognizes that every individual possesses a fundamental right to exercise their religious beliefs and conscience. The legislature further recognizes that in developing public policy, conflicting religious and moral beliefs must be respected. Therefore, while recognizing the right of conscientious objection to participating in specific health services, the state shall also recognize the right of individuals enrolled with plans containing the basic health plan services to receive the full range of services covered under the plan.

2. [Empty]

   a. No individual health care provider, religiously sponsored health carrier, or health care facility may be required by law or contract in any circumstances to participate in the provision of or payment for a specific service if they object to so doing for reason of conscience or religion. No person may be discriminated against in employment or professional privileges because of such objection.

   b. The provisions of this section are not intended to result in an enrollee being denied timely access to any service included in the basic health plan services. Each health carrier shall:

      i. Provide written notice to enrollees, upon enrollment with the plan, listing services that the carrier refuses to cover for reason of conscience or religion;

      ii. Provide written information describing how an enrollee may directly access services in an expeditious manner; and

      iii. Ensure that enrollees refused services under this section have prompt access to the information developed pursuant to (b)(ii) of this subsection.

   c. The insurance commissioner shall establish by rule a mechanism or mechanisms to recognize the right to exercise conscience while ensuring enrollees timely access to services and to assure prompt payment to service providers.

3. [Empty]

   a. No individual or organization with a religious or moral tenet opposed to a specific service may be required to purchase coverage for that service or services if they object to doing so for reason of conscience or religion.

   b. The provisions of this section shall not result in an enrollee being denied coverage of, and timely access to, any service or services excluded from their benefits package as a result of their employer's or another individual's exercise of the conscience clause in (a) of this subsection.

   c. The insurance commissioner shall define by rule the process through which health carriers may offer the basic health plan services to individuals and organizations identified in (a) and (b) of this subsection in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2)(c) of this section.

4. Nothing in this section requires a health carrier, health care facility, or health care provider to provide any health care services without appropriate payment of premium or fee.

## 48.43.071 - Health care information—Requirement to provide free copy to covered person appealing denial of social security benefits—Exceptions.
Upon request of a covered person or a covered person's personal representative, an issuer shall provide the covered person or representative with one copy of the covered person's health care information free of charge if the covered person is appealing the denial of federal supplemental security income or social security disability benefits. The issuer may provide the health care information in either paper or electronic format. An issuer is not required to provide a covered person or a covered person's personal representative with a free copy of health care information that has previously been provided free of charge pursuant to a request within the preceding two years. For purposes of this section, "health care information" has the same meaning as in RCW 70.02.010.

   a. All contraceptive drugs, devices, and other products, approved by the federal food and drug administration, including over-the-counter contraceptive drugs, devices, and products, approved by the federal food and drug administration. This includes condoms, regardless of the gender or sexual orientation of the covered person, and regardless of whether they are to be used for contraception or exclusively for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections;

         B.  The drugs and products in subsection (1)(f) of this section; or

      ii. Unless the health plan is offered as a qualifying health plan for a health savings account. For such a qualifying health plan, the carrier must establish the plan's cost sharing for the coverage required by subsection (1) of this section at the minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax exempt contributions and withdrawals from the enrollee's health savings account under internal revenue service laws and regulations; and

   b. May not require a prescription to trigger coverage of over-the-counter contraceptive drugs, devices, and products, approved by the federal food and drug administration, except those reproductive health-related drugs and products as set forth in subsection (1)(f) of this section.

3. A health carrier may not deny the coverage required in subsection (1) of this section because an enrollee changed the enrollee's contraceptive method within a twelve-month period.

4. Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a health benefit plan may not impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section, such as medical management techniques that limit enrollee choice in accessing the full range of contraceptive drugs, devices, or other products, approved by the federal food and drug administration.

5. Benefits provided under this section must be extended to all enrollees, enrolled spouses, and enrolled dependents.

6. This section may not be construed to allow for denial of care on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, marital status, age, citizenship, immigration status, or disability.

8. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. "Gender expression" means a person's gender-related appearance and behavior, whether or not stereotypically associated with the person's gender assigned at birth.

   b. "Gender identity" means a person's internal sense of the person's own gender, regardless of the person's gender assigned at birth.

   c.

9. This section may not be construed to authorize discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression, or perceived gender identity or expression, in the provision of nonreproductive health care services.

10. The commissioner, under RCW 48.30.300, and the human rights commission, under chapter 49.60 RCW[,] shall share enforcement authority over complaints of discrimination under this section as set forth in RCW 49.60.178.

## 48.43.0725 - Reproductive health plan coverage—Immediate postpartum contraception devices.
1. For births taking place in a licensed hospital or birthing center, a health plan must allow a provider to separately bill for devices, implants, professional services, or a combination thereof, associated with immediate postpartum contraception and may not consider such devices, implants, services, or combinations thereof to be part of any payments for general obstetric procedures.

2. For purposes of this section, "immediate postpartum contraception" means the postpartum insertion of intrauterine devices or contraceptive implants performed before the patient is discharged from the hospital or birthing center and includes the devices or implants themselves.

3. This section does not apply to facility services associated with immediate postpartum contraception.

4. Nothing in this section affects an enrollee's right to directly access women's health care services, including contraceptive services.

## 48.43.073 - Required abortion coverage—Limitations.
1. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2019, provides coverage for maternity care or services, the health plan must also provide a covered person with substantially equivalent coverage to permit the abortion of a pregnancy. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if a student health plan, including student health plans deemed by the insurance commissioner to have a short-term limited purpose or duration or to be guaranteed renewable while the covered person is enrolled as a regular full-time undergraduate or graduate student at an accredited higher education institution, issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2022, provides coverage for maternity care or services, the health plan must also provide a covered person with substantially equivalent coverage to permit the abortion of a pregnancy.

2. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a health plan or student health plan subject to subsection (1) of this section may not limit in any way a person's access to services related to the abortion of a pregnancy.

## 48.43.074 - Qualified health plans—Single invoice billing—Certification of compliance required in the segregation plan for premium amounts attributable to coverage of abortion services.
1. The legislature intends to codify the state's current practice of requiring health carriers to bill enrollees with a single invoice and to segregate into a separate account the premium attributable to abortion services for which federal funding is prohibited. Washington has achieved full compliance with section 1303 of the federal patient protection and affordable care act by requiring health carriers to submit a single invoice to enrollees and to segregate into a separate account the premium amounts attributable to coverage of abortion services for which federal funding is prohibited. Further, section 1303 states that the act does not preempt or otherwise have any effect on state laws regarding the prohibition of, or requirement of, coverage, funding, or procedural requirements on abortions.

2. In accordance with RCW 48.43.073 related to requirements for coverage and funding of abortion services, an issuer offering a qualified health plan must:

   a. Bill enrollees and collect payment through a single invoice that includes all benefits and services covered by the qualified health plan; and

   b. Include in the segregation plan required under applicable federal and state law a certification that the issuer's billing and payment processes meet the requirements of this section.

\[ [2019 c 399 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5602-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20399%20§%205); \]

## 48.43.078 - Digital breast tomosynthesis—Intent to ensure women with access—Commissioner's and health care authority's duty to clarify mandates.
1. Digital breast tomosynthesis, also called three-dimensional mammography, is the latest advancement in breast imaging. Studies indicate that digital breast tomosynthesis can result in a forty-one percent increase in invasive cancer detection, a fifteen percent decrease in the recall rate from screening mammography, and a twenty-nine percent increase in the detection of all breast cancers. In addition, the American college of radiology has indicated that tomosynthesis is no longer investigational. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure women have access to the most effective breast imaging and to clarify that the existing mandate for mammography must include tomosynthesis.

2. The legislature directs the office of the insurance commissioner to clarify that the existing mandates for mammography in RCW 48.20.393, 48.21.225, 48.44.325, and 48.46.275 include coverage for tomosynthesis under the same terms and conditions currently allowed for mammography. The application of a deductible and cost sharing is prohibited, consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 300-gg-13.

3. The legislature also directs the health care authority to clarify that the existing mandate for mammography in RCW 41.05.180 includes coverage for tomosynthesis under the same terms and conditions currently allowed for mammography. The application of a deductible and cost sharing is prohibited, consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 300-gg-13.

2. Except for a physician at a referring laboratory that has been billed pursuant to subsection (1)(d) or (6) of this section, no licensed practitioner in the state may, directly or indirectly, charge, bill, or otherwise solicit payment for anatomic pathology services unless such services were rendered personally by the licensed practitioner or under the licensed practitioner's direct supervision in accordance with section 353 of the public health service act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 263a).

3. No patient, insurer, third-party payer, hospital, public health clinic, or nonprofit health clinic may be required to reimburse any licensed practitioner for charges or claims submitted in violation of this section.

4. Nothing in this section may be construed to mandate the assignment of benefits for anatomic pathology services as defined in this section.

      i. Covered chiropractic health care, as defined in RCW 48.43.515, by the health plan under which the enrollee received the services; and

      ii. Provided by the chiropractor, or the chiropractor's employee specified in RCW 18.25.190 (2) or (3) who works in the same location as the chiropractor and to whom the chiropractor, pursuant to rules adopted by the Washington state chiropractic quality assurance commission, has delegated the service.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no health carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Washington may prohibit directly or indirectly its enrollees from freely contracting at any time to obtain any health care services outside the health care plan on any terms or conditions the enrollees choose. Nothing in this section shall be construed to bind a carrier for any services delivered outside the health plan. The provisions of this section shall be disclosed pursuant to *RCW 48.43.095(2). The insurance commissioner is prohibited from adopting rules regarding this section.

5. Every carrier that provides coverage for maternity services must provide notice to policyholders regarding the coverage required under this section. The notice must be in writing and must be transmitted at the earliest of the next mailing to the policyholder, the yearly summary of benefits sent to the policyholder, or January 1 of the year following June 6, 1996.

6. This section does not establish a standard of medical care.

7. This section applies to coverage for maternity services under a contract issued or renewed by a health carrier after June 6, 1996, and applies to plans operating under the health care authority under chapter 41.05 RCW beginning January 1, 1998.

## 48.43.305 - Report of RBC levels—Distribution of report—Formula for determination—Commissioner may make adjustments.
1. Every domestic carrier shall, on or prior to the filing date of March 1st, prepare and submit to the commissioner a report of its RBC levels as of the end of the calendar year just ended, in a form and containing such information as is required by the RBC instructions. In addition, every domestic carrier shall file its RBC report:

   a. With the NAIC in accordance with the RBC instructions; and

   b. With the insurance commissioner in any state in which the carrier is authorized to do business, if the insurance commissioner has notified the carrier of its request in writing, in which case the carrier shall file its RBC report not later than the later of:

Accordingly, carriers should seek to maintain capital above the RBC levels required by RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370. Additional capital is used and useful in the insurance business and helps to secure a carrier against various risks inherent in, or affecting, the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370.

4. If a domestic carrier files an RBC report that in the judgment of the commissioner is inaccurate, then the commissioner shall adjust the RBC report to correct the inaccuracy and shall notify the carrier of the adjustment. The notice shall contain a statement of the reason for the adjustment.

## 48.43.335 - Confidentiality of RBC reports and plans—Use of certain comparisons prohibited—Certain information intended solely for use by commissioner.
1. All RBC reports, to the extent the information therein is not required to be set forth in a publicly available annual statement schedule, and RBC plans, including the results or report of any examination or analysis of a carrier and any corrective order issued by the commissioner, with respect to any domestic carrier or foreign carrier that are filed with the commissioner constitute information that might be damaging to the carrier if made available to its competitors, and therefore shall be kept confidential by the commissioner. This information shall not be made public or be subject to subpoena, other than by the commissioner and then only for the purpose of enforcement actions taken by the commissioner.

2. The comparison of a carrier's total adjusted capital to any of its RBC levels is a regulatory tool that may indicate the need for possible corrective action with respect to the carrier, and is not a means to rank carriers generally. Therefore, except as otherwise required under the provisions of RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370, the making, publishing, disseminating, circulating, or placing before the public, or causing, directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in a newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio or television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement, or statement containing an assertion, representation, or statement with regard to the RBC levels of any carrier, or of any component derived in the calculation, by any carrier, insurance producer, or other person engaged in any manner in the insurance business would be misleading and is therefore prohibited. However, if any materially false statement with respect to the comparison regarding a carrier's total adjusted capital to its RBC levels (or any of them) or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the carrier's RBC levels is published in any written publication and the carrier is able to demonstrate to the commissioner with substantial proof the falsity of such statement, or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the carrier may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.

3. The RBC instructions, RBC reports, adjusted RBC reports, RBC plans, and revised RBC plans are intended solely for use by the commissioner in monitoring the solvency of carriers and the need for possible corrective action with respect to carriers and shall not be used by the commissioner for ratemaking nor considered or introduced as evidence in any rate proceeding nor used by the commissioner to calculate or derive any elements of an appropriate premium level or rate of return for any line of insurance that a carrier or any affiliate is authorized to write.

## 48.43.340 - Powers or duties of commissioner not limited—Rules.
1. The provisions of RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370 are supplemental to any other provisions of the laws and rules of this state, and shall not preclude or limit any other powers or duties of the commissioner under such laws and rules, including, but not limited to, chapter 48.31 RCW.

2. The commissioner may adopt reasonable rules necessary for the implementation of RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370.

## 48.43.345 - Foreign or alien carriers—Required RBC report—Commissioner may require RBC plan—Mandatory control level event.
1. Any foreign or alien carrier shall, upon the written request of the commissioner, submit to the commissioner an RBC report as of the end of the calendar year just ended by the later of:

   a. The date an RBC report would be required to be filed by a domestic carrier under RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370; or

   b. Fifteen days after the request is received by the foreign or alien carrier. Any foreign or alien carrier shall, at the written request of the commissioner, promptly submit to the commissioner a copy of any RBC plan that is filed with the insurance commissioner of any other state.

2. In the event of a company action level event, regulatory action level event, or authorized control level event with respect to any foreign or alien carrier as determined under the RBC statute applicable in the state of domicile of the carrier or, if no RBC statute is in force in that state, under the provisions of RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370, if the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile of the foreign or alien carrier fails to require the foreign or alien carrier to file an RBC plan in the manner specified under that state's RBC statute or, if no RBC statute is in force in that state, under RCW 48.43.310, the commissioner may require the foreign or alien carrier to file an RBC plan with the commissioner. In this event, the failure of the foreign or alien carrier to file an RBC plan with the commissioner is grounds to order the carrier to cease and desist from writing new insurance business in this state.

3. In the event of a mandatory control level event with respect to any foreign or alien carrier, if no domiciliary receiver has been appointed with respect to the foreign or alien carrier under the rehabilitation and liquidation statute applicable in the state of domicile of the foreign or alien carrier, the commissioner may apply for an order under RCW 48.31.080 or 48.31.090 to conserve the assets within this state of foreign or alien carriers, and the occurrence of the mandatory control level event is considered adequate grounds for the application.

   d. The patient is currently experiencing a positive therapeutic outcome on a prescription drug recommended by the patient's provider for the medical condition under consideration while on his or her current or immediately preceding health plan, and changing to the required prescription drug may cause clinically predictable adverse reactions, or physical or mental harm to, the patient; or

   e. The required prescription drug is not in the best interest of the patient, based on documentation of medical appropriateness, because the patient's use of the prescription drug is expected to:

   c. If a response by a health carrier or prescription drug utilization management entity is not received within the time frames established under this section, the exception request is deemed granted.

   d. For purposes of this subsection, exception requests are considered urgent when an enrollee is experiencing a health condition that may seriously jeopardize the enrollee's life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or when an enrollee is undergoing a current course of treatment using a nonformulary drug.

6. Health carriers must cover an emergency supply fill if a treating health care provider determines an emergency fill is necessary to keep the patient stable while the exception request is being processed. This exception shall not be used to solely justify any further exemption.

7. When responding to a prescription drug utilization management exception request, a health carrier or prescription drug utilization management entity shall clearly state in their response if the exception request was approved or denied.

The provider's relationship with the carrier or subcontractor must be continued on the same terms and conditions as those of the contract the plan or subcontractor is terminating, except for any provision requiring that the carrier assign new enrollees to the terminated provider.

8. Every carrier shall meet the standards set forth in this section and any rules adopted by the commissioner to implement this section. In developing rules to implement this section, the commissioner shall consider relevant standards adopted by national managed care accreditation organizations and state agencies that purchase managed health care services.

## 48.43.530 - Requirement for carriers to have comprehensive grievance and appeal processes—Carrier's duties—Procedures—Appeals—Rules.
1. Each carrier and health plan must have fully operational, comprehensive grievance and appeal processes, and for plans that are not grandfathered, fully operational, comprehensive, and effective grievance and review of adverse benefit determination processes that comply with the requirements of this section and any rules adopted by the commissioner to implement this section. For the purposes of this section, the commissioner must consider applicable grievance and appeal or review of adverse benefit determination process standards adopted by national managed care accreditation organizations and state agencies that purchase managed health care services, and for health plans that are not grandfathered health plans as approved by the United States department of health and human services or the United States department of labor. In the case of coverage offered in connection with a group health plan, if either the carrier or the health plan complies with the requirements of this section and RCW 48.43.535, then the obligation to comply is satisfied for both the carrier and the plan with respect to the health insurance coverage.

2. Each carrier and health plan must process as a grievance an enrollee's expression of dissatisfaction about customer service or the quality or availability of a health service. Each carrier must implement procedures for registering and responding to oral and written grievances in a timely and thorough manner.

3. Each carrier and health plan must provide written notice to an enrollee or the enrollee's designated representative, and the enrollee's provider, of its decision to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate payment, coverage, authorization, or provision of health care services or benefits, including the admission to or continued stay in a health care facility. Such notice must be sent directly to a protected individual receiving care when accessing sensitive health care services or when a protected individual has requested confidential communication pursuant to RCW 48.43.505(5).

4. An enrollee's written or oral request that a carrier reconsider its decision to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate payment, coverage, authorization, or provision of health care services or benefits, including the admission to, or continued stay in, a health care facility must be processed as follows:

   a. When the request is made under a grandfathered health plan, the plan and the carrier must process it as an appeal;

   b. When the request is made under a health plan that is not grandfathered, the plan and the carrier must process it as a review of an adverse benefit determination; and

   c. Neither a carrier nor a health plan, whether grandfathered or not, may require that an enrollee file a complaint or grievance prior to seeking appeal of a decision or review of an adverse benefit determination under this subsection.

5. To process an appeal, each plan that is not grandfathered and each carrier offering that plan must:

   a. Provide written notice to the enrollee when the appeal is received;

   b. Assist the enrollee with the appeal process;

   c. Make its decision regarding the appeal within thirty days of the date the appeal is received. An appeal must be expedited if the enrollee's provider or the carrier's medical director reasonably determines that following the appeal process response timelines could seriously jeopardize the enrollee's life, health, or ability to regain maximum function. The decision regarding an expedited appeal must be made within seventy-two hours of the date the appeal is received;

   d. Cooperate with a representative authorized in writing by the enrollee;

   e. Consider information submitted by the enrollee;

   f. Investigate and resolve the appeal; and

   g. Provide written notice of its resolution of the appeal to the enrollee and, with the permission of the enrollee, to the enrollee's providers.

6. Written notice required by subsection (3) of this section must explain:

   a. The carrier's and health plan's decision and the supporting coverage or clinical reasons; and

   b. The carrier's and grandfathered plan's appeal or for plans that are not grandfathered, adverse benefit determination review process, including information, as appropriate, about how to exercise the enrollee's rights to obtain a second opinion, and how to continue receiving services as provided in this section.

7. When an enrollee requests that the carrier or health plan reconsider its decision to modify, reduce, or terminate an otherwise covered health service that an enrollee is receiving through the health plan and the carrier's or health plan's decision is based upon a finding that the health service, or level of health service, is no longer medically necessary or appropriate, the carrier and health plan must continue to provide that health service until the appeal, or for health plans that are not grandfathered, the review of an adverse benefit determination, is resolved. If the resolution of the appeal, review of an adverse benefit determination, or any review sought by the enrollee under RCW 48.43.535 affirms the carrier's or health plan's decision, the enrollee may be responsible for the cost of this continued health service.

8. Each carrier and health plan must provide a clear explanation of the grievance and appeal, or for plans that are not grandfathered, the process for review of an adverse benefit determination process upon request, upon enrollment to new enrollees, and annually to enrollees and subcontractors.

9. Each carrier and health plan must ensure that each grievance, appeal, and for plans that are not grandfathered, grievance and review of adverse benefit determinations, process is accessible to enrollees who are limited English speakers, who have literacy problems, or who have physical or mental disabilities that impede their ability to file a grievance, appeal or review of an adverse benefit determination.

11. In complying with this section, plans that are not grandfathered and the carriers offering them must treat a rescission of coverage, whether or not the rescission has an adverse effect on any particular benefit at that time, and any decision to deny coverage in an initial eligibility determination as an adverse benefit determination.

## 48.43.535 - Independent review of health care disputes—System for using certified independent review organizations—Rules.
1. There is a need for a process for the fair consideration of disputes relating to decisions by carriers that offer a health plan to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate coverage of or payment for health care services for an enrollee. For purposes of this section, "carrier" also applies to a health plan if the health plan administers the appeal process directly or through a third party.

2. An enrollee may seek review by a certified independent review organization of a carrier's decision to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate coverage of or payment for a health care service or of any adverse determination made by a carrier under RCW 48.49.020, 48.49.030, or sections 2799A-1 or 2799A-2 of the public health service act (42 U.S.C. Secs. 300gg-111 or 300gg-112) and implementing federal regulations in effect as of March 31, 2022, after exhausting the carrier's grievance process and receiving a decision that is unfavorable to the enrollee, or after the carrier has exceeded the timelines for grievances provided in RCW 48.43.530, without good cause and without reaching a decision.

3. The commissioner must establish and use a rotational registry system for the assignment of a certified independent review organization to each dispute. The system should be flexible enough to ensure that an independent review organization has the expertise necessary to review the particular medical condition or service at issue in the dispute, and that any approved independent review organization does not have a conflict of interest that will influence its independence.

4. Carriers must provide to the appropriate certified independent review organization, not later than the third business day after the date the carrier receives a request for review, a copy of:

   a. Any medical records of the enrollee that are relevant to the review;

   b. Any documents used by the carrier in making the determination to be reviewed by the certified independent review organization;

   c. Any documentation and written information submitted to the carrier in support of the appeal; and

   d. A list of each physician or health care provider who has provided care to the enrollee and who may have medical records relevant to the appeal. Health information or other confidential or proprietary information in the custody of a carrier may be provided to an independent review organization, subject to rules adopted by the commissioner.

5. Enrollees must be provided with at least five business days to submit to the independent review organization in writing additional information that the independent review organization must consider when conducting the external review. The independent review organization must forward any additional information submitted by an enrollee to the plan or carrier within one business day of receipt by the independent review organization.

6. The medical reviewers from a certified independent review organization will make determinations regarding the medical necessity or appropriateness of, and the application of health plan coverage provisions to, health care services for an enrollee. The medical reviewers' determinations must be based upon their expert medical judgment, after consideration of relevant medical, scientific, and cost-effectiveness evidence, and medical standards of practice in the state of Washington. Except as provided in this subsection, the certified independent review organization must ensure that determinations are consistent with the scope of covered benefits as outlined in the medical coverage agreement. Medical reviewers may override the health plan's medical necessity or appropriateness standards if the standards are determined upon review to be unreasonable or inconsistent with sound, evidence-based medical practice.

7. Once a request for an independent review determination has been made, the independent review organization must proceed to a final determination, unless requested otherwise by both the carrier and the enrollee or the enrollee's representative.

   a. An enrollee or carrier may request an expedited external review if the adverse benefit determination or internal adverse benefit determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the claimant received emergency services but has not been discharged from a facility; or involves a medical condition for which the standard external review time frame would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or jeopardize the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function. The independent review organization must make its decision to uphold or reverse the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination and notify the enrollee and the carrier or health plan of the determination as expeditiously as possible but within not more than seventy-two hours after the receipt of the request for expedited external review. If the notice is not in writing, the independent review organization must provide written confirmation of the decision within forty-eight hours after the date of the notice of the decision.

   b. For claims involving experimental or investigational treatments, the independent review organization must ensure that adequate clinical and scientific experience and protocols are taken into account as part of the external review process.

8. Carriers must timely implement the certified independent review organization's determination, and must pay the certified independent review organization's charges.

9. When an enrollee requests independent review of a dispute under this section, and the dispute involves a carrier's decision to modify, reduce, or terminate an otherwise covered health service that an enrollee is receiving at the time the request for review is submitted and the carrier's decision is based upon a finding that the health service, or level of health service, is no longer medically necessary or appropriate, the carrier must continue to provide the health service if requested by the enrollee until a determination is made under this section. If the determination affirms the carrier's decision, the enrollee may be responsible for the cost of the continued health service.

10. Each certified independent review organization must maintain written records and make them available upon request to the commissioner.

11. A certified independent review organization may notify the office of the insurance commissioner if, based upon its review of disputes under this section, it finds a pattern of substandard or egregious conduct by a carrier.

12. [Empty]

    a. The commissioner shall adopt rules to implement this section after considering relevant standards adopted by national managed care accreditation organizations and the national association of insurance commissioners.

    b. This section is not intended to supplant any existing authority of the office of the insurance commissioner under this title to oversee and enforce carrier compliance with applicable statutes and rules.

   c. That any physician, health care provider, or contract specialist making a review determination in a specific review is free of any actual or potential conflict of interest or bias. Neither the expert reviewer, nor the independent review organization, nor any officer, director, or management employee of the independent review organization may have any material professional, familial, or financial affiliation with any of the following: The health carrier; professional associations of carriers and providers; the provider; the provider's medical or practice group; the health facility at which the service would be provided; the developer or manufacturer of a drug or device under review; or the enrollee;

In exceptional circumstances, when the independent review organization has not obtained information necessary to make a determination, a determination may be made by the twenty-fifth day after the date the organization received the request for the determination; and

      ii. In requests for expedited review under RCW 48.43.535(7)(a), as expeditiously as possible but within not more than seventy-two hours after the date the independent review organization receives the request for expedited review;

That the independent review organization meets any other reasonable requirements of the insurance commissioner directly related to the functions the organization is to perform under this section and RCW 48.43.535, and related to assessing fees to carriers in a manner consistent with the maximum fee schedule developed under this section.

3. To be certified as an independent review organization under this chapter, an organization must submit to the insurance commissioner an application in the form required by the insurance commissioner. The application must include:

   a. A health carrier shall adhere to the accepted standard of care for health care providers under chapter 7.70 RCW when arranging for the provision of medically necessary health care services to its enrollees.

      ii. Agents; or

      iii. Ostensible agents who are acting on its behalf and over whom it has the right to exercise influence or control or has actually exercised influence or control.

3. This section does not create any new cause of action, or eliminate any presently existing cause of action, with respect to health care providers and health care facilities that are included in and subject to the provisions of chapter 7.70 RCW.

4. It is a defense to any action or liability asserted under this section against a health carrier that:

   a. The health care service in question is not a benefit provided under the plan or the service is subject to limitations under the plan that have been exhausted;

   b. Neither the health carrier, nor any employee, agent, or ostensible agent for whose conduct the health carrier is liable under subsection (1)(b) of this section, controlled, influenced, or participated in the health care decision; or

6. Nothing in any law of this state prohibiting a health carrier from practicing medicine or being licensed to practice medicine may be asserted as a defense by the health carrier in an action brought against it under this section.

7. [Empty]

   a. A person may not maintain a cause of action under this section against a health carrier unless:

## 48.43.600 - Overpayment recovery—Carrier.
1. Except in the case of fraud, or as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a carrier may not: (a) Request a refund from a health care provider of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim unless it does so in writing to the provider within twenty-four months after the date that the payment was made; or (b) request that a contested refund be paid any sooner than six months after receipt of the request. Any such request must specify why the carrier believes the provider owes the refund. If a provider fails to contest the request in writing to the carrier within thirty days of its receipt, the request is deemed accepted and the refund must be paid.

2. A carrier may not, if doing so for reasons related to coordination of benefits with another carrier or entity responsible for payment of a claim: (a) Request a refund from a health care provider of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim unless it does so in writing to the provider within thirty months after the date that the payment was made; or (b) request that a contested refund be paid any sooner than six months after receipt of the request. Any such request must specify why the carrier believes the provider owes the refund, and include the name and mailing address of the entity that has primary responsibility for payment of the claim. If a provider fails to contest the request in writing to the carrier within thirty days of its receipt, the request is deemed accepted and the refund must be paid.

3. A carrier may at any time request a refund from a health care provider of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim if: (a) A third party, including a government entity, is found responsible for satisfaction of the claim as a consequence of liability imposed by law, such as tort liability; and (b) the carrier is unable to recover directly from the third party because the third party has either already paid or will pay the provider for the health services covered by the claim.

4. If a contract between a carrier and a health care provider conflicts with this section, this section shall prevail. However, nothing in this section prohibits a health care provider from choosing at any time to refund to a carrier any payment previously made to satisfy a claim.

5. For purposes of this section, "refund" means the return, either directly or through an offset to a future claim, of some or all of a payment already received by a health care provider.

6. This section neither permits nor precludes a carrier from recovering from a subscriber, enrollee, or beneficiary any amounts paid to a health care provider for benefits to which the subscriber, enrollee, or beneficiary was not entitled under the terms and conditions of the health plan, insurance policy, or other benefit agreement.

7. This section does not apply to claims for health care services provided through dental only health carriers, health care services provided under Title XVIII (medicare) of the social security act, or medicare supplemental plans regulated under chapter 48.66 RCW.

## 48.43.605 - Overpayment recovery—Health care provider.
1. Except in the case of fraud, or as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a health care provider may not: (a) Request additional payment from a carrier to satisfy a claim unless he or she does so in writing to the carrier within twenty-four months after the date that the claim was denied or payment intended to satisfy the claim was made; or (b) request that the additional payment be made any sooner than six months after receipt of the request. Any such request must specify why the provider believes the carrier owes the additional payment.

2. A health care provider may not, if doing so for reasons related to coordination of benefits with another carrier or entity responsible for payment of a claim: (a) Request additional payment from a carrier to satisfy a claim unless he or she does so in writing to the carrier within thirty months after the date the claim was denied or payment intended to satisfy the claim was made; or (b) request that the additional payment be made any sooner than six months after receipt of the request. Any such request must specify why the provider believes the carrier owes the additional payment, and include the name and mailing address of any entity that has disclaimed responsibility for payment of the claim.

3. If a contract between a carrier and a health care provider conflicts with this section, this section shall prevail. However, nothing in this section prohibits a carrier from choosing at any time to make additional payments to a provider to satisfy a claim.

4. This section does not apply to claims for health care services provided through dental only health carriers, health care services provided under Title XVIII (medicare) of the social security act, or medicare supplemental plans regulated under chapter 48.66 RCW.

## 48.43.710 - Certification as qualified health plan not an exemption.

## 48.43.715 - Individual and small group market—Selection of benchmark plan—Minimum requirements—Criteria—List of state-mandated health benefits.
1. The commissioner, in consultation with the board and the health care authority, shall, by rule, select the largest small group plan in the state by enrollment as the benchmark plan for the individual and small group market for purposes of establishing the essential health benefits in Washington state.

2. If the essential health benefits benchmark plan for the individual and small group market does not include all of the ten essential health benefits categories, the commissioner, in consultation with the board and the health care authority, shall, by rule, supplement the benchmark plan benefits as needed.

3. All individual and small group health plans must cover the ten essential health benefits categories, other than a health plan offered through the federal basic health program, a grandfathered health plan, or medicaid. Such a health plan may not be offered in the state unless the commissioner finds that it is substantially equal to the benchmark plan. When making this determination, the commissioner:

   a. Must ensure that the plan covers the ten essential health benefits categories;

   b. May consider whether the health plan has a benefit design that would create a risk of biased selection based on health status and whether the health plan contains meaningful scope and level of benefits in each of the ten essential health benefits categories;

   c. Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this subsection, for benefit years beginning January 1, 2015, must establish by rule the review and approval requirements and procedures for pediatric oral services when offered in stand-alone dental plans in the nongrandfathered individual and small group markets outside of the exchange; and

   d. Must allow health carriers to also offer pediatric oral services within the health benefit plan in the nongrandfathered individual and small group markets outside of the exchange.

4. Beginning December 15, 2012, and every year thereafter, the commissioner shall submit to the legislature a list of state-mandated health benefits, the enforcement of which will result in federally imposed costs to the state related to the plans sold through the exchange because the benefits are not included in the essential health benefits designated under federal law. The list must include the anticipated costs to the state of each state-mandated health benefit on the list and any statutory changes needed if funds are not appropriated to defray the state costs for the listed mandate. The commissioner may enforce a mandate on the list for the entire market only if funds are appropriated in an omnibus appropriations act specifically to pay the state portion of the identified costs.

5. Upon authorization by the legislature to modify the state's essential health benefits benchmark plan under 45 C.F.R. Sec. 156.111, the commissioner shall include coverage for donor human milk in the updated plan.

   b. The commissioner must include in deliberations related to reinsurance rule making an analysis of an invisible high risk pool option, in which the full premium and risk associated with certain high-risk or high-cost enrollees would be ceded to the transitional reinsurance program. The analysis must include a determination as to whether that option is authorized under the federal reinsurance program regulations, whether the option would provide sufficiently comprehensive coverage for current nonmedicare high risk pool enrollees, and how an invisible high risk pool option could be designed to ensure that carriers ceding risk provide effective care management to high-risk or high-cost enrollees.

2. Consistent with federal law, the rules for the reinsurance program must, at a minimum, establish:

   a. A mechanism to collect reinsurance contribution funds;

   b. A reinsurance payment formula; and

   c. A mechanism to disburse reinsurance payments.

3. [Empty]

   a. The commissioner may adjust the rules adopted under this section as needed to preserve a healthy market both inside and outside of the exchange.

The commissioner must identify by rule the sources of the data, and other requirements related to the collection, validation, correction, interpretation, transmission or exchange, and retention of the data.

4. The commissioner shall contract with one or more nonprofit entities to administer the risk adjustment and reinsurance programs.

5. Contribution amounts for the transitional reinsurance program under section 1341 of P.L. 111-148 of 2010, as amended, may be increased to include amounts sufficient to cover the costs of administration of the reinsurance program including reasonable costs incurred for preoperational and planning activities related to the reinsurance program.

2. For the purpose of mitigating inequity in the health insurance market, unless waived by the commissioner pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the commissioner must assess a fee on any health carrier offering a health plan or student health plan if the health plan or student health plan excludes, under state or federal law, any essential health benefit or coverage that is otherwise required or mandated by this title or rules adopted by the commissioner.

   a. The commissioner shall set the fee in an amount that is the actuarial equivalent of costs attributed to the provision and administration of the excluded benefit. As part of its rate filing, a health carrier subject to this subsection (2) must submit to the commissioner an estimate of the amount of the fee, including supporting documentation of its methods for estimating the fee. The carrier must include in its supporting documentation a certification by a member of the American academy of actuaries that the estimated fee is the actuarial equivalent of costs attributed to the provision and administration of the excluded benefit.

   b. Fees paid under this section must be deposited into the general fund.

   c. The commissioner may waive the fee assessed under this subsection (2) if he or she finds that the carrier excluding a mandated benefit for a health plan or student health plan provides health plan enrollees or student health plan enrollees alternative access to all excluded mandated benefits.

3. Beginning July 1, 2021, the commissioner shall provide on its website written notice of the carrier requirements in this section and information on alternate ways in which enrollees may access excluded benefits in a timely manner.

4. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the commissioner to take enforcement action if a health carrier unlawfully fails to comply with the provisions of this title.

5. The commissioner shall adopt any rules necessary to implement this section.

4. Stand-alone dental and stand-alone vision plans offered by a disability insurer to out-of-state groups specified by RCW 48.21.010(2) may be negotiated, but may not be offered in this state before the commissioner finds that the stand-alone dental or stand-alone vision plan otherwise meets the standards set forth in RCW 48.21.010(2) (a) and (b).

The office of the insurance commissioner must provide written notice of the change in internal revenue service guidance to affected parties, the chief clerk of the house of representatives, the secretary of the senate, the office of the code reviser, and others as deemed appropriate by the office.
