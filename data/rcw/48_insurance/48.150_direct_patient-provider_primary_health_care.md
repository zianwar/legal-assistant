## 48.150.005 - Public policy.
It is the public policy of Washington to promote access to medical care for all citizens and to encourage innovative arrangements between patients and providers that will help provide all citizens with a medical home.

Washington needs a multipronged approach to provide adequate health care to many citizens who lack adequate access to it. Direct patient-provider practices, in which patients enter into a direct relationship with medical practitioners and pay a fixed amount directly to the health care provider for primary care services, represent an innovative, affordable option which could improve access to medical care, reduce the number of people who now lack such access, and cut down on emergency room use for primary care purposes, thereby freeing up emergency room facilities to treat true emergencies.

   d. Pay for health care services covered by a direct agreement rendered to direct patients by providers other than the providers in the direct practice or their employees, except as described in subsection (2)(b) of this section.

2. Direct practices and providers may:

   a. Enter into a participating provider contract as defined by RCW 48.44.010 and 48.46.020 or plans administered under chapter 41.05, 70.47, or * 70.47A RCW for purposes other than payment of claims for services provided to direct patients through a direct agreement.

1. Direct practices may not decline to accept new direct patients or discontinue care to existing patients solely because of the patient's health status. A direct practice may decline to accept a patient if the practice has reached its maximum capacity, or if the patient's medical condition is such that the provider is unable to provide the appropriate level and type of health care services in the direct practice. So long as the direct practice provides the patient notice and opportunity to obtain care from another physician, the direct practice may discontinue care for direct patients if: (a) The patient fails to pay the direct fee under the terms required by the direct agreement; (b) the patient has performed an act that constitutes fraud; (c) the patient repeatedly fails to comply with the recommended treatment plan; (d) the patient is abusive and presents an emotional or physical danger to the staff or other patients of the direct practice; or (e) the direct practice discontinues operation as a direct practice.

2. Subject to the restrictions established in this chapter, direct practices may accept payment of direct fees directly or indirectly from third parties. A direct practice may accept a direct fee paid by an employer on behalf of an employee who is a direct patient. However, a direct practice shall not enter into a contract with an employer relating to direct practice agreements between the direct practice and employees of that employer, other than to establish the timing and method of the payment of the direct fee by the employer.

## 48.150.110 - Direct agreement requirements—Disclaimer.
