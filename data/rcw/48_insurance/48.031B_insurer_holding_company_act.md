## 48.31B.010 - Domestic insurer may acquire subsidiaries—Authorized investments—Insurer ceases to control subsidiary—Disposal of investment.
1. A domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may organize or acquire one or more subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and their authority to do so is not limited by reason of the fact that they are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.

2. In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities permitted under this title, a domestic insurer may also:

   a. Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of ten percent of the insurer's assets or fifty percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that, after such investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs. In calculating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries, health maintenance organizations, and health care service contractors are excluded, and there is included:

      i. Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities;

      ii. All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities; and

      iii. All contributions to the capital and surplus of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation;

   b. Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer provided that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that such investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in (a) of this subsection or chapter 48.13 RCW applicable to the insurer. For the purpose of this subsection, the total investment of the insurer includes:

      i. Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset;

      ii. The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which is calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of the subsidiary; and

      iii. With the approval of the commissioner, any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries, provided that after the investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.

3. Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities made according to subsection (2) of this section are not subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this title applicable to such investments of insurers.

4. Whether any investment made according to subsection (2) of this section meets the applicable requirements of that subsection is to be determined before the investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, net including dividends.

5. If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment in that subsidiary within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment was made, the investment met the requirements for investment under any other section of this title, and the insurer has notified the commissioner thereof.

4. [Empty]

   a. The commissioner shall approve a merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (1) of this section unless, after a public hearing thereon, he or she finds that:

      i. After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsection (1) of this section would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;

      ii. The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein. In applying the competitive standard in this subsection (4)(a)(ii):

          A.  The informational requirements of RCW 48.31B.020(3)(a) and the standards of RCW 48.31B.020(4)(b) apply;

          B.  The merger or other acquisition may not be disapproved if the commissioner finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by RCW 48.31B.020(4)(c) exist; and

          C.  The commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time;

      iii. The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;

      iv. The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;

      v. The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or

      vi. The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance-buying public.

   b. The public hearing referred to in (a) of this subsection must be held within thirty days after the statement required by subsection (1) of this section is filed, and at least twenty days' notice must be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement. Not less than seven days' notice of the public hearing must be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to such other persons as may be designated by the commissioner. The commissioner must make a determination within the sixty-day period preceding the effective date of the proposed transaction. At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of the hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected has the right to present evidence, examine, and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection therewith are entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the superior court of this state. All discovery proceedings must be concluded not later than three days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.

   c. If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in (b) of this subsection may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in subsection (1) of this section. Such person shall file the statement referred to in subsection (1) of this section with the national association of insurance commissioners within five days of making the request for a public hearing. A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt out within ten days of the receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (1) of this section. A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled. Such commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend such hearing, in person, or by telecommunication.

   d. In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the commissioner that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and rules of this state shall be made not later than sixty days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section.

   e. The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control.

5. This section does not apply to:

   a. Any transaction that is subject to RCW 48.31.010, dealing with the merger or consolidation of two or more insurers;

   b. An offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the commissioner by order exempts as not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer, or as otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.

6. The following are violations of this section:

   a. The failure to file a statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed under subsection (1) or (2) of this section; or

   b. The effectuation or an attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given approval thereto.

7. The courts of this state are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and over all actions involving that person arising out of violations of this section, and each such person is deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by that person of the commissioner to be the person's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in an action, suit, or proceeding arising out of violations of this section. Copies of all lawful process must be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to such person at the person's last known address.

              I. Combined market share of the involved insurers exceed twelve percent of the total market; and

              II. Market share increase by more than two percent of the total market.

For the purpose of this subsection (2)(b)(iv), a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state;

      v. An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required under this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business;

      vi. An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds that the insurer is in failing condition, there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition, and the public benefits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.

3. An acquisition covered by subsection (2) of this section may be subject to an order under subsection (5) of this section unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification. The commissioner must give confidential treatment to information submitted under this subsection (3) in the same manner as provided in RCW 48.31B.038.

   a. The preacquisition notification must be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners relating to those markets that, under subsection (2)(b)(iv) of this section, cause the acquisition not to be exempted from this section. The commissioner may require such additional material and information as he or she deems necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of subsection (4) of this section. The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of the person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion.

   b. The waiting period required begins on the date of the receipt by the commissioner of a preacquisition notification and ends on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of the receipt or the termination of the waiting period by the commissioner. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the commissioner on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period ends on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the commissioner or the termination of the waiting period by the commissioner.

4. [Empty]

   a. The commissioner may enter an order under subsection (5)(a) of this section with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in a line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (3) of this section.

   b. In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of (a) of this subsection, the commissioner shall consider the following:

      i. An acquisition covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards:

         A.  If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:

Insurer AInsurer B4% 4% or more10% 2% or more15% 1% or more; or

Insurer A

Insurer B

4%

 

4% or more

10%

 

2% or more

1% or more; or

         B.  If the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:

Insurer AInsurer B5% 5% or more10% 4% or more15% 3% or more19% 1% or more

Insurer A

Insurer B

5%

 

5% or more

10%

 

4% or more

15%

 

3% or more

19%

 

1% or more

A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in (a) of this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection (4)(b)(i), the insurer with the largest share of the market is Insurer A.

      ii. There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of a grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period of time extending from a base year five to ten years before the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. An acquisition or merger covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in (a) of this subsection if:

          A.  There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;

          B.  One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of such large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and

          C.  Another involved insurer's market is two percent or more.

      iii. For the purposes of this subsection (4)(b):

           A.  "Insurer" includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership, or control;

           B.  "Market" means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state;

           C.  The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the commissioner.

      iv. Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, the commissioner may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this subsection include, but are not limited to, the following: Market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.

   c. An order may not be entered under subsection (5)(a) of this section if:

      i. The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource use that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits that would arise from the economies exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; or

      ii. The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition.

5. [Empty]

   a. [Empty]

      i. If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the commissioner may enter an order:

         A.  Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or

         B.  Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state.

      ii. Such an order may not be entered unless:

          A.  There is a hearing;

          B.  Notice of the hearing is issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than fifteen days prior to the hearing; and

          C.  The hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than sixty days after the filing of the preacquisition notification with the commissioner.

      iii. Every order must be accompanied by a written decision of the commissioner setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.

      iv. An order pursuant to this subsection (5)(a) does not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.

   b. Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner under (a) of this subsection and while the order is in effect, may, after notice and hearing and upon order of the commissioner, be subject at the discretion of the commissioner to one or more of the following:

      i. A monetary fine of not more than ten thousand dollars for every day of violation; or

      ii. Suspension or revocation of the person's license; or

      iii. Both (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection.

   c. Any insurer or other person who fails to make a filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with the filing requirement, is subject to a civil penalty of not more than fifty thousand dollars.

6. RCW 48.31B.045 (2) and (3) and 48.31B.055 do not apply to acquisitions covered under subsection (2) of this section.

1. Every insurer that is authorized to do business in this state and is a member of an insurance holding company system shall register with the commissioner, except a foreign insurer subject to registration requirements and standards adopted by statute or regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile that are substantially similar to those contained in:

   a. This section;

Any insurer which is subject to registration under this section shall register within fifteen days after it becomes subject to registration, and annually thereafter by May 1st of each year for the previous calendar year, unless the commissioner for good cause shown extends the time for registration, and then within the extended time. The commissioner may require any insurer authorized to do business in the state that is a member of a holding company system, and which is not subject to registration under this section, to furnish a copy of the registration statement, the summary specified in subsection (3) of this section, or other information filed by the insurance company with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary jurisdiction.

      vi. Reinsurance agreements;

      vii. Dividends and other distributions to shareholders; and

      viii. Consolidated tax allocation agreements;

   d. Any pledge of the insurer's stock, including stock of subsidiary or controlling affiliate, for a loan made to a member of the insurance holding company system;

   e. If requested by the commissioner, the insurer must include financial statements of or within an insurance holding company system, including all affiliates. Financial statements may include but are not limited to annual audited financial statements filed with the United States securities and exchange commission pursuant to the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. An insurer required to file financial statements pursuant to this subsection (2)(e) may satisfy the request by providing the commissioner with the most recently filed parent corporation financial statements that have been filed with the United States securities and exchange commission;

   f. Other matters concerning transactions between registered insurers and any affiliates as may be included from time to time in registration forms adopted or approved by the commissioner;

   g. Statements that the insurer's board of directors oversees corporate governance and internal controls and that the insurer's officers or senior management have approved, implemented, and continue to maintain and monitor corporate governance and internal control procedures; and

3. All registration statements must contain a summary outlining all items in the current registration statement representing changes from the prior registration statement.

4. No information need be disclosed on the registration statement filed under subsection (2) of this section if the information is not material for the purposes of this section. Unless the commissioner by rule or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments, or guarantees involving one-half of one percent or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of December 31st next preceding are not deemed material for purposes of this section.

5. Subject to RCW 48.31B.030(2), each registered insurer shall report to the commissioner all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within fifteen business days after their declaration.

6. Any person within an insurance holding company system subject to registration is required to provide complete and accurate information to an insurer, where the information is reasonably necessary to enable the insurer to comply with this chapter.

7. The commissioner shall terminate the registration of an insurer that demonstrates that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.

8. The commissioner may require or allow two or more affiliated insurers subject to registration under this section to file a consolidated registration statement.

9. The commissioner may allow an insurer authorized to do business in this state and which is part of an insurance holding company system to register on behalf of an affiliated insurer which is required to register under subsection (1) of this section and to file all information and material required to be filed under this section.

11. Any person may file with the commissioner a disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer, or any insurer or any member of an insurance holding company system may file the disclaimer. The disclaimer must fully disclose all material relationships and bases for affiliation between the person and the insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming the affiliation. A disclaimer of affiliation is deemed to have been granted unless the commissioner, within thirty days following receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is disallowed. In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted. The disclaiming party is relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the commissioner, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.

12. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report. The report must, to the best of the ultimate controlling person's knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. The report must be filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners.

13. The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by this section within the time specified for filing is a violation of this section.

      vi. The insurer's surplus regarding policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholders or affiliates must be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.

   b. The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and a person in its insurance holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section, which are subject to the materiality standards contained in this subsection (1)(b), may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into the transaction at least thirty days before, or such shorter period as the commissioner may permit, and the commissioner has not disapproved it within that period. The notice for amendments or modifications must include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice must be reported, within thirty days after a termination of a previously filed agreement, to the commissioner for determination of the type of filing required, if any:

      i. Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees, or investments if the transactions are equal to or exceed:

         A.  With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent of surplus as regards policyholders;

         B.  With respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets; each as of December 31st next preceding;

      ii. Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes the loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, an affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit if the transactions are equal to or exceed:

          A.  With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent of surplus as regards policyholders;

          B.  With respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets; each as of December 31st next preceding;

      iii. Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:

           A.  All reinsurance pooling agreements;

           B.  Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three years, equals or exceeds five percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of December 31st next preceding, including those agreements that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;

      iv. All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees, and all cost-sharing arrangements;

      v. Guarantees when made by a domestic insurer. However, a guarantee which is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirements of this subsection (1)(b)(v) unless it exceeds the lesser of one-half of one percent of the insurer's admitted assets or ten percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31st next preceding. Further, all guarantees which are not quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this subsection (1)(b)(v);

      vi. Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that controls the insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount which, together with its present holdings in such investments, exceeds two and one-half percent of the insurer's surplus to policyholders.

      vii. Any material transactions, specified by rule, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.

This subsection does not authorize or permit any transaction which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.

   c. A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner determines that the separate transactions were entered into over any twelve-month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise his or her authority under RCW 48.31B.045.

   d. The commissioner, in reviewing transactions under (b) of this subsection, must consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in (a) of this subsection and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.

   e. The commissioner must be notified within thirty days of an investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent of the corporation's voting securities.

2. [Empty]

   a. A domestic insurer shall not pay an extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until thirty days after the commissioner declares that he or she has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment, or until the commissioner has approved the payment within the thirty-day period.

   b. For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution is any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of:

      i. Ten percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders or net worth as of December next preceding; or

      ii. The net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurance company, or the net income if the company is not a life insurance company, not including realized capital gains for the twelve-month period ending December next preceding, but does not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.

   c. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry forward provision must be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.

   d. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the commissioner's approval. The declaration confers no rights upon shareholders until: (i) The commissioner has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution; or (ii) the commissioner has not disapproved the payment within the thirty-day period referred to in (a) of this subsection.

3. For purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, must be considered:

   a. The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;

   b. The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among several lines of insurance;

   c. The number and size of risks insured in each line of business;

   d. The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks;

   e. The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;

   f. The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;

   g. The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;

   h. The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;

   i. The adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and

   j. The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The commissioner may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner the investment so warrants.

4. [Empty]

   a. Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer are not thereby relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer must be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this title.

   b. This section does not preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with one or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (1)(a) of this section.

   c. At least one-third of a domestic insurer's directors and at least one-third of the members of each committee of the insurer's board of directors must be persons who are not: (i) Officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the insurer; or (ii) beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting securities of the insurer or of any such entity. A quorum for transacting business at a meeting of the insurer's board of directors or any committee of the board of directors must include at least one such person.

   d. The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish one or more committees comprised solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity. The committee or committees have responsibility for nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer, and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers.

   e. The provisions of (c) and (d) of this subsection do not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer, such as an insurer, a mutual holding company, or publicly held corporation, has a board of directors and committees thereof that meet the requirements of (c) and (d) of this subsection with respect to such controlling entity.

   f. An insurer may make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection, if the insurer's annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, is less than three hundred million dollars. An insurer may also make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection based upon unique circumstances. The commissioner may consider various factors including, but not limited to, the type of business entity, volume of business written, availability of qualified board members, or the ownership or organizational structure of the entity.

## 48.31B.035 - Examination of insurers—Commissioner may order production of information—Failure to comply—Costs of examination.
1. Subject to the limitation contained in this section and in addition to the powers that the commissioner has under chapter 48.03 RCW relating to the examination of insurers, the commissioner has the power to examine any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 and its affiliates to ascertain the financial condition of the insurer, including the enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party, or by any entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company system, or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated basis.

2. [Empty]

   a. The commissioner may order any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 to produce such records, books, papers, or other information in the possession of the insurer or its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this title.

   b. To determine compliance with this title, the commissioner may order any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 to produce information not in the possession of the insurer if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to contractual relationships, statutory obligations, or other method. In the event the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the commissioner, the insurer shall provide the commissioner a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information. Whenever it appears to the commissioner that the detailed explanation is without merit, the commissioner may require, after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a fine of ten thousand dollars for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the insurer's license. The commissioner shall transfer the fine collected under this section to the state treasurer for deposit into the general fund.

3. The commissioner may retain at the registered insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as are reasonably necessary to assist in the conduct of the examination under subsection (1) of this section. Any persons so retained are under the direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions under RCW 48.03.060, each registered insurer producing for examination records, books, and papers under subsection (1) of this section is liable for and must pay the expense of the examination.

5. In the event the insurer fails to comply with an order, the commissioner has the power to examine the affiliates to obtain the information. The commissioner also has the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths, and to examine under oath any person for purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order is punishable as contempt of court. Every person is required to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the state.

## 48.31B.036 - Internationally active insurance groups—Group-wide supervision—Commissioner's authority and duties—Costs.
1. The commissioner is authorized to act as the group-wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group under this section. However, the commissioner may otherwise acknowledge another regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor where the internationally active insurance group:

   a. Does not have substantial insurance operations in the United States;

   b. Has substantial insurance operations in the United States, but not in this state; or

   c. Has substantial insurance operations in the United States and this state, but the commissioner has determined under the factors set forth in subsections (2) and (6) of this section that the other regulatory official is the appropriate group-wide supervisor.

An insurance holding company system that does not otherwise qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the commissioner make a determination or acknowledgment as to a group-wide supervisor under this section.

2. In cooperation with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, the commissioner must identify a single group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The commissioner may determine that the commissioner is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state. However, the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The commissioner shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment under this subsection:

   a. The place of domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group that hold the largest share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities;

   b. The place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer(s) in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;

   c. The location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;

   d. Whether another regulatory official is acting or is seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor under a regulatory system that the commissioner determines to be:

      i. Substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of this state; or

      ii. Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for group-wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and

   e. Whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.

However, a commissioner identified under this section as the group-wide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group-wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group-wide supervisor must be made after consideration of the factors listed in (a) through (e) of this subsection, and must be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group, and in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.

3. When another regulatory official is acting as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor. However, in the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in:

   a. The internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in this state holding the largest share of the group's premiums, assets, or liabilities; or

   b. This state being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer(s) in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group,

the commissioner shall make a determination or acknowledgment as to the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group under subsection (2) of this section.

4. Under RCW 48.31B.035 the commissioner is authorized to collect from any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 all information necessary to determine whether the commissioner may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the commissioner may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group-wide supervisor. Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group has no less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with additional information pertinent to the pending determination. The commissioner shall publish in the Washington State Register and on the commissioner's website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to group-wide supervision by the commissioner.

5. If the commissioner is the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in any of the following group-wide supervision activities:

   a. Assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:

      i. The material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and

      ii. Reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;

   b. Request from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the commissioner's supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk, including, but not limited to, information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding:

      i. Governance, risk assessment, and management;

      ii. Capital adequacy; and

      iii. Material intercompany transactions;

   c. Coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdiction where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;

   d. Communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information subject to the confidentiality provisions of RCW 48.31B.038, through supervisory colleges as set forth in RCW 48.31B.037 or otherwise;

   e. Enter into agreements with or obtain documents from any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025, any member of the internationally active insurance group, and any other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for or otherwise clarifying the commissioner's role as group-wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. The agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this state; and

   f. Other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes of this subsection (5), as considered necessary by the commissioner.

6. If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the national association of insurance commissioners is the group-wide supervisor, the commissioner is authorized to reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor. However:

   a. The commissioner's cooperation must be in compliance with the laws of this state; and

   b. The regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor must also recognize and cooperate with the commissioner's activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups where applicable. Where the recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner is authorized to refuse recognition and cooperation.

7. The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official's role as group-wide supervisor.

8. The commissioner may adopt rules necessary for the implementation and administration of this section.

9. A registered insurer subject to this section is liable for and must pay the reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in the administration of this section, including the engagement of attorneys, actuaries, and other professionals and all reasonable travel expenses.

3. In order to assess the business strategy, financial position, legal and regulatory position, risk exposure, risk management, and governance processes, and as part of the examination of individual insurers in accordance with RCW 48.31B.035, the commissioner may participate in a supervisory college with other regulators charged with supervision of the insurer or its affiliates, including other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies. The commissioner may enter into agreements in accordance with RCW 48.31B.038(3) providing the basis for cooperation between the commissioner and the other regulatory agencies, and the activities of the supervisory college.

2. Neither the commissioner nor any person who received documents, materials, or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner or with whom such documents, materials, or other information are shared pursuant to this chapter is permitted or may be required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential documents, materials, or information subject to subsection (1) of this section.

2. No security that is the subject of an agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or that is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of this chapter or of a rule or order of the commissioner under this chapter may be voted at a shareholders' meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes. Any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though the securities were not issued and outstanding, but no action taken at any such meeting may be invalidated by the voting of the securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state have so ordered. If an insurer or the commissioner has reason to believe that a security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of this chapter or of a rule or order of the commissioner under this chapter, the insurer or the commissioner may apply to the superior court for Thurston county or to the court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business to enjoin an offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition made in contravention of RCW 48.31B.015 or a rule or order of the commissioner under that section to enjoin the voting of a security so acquired, to void a vote of the security already cast at a meeting of shareholders, and for such other relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors, and shareholders or the public may require.

3. If a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire voting securities in violation of this chapter or a rule or order of the commissioner under this chapter, the superior court for Thurston county or the court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business may, on such notice as the court deems appropriate, upon the application of the insurer or the commissioner seize or sequester voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by the person, and issue such order with respect to the securities as may be appropriate to carry out this chapter.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this chapter, the situs of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers is in this state.

The commissioner shall pay a fine collected under this section to the state treasurer for the account of the general fund.

2. Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates this chapter, or participates in, or assents to, or who knowingly permits an officer or agent of the insurer to engage in transactions or make investments that have not been properly reported or submitted under RCW 48.31B.025(1) or 48.31B.030(1)(b) or (2), or that violate this chapter, shall pay, in their individual capacity, a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars per violation, after notice and hearing before the commissioner. In determining the amount of the fine, the commissioner shall take into account the appropriateness of the forfeiture with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require.

3. Whenever it appears to the commissioner that an insurer subject to this chapter or a director, officer, employee, or agent of the insurer has engaged in a transaction or entered into a contract that is subject to RCW 48.31B.030 and that would not have been approved had approval been requested, the commissioner may order the insurer to cease and desist immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract. After notice and hearing the commissioner may also order the insurer to void any such contracts and restore the status quo if that action is in the best interest of the policyholders, creditors, or the public.

4. Whenever it appears to the commissioner that an insurer or a director, officer, employee, or agent of the insurer has committed a willful violation of this chapter, the commissioner may refer the matter to the prosecuting attorney of Thurston county or the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located.

The officer, director, or employee upon whom the fine is imposed shall pay the fine in his or her individual capacity.

6. Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has committed a violation of RCW 48.31B.015 and which prevents the full understanding of the enterprise risk to the insurer by affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order of supervision in accordance with RCW 48.31.400.

## 48.31B.055 - Violations of chapter—Impairment of financial condition—Commissioner may take possession.
Whenever it appears to the commissioner that a person has committed a violation of this chapter that so impairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business by it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or the public, the commissioner may proceed as provided in RCW 48.31.030 and 48.31.040 to take possession of the property of the domestic insurer and to conduct the business of the insurer.

2. No such distribution is recoverable if it is shown that when paid, the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

3. A person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate when the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions or payments under subsection (1) of this section the person received. A person who controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared is liable up to the amount of distributions he or she would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they are jointly and severally liable.

4. The maximum amount recoverable under this section is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds.

5. To the extent that a person liable under subsection (3) of this section is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it under those provisions, its parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, is jointly and severally liable for a resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it.
