2. The style, arrangement and over-all appearance of the policy shall give no undue prominence to any portion of the text, and every printed portion of the text of the policy and of any endorsements or attached papers shall be plainly printed in light-faced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform and not less than ten-point with a lower-case unspaced alphabet length not less than one hundred and twenty-point (the "text" shall include all printed matter except the name and address of the insurer, name or title of the policy, the brief description if any, and caption and subcaptions).

3. The exceptions and reductions of indemnity shall be set forth in the policy and, other than those contained in RCW 48.20.042 to *48.20.272, inclusive, shall be printed, at the insurer's option, either included with the benefit provision to which they apply, or under an appropriate caption such as "Exceptions," or "Exceptions and reductions," except that if an exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the policy, a statement of such exception or reduction shall be included with the benefit provision to which it applies.

4. Each such form, including riders and endorsements, shall be identified by a form number in the lower left hand corner of the first page thereof.

5. It shall contain no provision purporting to make any portion of the insurer's charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws a part of the policy unless such portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or classification of risks, or short-rate table filed with the commissioner.

An additional ten percent penalty shall be added to any premium refund due which is not paid within thirty days of return of the policy to the insurer or insurance producer. If a policyholder or purchaser pursuant to such notice, returns the policy to the insurer at its home or branch office or to the insurance producer through whom it was purchased, it shall be void from the beginning and the parties shall be in the same position as if no policy had been issued.

\[ [1951 c 229 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1951c229.pdf?cite=1951%20c%20229%20§%203); \]

## 48.20.028 - Calculation of premiums—Adjusted community rating method—Definitions.
1. Premiums for health benefit plans for individuals shall be calculated using the adjusted community rating method that spreads financial risk across the carrier's entire individual product population, except the individual product population covered under RCW 48.20.029.

   a. The insurer shall develop its rates based on an adjusted community rate and may only vary the adjusted community rate for:

      i. Geographic area;

      ii. Family size;

      iii. Age;

      iv. Tenure discounts; and

      v. Wellness activities.

   b. The adjustment for age in (a)(iii) of this subsection may not use age brackets smaller than five-year increments which shall begin with age twenty and end with age sixty-five. Individuals under the age of twenty shall be treated as those age twenty.

   c. The insurer shall be permitted to develop separate rates for individuals age sixty-five or older for coverage for which medicare is the primary payer and coverage for which medicare is not the primary payer. Both rates shall be subject to the requirements of this subsection.

   d. The permitted rates for any age group shall be no more than four hundred twenty-five percent of the lowest rate for all age groups on January 1, 1996, four hundred percent on January 1, 1997, and three hundred seventy-five percent on January 1, 2000, and thereafter.

   e. A discount for wellness activities shall be permitted to reflect actuarially justified differences in utilization or cost attributed to such programs not to exceed twenty percent.

   f. The rate charged for a health benefit plan offered under this section may not be adjusted more frequently than annually except that the premium may be changed to reflect:

      i. Changes to the family composition;

      ii. Changes to the health benefit plan requested by the individual; or

      iii. Changes in government requirements affecting the health benefit plan.

   g. For the purposes of this section, a health benefit plan that contains a restricted network provision shall not be considered similar coverage to a health benefit plan that does not contain such a provision, provided that the restrictions of benefits to network providers result in substantial differences in claims costs. This subsection does not restrict or enhance the portability of benefits as provided in *RCW 48.43.015.

   h. A tenure discount for continuous enrollment in the health plan of two years or more may be offered, not to exceed ten percent.

2. Adjusted community rates established under this section shall pool the medical experience of all individuals purchasing coverage, except individuals purchasing coverage under RCW 48.20.029, and shall not be required to be pooled with the medical experience of health benefit plans offered to small employers under RCW 48.21.045.

3. As used in this section, "health benefit plan," "adjusted community rate," and "wellness activities" mean the same as defined in RCW 48.43.005.

4. This section shall not apply to premiums for health benefit plans covered under RCW 48.20.029.

RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of two hundred dollars or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.

2. The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (a) until at least age 50 or, (b) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "valid loss of time coverage," approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.

2. Each disability insurance contract providing coverage for medical and surgical services shall provide coverage for:

3. This section does not prohibit a requirement that mental health services be medically necessary, if a comparable requirement is applicable to medical and surgical services.
