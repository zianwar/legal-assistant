\[ [2015 c 19 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5023-S.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%2019%20§%204); [1987 c 185 § 24](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c185.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20185%20§%2024); 1947 c 79 § .19.01; Rem. Supp. 1947 § 45.19.01; \]

## 48.19.020 - Rate standard.
Premium rates for insurance shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.

\[ [1983 1st ex.s. c 32 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983ex1c32.pdf?cite=1983%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2032%20§%2013); 1947 c 79 § .19.02; Rem. Supp. 1947 § 45.19.02; \]

## 48.19.030 - Making of rates—Criteria.
Rates shall be used, subject to the other provisions of this chapter, only if made in accordance with the following provisions:

1. In the case of insurances under standard fire policies and that part of marine and transportation insurances not exempted under RCW 48.19.010, manual, minimum, class or classification rates, rating schedules or rating plans, shall be made and adopted; except as to specific rates on inland marine risks individually rated, which risks are not reasonably susceptible to manual or schedule rating, and which risks by general custom of the business are not written according to manual rates or rating plans.

2. In the case of casualty and surety insurances:

   a. The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group with respect to any kind of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof for which subdivision or combination separate expense provisions are applicable.

   b. Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both. Such standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.

3. Due consideration in making rates for all insurances shall be given to:

   a. Past and prospective loss experience within this state for experience periods acceptable to the commissioner. If the information is not available or is not statistically credible, an insurer may use loss experience in those states which are likely to produce loss experience similar to that in this state.

   b. Conflagration and catastrophe hazards, where present.

   c. A reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies.

   d. Dividends, savings and unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members, or subscribers.

   e. Past and prospective operating expenses.

   f. Past and prospective investment income.

   g. All other relevant factors within and outside this state.

4. In addition to other factors required by this section, rates filed by an insurer on its own behalf may also be related to the insurer's plan of operation and plan of risk classification.

5. Except to the extent necessary to comply with RCW 48.19.020 uniformity among insurers in any matter within the scope of this section is neither required nor prohibited.

\[ [1989 c 25 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c25.pdf?cite=1989%20c%2025%20§%203); 1947 c 79 § .19.03; Rem. Supp. 1947 § 45.19.03; \]

## 48.19.035 - Making of rates—Definitions—Personal insurance—Use of credit history or insurance scores—Rules.

   a. "Affiliate" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 48.31B.005(1).

   b. "Consumer" means an individual policyholder or applicant for insurance.

   c. "Credit history" means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity that is used or expected to be used, or collected in whole or in part, for the purpose of serving as a factor in determining personal insurance premiums or eligibility for coverage.

   d. "Insurance score" means a number or rating that is derived from an algorithm, computer application, model, or other process that is based in whole or in part on credit history.

   e. "Personal insurance" means:

      i. Private passenger automobile coverage;

      ii. Homeowner's coverage, including mobile homeowners, manufactured homeowners, condominium owners, and renter's coverage;

      iii. Dwelling property coverage;

      iv. Earthquake coverage for a residence or personal property;

      v. Personal liability and theft coverage;

      vi. Personal inland marine coverage; and

      vii. Mechanical breakdown coverage for personal auto or home appliances.

2. [Empty]

   a. Credit history shall not be used to determine personal insurance rates, premiums, or eligibility for coverage unless the insurance scoring models are filed with the commissioner. Insurance scoring models include all attributes and factors used in the calculation of an insurance score. RCW 48.19.040(5) does not apply to any information filed under this subsection, and the information shall be withheld from public inspection and kept confidential by the commissioner. All information filed under this subsection shall be considered trade secrets under RCW 48.02.120(3). Information filed under this subsection may be made public by the commissioner for the sole purpose of enforcement actions taken by the commissioner.

   b. Each insurer that uses credit history or an insurance score to determine personal insurance rates, premiums, or eligibility for coverage must file all rates and rating plans for that line of coverage with the commissioner. This requirement applies equally to a single insurer and two or more affiliated insurers. RCW 48.19.040(5) applies to information filed under this subsection except that any eligibility rules or guidelines shall be withheld from public inspection under RCW 48.02.120(3) from the date that the information is filed and after it becomes effective.

3. Insurers shall not use the following types of credit history to calculate a personal insurance score or determine personal insurance premiums or rates:

   a. The absence of credit history or the inability to determine the consumer's credit history, unless the insurer has filed actuarial data segmented by demographic factors in a manner prescribed by the commissioner that demonstrates compliance with RCW 48.19.020;

   b. The number of credit inquiries;

   c. Credit history or an insurance score based on collection accounts identified with a medical industry code;

   d. The initial purchase or finance of a vehicle or house that adds a new loan to the consumer's existing credit history, if evident from the consumer report; however, an insurer may consider the bill payment history of any loan, the total number of loans, or both;

   e. The consumer's use of a particular type of credit card, charge card, or debit card; or

   f. The consumer's total available line of credit; however, an insurer may consider the total amount of outstanding debt in relation to the total available line of credit.

4. If a consumer is charged higher premiums due to disputed credit history, the insurer shall rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term. As rerated, the consumer shall be charged the same premiums they would have been charged if accurate credit history was used to calculate an insurance score. This subsection applies only if the consumer resolves the dispute under the process set forth in the fair credit reporting act and notifies the insurer in writing that the dispute has been resolved.

5. The commissioner may adopt rules to implement this section.

6. This section applies to all personal insurance policies issued or renewed on or after June 30, 2003.

\[ [2004 c 86 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2727.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%2086%20§%201); [2002 c 360 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2544-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20360%20§%202); \]

Every insurer or rating organization shall, before using, file with the commissioner every classifications manual, manual of rules and rates, rating plan, rating schedule, minimum rate, class rate, and rating rule, and every modification of any of the foregoing which it proposes. The insurer need not so file any rate on individually rated risks as described in subdivision (1) of RCW 48.19.030; except that any such specific rate made by a rating organization shall be filed.

2. Every such filing shall indicate the type and extent of the coverage contemplated and must be accompanied by sufficient information to permit the commissioner to determine whether it meets the requirements of this chapter. An insurer or rating organization shall offer in support of any filing:

   a. The experience or judgment of the insurer or rating organization making the filing;

   b. An exhibit detailing the major elements of operating expense for the types of insurance affected by the filing;

   c. An explanation of how investment income has been taken into account in the proposed rates; and

   d. Any other information which the insurer or rating organization deems relevant.

   b. A complete and logical explanation of how it has developed its proposed rates, including the insurer's analysis of any relevant information and showing why the proposed rates should be considered to meet the requirements of RCW 48.19.020.

4. Every such filing shall state its proposed effective date.

5. [Empty]

Supp. 1947 § 45.19.04; \]

## 48.19.043 - Forms of commercial property casualty policies—Legislative intent—Issuance prior to filing—Disapproval by commissioner—Definition.
1. It is the intent of the legislature to assist the purchasers of commercial property casualty insurance by allowing policies to be issued more expeditiously and provide a more competitive market for rates.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 48.19.040(1), commercial property casualty policies may be issued prior to filing the rates. All commercial property casualty rates shall be filed with the commissioner within thirty days after an insurer issues any policy using them.

3. If, within thirty days after a commercial property casualty rate has been filed, the commissioner finds that the rate does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the commissioner shall disapprove the filing and give notice to the insurer or rating organization that made the filing, specifying how the filing fails to meet the requirements and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing shall be deemed no longer effective. The commissioner may extend the time for review another fifteen days by giving notice to the insurer prior to the expiration of the original thirty-day period.

4. Upon a final determination of a disapproval of a rate filing under subsection (3) of this section, the insurer shall issue an endorsement changing the rate to comply with the commissioner's disapproval from the date the rate is no longer effective.

5. For purposes of this section, "commercial property casualty" means insurance pertaining to a business, profession, occupation, nonprofit organization, or public entity for the lines of property and casualty insurance defined in RCW 48.11.040, 48.11.050, 48.11.060, or 48.11.070, but does not mean medical malpractice insurance or portable electronics insurance as defined in RCW 48.120.005.

6. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the disapproval shall not affect any contract made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the notice of disapproval.

7. In the event a hearing is held on the actions of the commissioner under subsection (3) of this section, the burden of proof is on the commissioner.

\[ [2013 c 152 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5008-S.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%20152%20§%203); [2006 c 8 § 216](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2292-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%208%20§%20216); [2003 c 248 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1083.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20248%20§%207); [1997 c 428 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5750-S.SL.pdf?cite=1997%20c%20428%20§%202); \]

## 48.19.050 - Filings by rating bureau.
1. If so authorized by an insurer, the commissioner shall accept, in lieu of filings by the insurer, filings on its behalf made by a rating organization then licensed as provided in this chapter.

2. As to fire insurance under a standard form fire policy, and the following insurances (other than vehicle insurance coverages) when issued as part of a standard form fire policy, an insurer may so authorize a rating organization to make all [of] its filings only, and may not make a portion of such filings upon its own behalf and authorize a rating organization to make other such filings:

   a. Additional property insurance coverages; or

   b. Coverages including any kind of insurance in addition to fire for a single undivided premium.

3. Except, that notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) an insurer which prior to the first day of January, 1947, made its own filings in this state as to a particular class of fire risks, and its filings in this state as to other classes of fire risks were made by a rating organization authorized by the insurer so to do, may:

   a. Continue to make all [of] its own filings as to such specific class of risks or authorize a rating organization to make its filings as to such specific class of risks or any part thereof; and

2. Except as provided in RCW 48.19.070 and 48.19.043:

No such filing shall become effective within thirty days after the date of filing with the commissioner, which period may be extended by the commissioner for an additional period not to exceed fifteen days if he or she gives notice within such waiting period to the insurer or rating organization which made the filing that he or she needs such additional time for the consideration of the filing. The commissioner may, upon application and for cause shown, waive such waiting period or part thereof as to a filing that he or she has not disapproved.

   b. A filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this chapter unless disapproved by the commissioner within the waiting period or any extension thereof.
