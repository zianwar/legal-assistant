## 48.76.020 - Nonforfeiture and cash surrender provisions required.
In the case of policies issued on and after the operative date of this chapter as defined in RCW 48.76.100, no policy of life insurance, except as stated in RCW 48.76.090, may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this chapter and are essentially in compliance with RCW 48.76.080:

1. That, in the event of default in any premium payment, the company will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as may be specified in this chapter. In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the company may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.

2. That, upon surrender of the policy within sixty days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary insurance or five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be specified in this chapter.

3. That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit becomes effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default.

4. That if the policy has become paid-up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be specified in this chapter.

5. That policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first twenty policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the company on the policy.

6. A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered; an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the company on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.

Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.

The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.

\[ [1982 1st ex.s. c 9 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c9.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%209%20§%2011); \]

## 48.76.030 - Amount of cash surrender value.
1. Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by RCW 48.76.020, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in RCW 48.76.050, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, and the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy.

2. For any policy issued on or after the operative date of *RCW 48.76.050(4), which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.

3. For any family policy issued on or after the operative date of *RCW 48.76.050(4), which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age seventy-one, the cash surrender value shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in this section for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in this section for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.

4. Any cash surrender value available within thirty days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid-up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by RCW 48.76.020, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the company on the policy.

\[ [1982 1st ex.s. c 9 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c9.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%209%20§%2012); \]

## 48.76.040 - Nonforfeiture benefit in case of premium default.
Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such anniversary is at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this chapter in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.

\[ [1982 1st ex.s. c 9 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c9.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%209%20§%2013); \]

## 48.76.050 - Calculation of adjusted premiums—Operative date of section.
1. This section does not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (7) of this section. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts stated in the policy as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:

   a. The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;

   b. Two percent of the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined, if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy;

   c. Forty percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year;

   d. Twenty-five percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.

However, in applying the percentages specified in (c) and (d) of this subsection, no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent of the amount of insurance or level amount equivalent thereto. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.

2. In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent level amount thereof for the purpose of this section shall be deemed to be the level amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the inception of the insurance as the benefits under the policy: PROVIDED HOWEVER, That in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by such policy at age ten.

3. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to:

   a. The adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by

   b. The adjusted premiums for such term insurance, with (a) and (b) of this subsection being calculated separately and as specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section except that, for the purposes of subsection (1)(b), (c), and (d) of this section, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in (b) of this subsection shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in (a) of this subsection.

4. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1941 standard ordinary mortality table: PROVIDED, That for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks on or after July 1, 1957, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 standard industrial mortality table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half percent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits: PROVIDED, That in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty percent of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.

5. This subsection does not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (7) of this section. In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1958 standard ordinary mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 16, 1973, and before September 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent per annum may be used and provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured: PROVIDED, That in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioner's 1958 extended term insurance table: PROVIDED FURTHER, That for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.

After June 11, 1959, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this section for such company), this subsection shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such company shall be January 1, 1966.

6. This subsection does not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (7) of this section. In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this chapter, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1961 standard industrial mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 16, 1973, and prior to September 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent per annum may be used: PROVIDED, That in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioner's 1961 industrial extended term insurance table: PROVIDED FURTHER, That for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.

After July 10, 1982, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this section for such company), this subsection shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such company shall be January 1, 1968.

7. [Empty]

   a. This subsection applies to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection as defined herein. Except as provided in (g) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of: (i) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (ii) one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and (iii) one hundred twenty-five percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as defined in (b) of this subsection: PROVIDED, That in applying the percentage specified in (a)(iii) of this subsection no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.

   b. The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.

   c. In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.

   d. Except as otherwise provided in (g) of this subsection, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of:

      i. The sum of

         A.  The then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, and

         B.  The additional expense allowance, if any, over

      ii. The then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.

   e. The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of:

      i. One percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and

      ii. One hundred twenty-five percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.

   f. The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (i) by (ii) where:

      i. Equals the sum of:

         A.  The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and

         B.  The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and

      ii. Equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.

   g. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.

   h. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1980 standard ordinary mortality table or at the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the commissioner's 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with ten-year select mortality factors, shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1961 standard industrial mortality table, and shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this section, for policies issued in that calendar year, subject to the following provisions:

   i. At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this section, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.

      ii. Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by RCW 48.76.020, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.

      iii. A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.

      iv. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioner's 1980 extended term insurance table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the commissioner's 1961 industrial extended term insurance table for policies of industrial insurance.

      v. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables.

      vi. Any ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioner's 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioner's 1980 extended term insurance table.

      vii. Any industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioner's 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioner's 1961 industrial extended term insurance table.

      viii. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioner's standard ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by rules adopted by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table.

For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual must provide the commissioners standard mortality for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table. If the commissioner approves by rule any commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then the minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforteiture standard provided by the valuation manual.

      ix. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by rule adopted by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table.

For policies issued on or after the effective date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual must provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table. If the commissioner approves by rule any commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.

      i. [Empty]

         A.  For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the standard valuation law (chapter 48.74 RCW), rounded to the nearer one quarter of one percent. However, the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than four percent.

         B.  For policies issued on and after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year must be provided by the valuation manual.

   j. Notwithstanding any other provision in this title to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.

   k. After July 10, 1982, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this section for such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such company shall be January 1, 1989.

## 48.76.060 - Requirements when specified methods of minimum values determination unfeasible.
In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in RCW 48.76.020 through 48.76.050, then:

1. The commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by RCW 48.76.020 through 48.76.050;

2. The commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;

3. The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this chapter, as determined by regulations promulgated by the commissioner.

Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in RCW 48.76.030 through 48.76.050 may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 48.76.030, additional benefits payable: (1) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means; (2) in the event of total and permanent disability; (3) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; (4) as term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this chapter would not apply; (5) as term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; and (6) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this chapter, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.

## 48.76.080 - Cash surrender value required for policies issued on or after January 1, 1986.
1. This section, in addition to all other applicable sections of this chapter, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of: (a) The greater of zero and the basic cash value specified in subsection (2) of this section; and (b) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the company under the policy.

2. The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as defined in subsection (3) of this section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary: PROVIDED, That the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in RCW 48.76.030 or * 48.76.050(4), whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in RCW 48.76.030 or * 48.76.050(4), whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that section.

3. The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in *RCW 48.76.050 (1) or (4). Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:

   a. Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of: (i) The fifth policy anniversary; and (ii) The first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and

   b. Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in subparagraph (a) of this subsection may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years: PROVIDED, That no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in *RCW 48.76.050 (1) or (4), whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.

4. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other sections of this chapter. The cash surrender values referred to in this section shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.

5. Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in RCW 48.76.020 through 48.76.040, * 48.76.050(4), and 48.76.070. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed in RCW 48.76.070 shall conform with the principles of this section.
