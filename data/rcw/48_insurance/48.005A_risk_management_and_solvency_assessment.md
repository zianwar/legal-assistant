## 48.05A.005 - Purpose—Application—Findings—Intent.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the requirements for maintaining a risk management framework and completing an own risk and solvency assessment and provide guidance and instructions for filing an ORSA summary report with the insurance commissioner of this state.

2. The requirements of this chapter apply to all insurers domiciled in this state unless exempt pursuant to RCW 48.05A.030.

3. The legislature finds and declares that the ORSA summary report contains confidential and sensitive information related to an insurer or insurance group's identification of risks material and relevant to the insurer or insurance group filing the report. This information includes proprietary and trade secret information that has the potential for harm and competitive disadvantage to the insurer or insurance group if the information is made public. It is the intent of this legislature that the ORSA summary report is a confidential document filed with the commissioner, that the ORSA summary report may be shared only as stated in this chapter and to assist the commissioner in the performance of his or her duties, and that in no event may the ORSA summary report be subject to public disclosure.

3. An insurer may comply with subsection (1) of this section by providing the most recent and substantially similar report or reports provided by the insurer or another member of an insurance group of which the insurer is a member to the commissioner of another state or to a supervisor or regulator of a foreign jurisdiction, if that report provides information that is comparable to the information described in the ORSA guidance manual. Any such report in a language other than English must be accompanied by a translation of that report into the English language.

## 48.05A.030 - Insurer exemptions from chapter—Qualifying conditions—Reports.

   b. The insurance group of which the insurer is a member has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium including international direct and assumed premium, but excluding premium reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, less than one billion dollars.

2. If an insurer qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, then the ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to RCW 48.05A.025 must include every insurer within the insurance group. This requirement is satisfied by the submission of more than one ORSA summary report for any combination of insurers, provided any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.

3. If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section, then the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to RCW 48.05A.025 is the report applicable to that insurer.

4. If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, the insurer may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this chapter based upon unique circumstances. In deciding whether to grant the insurer's request for waiver, the commissioner may consider the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, and any other factor the commissioner considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member. If the insurer is a part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one state, the commissioner shall coordinate with the lead state commissioner and with the other domiciliary commissioners in considering whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.

5. Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section, the commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA, and file an ORSA summary report (a) based on unique circumstances including, but not limited to, the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests, and international supervisor requests; and (b) if the insurer has risk-based capital at the company action level event as set forth in RCW 48.05.440 or 48.43.310, meets one or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition as defined in WAC 284-16-310, or otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the commissioner.

6. If an insurer that qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to changes in premium reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer has one year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirement of this chapter.
