3. The commissioner shall not authorize a domestic reciprocal insurer so to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it qualifies to and does extinguish such liability of all its subscribers and in all such policies for all kinds of insurance transacted by it. Except, that if required by the laws of another state in which the insurer is transacting insurance as an authorized insurer, the insurer may issue policies providing for the contingent liability of such of its subscribers as may acquire such policies in such state, and need not extinguish the contingent liability applicable to policies theretofore in force in such state.

## 48.10.340 - Impairment of assets—Procedure.
1. If the assets of a domestic reciprocal insurer are at any time insufficient to discharge its liabilities other than any liability on account of funds contributed by the attorney, and to maintain the surplus required for the kinds of insurance it is authorized to transact, its attorney shall forthwith levy an assessment upon subscribers made subject to assessment by the terms of their policies for the amount needed to make up the deficiency.

2. If the attorney fails to make the assessment within thirty days after the commissioner orders him or her to do so, or if the deficiency is not fully made up within sixty days after the date the assessment was made, the insurer shall be deemed insolvent and shall be proceeded against as authorized by this code.

3. If liquidation of such an insurer is ordered, an assessment shall be levied upon the subscribers for such an amount, subject to limits as provided by this chapter, as the commissioner determines to be necessary to discharge all liabilities of the insurer, exclusive of any funds contributed by the attorney, but including the reasonable cost of the liquidation.
