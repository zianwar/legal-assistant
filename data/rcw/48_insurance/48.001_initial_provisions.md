   b. Enroll the child under family coverage upon application of the child's other parent, health care authority as the state medicaid agency under RCW 74.09.500, or child support enforcement program, if the parent is enrolled but fails to make application to obtain coverage for such child; and

   c. Not disenroll, or eliminate coverage of, such child who is otherwise eligible for the coverage unless the issuer or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan is provided satisfactory written evidence that:

      i. The court order is no longer in effect; or

      ii. The child is or will be enrolled in comparable health coverage through another issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, which will take effect not later than the effective date of disenrollment.

5. An issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, that has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for medical assistance under medicaid and coverage for health benefits from the issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, may not impose requirements on the health care authority that are different from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other individual so covered.
