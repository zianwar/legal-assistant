## 48.29.010 - Scope of chapter—Definitions.
1. This chapter relates only to title insurers for real property.

2. This code does not apply to persons engaged in the business of preparing and issuing abstracts of title to property and certifying to their correctness so long as the persons do not guarantee or insure the titles.

3. For purposes of this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

An abstract of title is not a title policy as defined in this subsection.

   b. [Empty]

      i. "Advisory organization" means a group, association, or other organization of insurers that assists insurers or rating organizations in rate making by the collection and furnishing of loss or expense statistics, or by the submission of recommendations, but that does not make filings under this chapter.

   c. "Associates of producers" means any person who has one or more of the following relationships with a producer of title insurance business:

      i. A spouse, parent, or child of a producer;

   e. "Member" means an insurer that participates in or is entitled to participate in the management of a rating organization or an advisory organization.

   f. "Preliminary report," "commitment," or "binder" means reports furnished in connection with an application for title insurance and are offers to issue a title policy subject to the stated exceptions in the reports, the conditions and stipulations of the report and the issued policy, and other matters as may be incorporated by reference. The reports are not abstracts of title, nor are any of the rights, duties, or responsibilities applicable to the preparation and issuance of an abstract of title applicable to the issuance of any report. The report is not a representation as to the condition of the title to real property, but is a statement of terms and conditions upon which the issuer is willing to issue its title policy, if the offer is accepted.

   g. "Producers of title insurance business" means real estate agents and brokers, lawyers, mortgagees, mortgage loan brokers, financial institutions, escrow agents, persons who lend money for the purchase of real estate or interests therein, building contractors, real estate developers and subdividers, and any other person who is or may be in a position to influence the selection of a title insurer or title insurance agent whether or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained with respect to the selection of the title insurer or title insurance agent.

## 48.29.120 - Reserve requirements.
In determining the financial condition of a title insurer doing business under this title, the general provisions of chapter 48.12 RCW requiring the establishment of reserves sufficient to cover all known and unknown liabilities including allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expense apply, except that a title insurer shall establish and maintain:

1. A known claim reserve in an amount estimated to be sufficient to cover all unpaid losses, claims, and allocated loss adjustment expenses arising under title insurance policies, guaranteed certificates of title, guaranteed searches, and guaranteed abstracts of title, and all unpaid losses, claims, and allocated loss adjustment expenses for which the title insurer may be liable, and for which the insurer has received notice by or on behalf of the insured, holder of a guarantee or escrow, or security depositor;

2. [Empty]

   a. A statutory or unearned premium reserve consisting of:

      i. The amount of the special reserve fund that was required prior to July 24, 2005, which balance must be released in accordance with (b) of this subsection; and

      ii. Additions to the reserve after July 24, 2005, must be made out of total charges for title insurance policies and guarantees written, as set forth in the title insurer's most recent annual statement on file with the commissioner, equal to the sum of the following:

          A.  For each title insurance policy on a single risk written or assumed after July 24, 2005, fifteen cents per one thousand dollars of net retained liability for policies under five hundred thousand dollars; and

          B.  For each title insurance policy on a single risk written or assumed after July 24, 2005, ten cents per one thousand dollars of net retained liability for policies of five hundred thousand or greater.

   b. The aggregate of the amounts set aside in this reserve in any calendar year pursuant to (a) of this subsection must be released from the reserve and restored to net profits over a period of twenty years under the following formula:

      i. Thirty-five percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of the year next succeeding the year of addition;

      ii. Fifteen percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of each of the succeeding two years;

      iii. Ten percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of the next succeeding year;

      iv. Three percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of each of the next three succeeding years;

      v. Two percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of each of the next three succeeding years; and

      vi. One percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of each of the next succeeding ten years.

   c. The insurer shall calculate an adjusted statutory unearned premium reserve as of July 24, 2005. The adjusted reserve is calculated as if (a)(ii) and (b) of this subsection had been in effect for all years beginning twenty years prior to July 24, 2005. For purposes of this calculation, the balance of the reserve as of that date is deemed to be zero. If the adjusted reserve so calculated exceeds the aggregate amount set aside for statutory or unearned premiums in the insurer's annual statement on file with the commissioner on July 24, 2005, the insurer shall, out of total charges for policies of title insurance, increase its statutory or unearned premium reserve by an amount equal to one-sixth of that excess in each of the succeeding six years, commencing with the calendar year that includes July 24, 2005, until the entire excess has been added.

   d. The aggregate of the amounts set aside in this reserve in any calendar year as adjustments to the insurer's statutory or unearned premium reserve under (c) of this subsection shall be released from the reserve and restored to net profits, or equity if the additions required by (c) of this subsection reduced equity directly, over a period not exceeding ten years under to the [under the] following table:

3. A supplemental reserve shall be established consisting of any other reserves necessary, when taken in combination with the reserves required by subsections (1) and (2) of this section, to cover the company's liabilities with respect to all losses, claims, and loss adjustment expenses.

4. The supplemental reserve required under subsection (3) of this section shall be phased in as follows: Twenty-five percent of the otherwise applicable supplemental reserve is required until December 31, 2006; fifty percent of the otherwise applicable supplemental reserve is required until December 31, 2007; and seventy-five percent of the otherwise applicable supplemental reserve is required until December 31, 2008.

1. Premium rates for the insuring or guaranteeing of titles shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.

2. Each title insurer shall forthwith file with the commissioner a schedule showing the premium rates to be charged by it.

3. The commissioner may order the modification of any premium rate or schedule of premium rates found by him or her after a hearing to be excessive, or inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. No such order shall require retroactive modification.

   a. A fidelity bond or fidelity insurance providing coverage in the aggregate amount of two hundred thousand dollars with a deductible no greater than ten thousand dollars covering the applicant and each corporate officer, partner, escrow officer, and employee of the applicant conducting the business of an escrow agent as defined in RCW 18.44.011 and exempt from licensing under *RCW 18.44.021(6), or a guarantee from a licensed title insurance company as authorized by subsection (5) of this section; and

   b. A surety bond in the amount of ten thousand dollars executed by the applicant as obligor and by a surety company authorized, or eligible under chapter 48.15 RCW, to do a surety business in this state as surety, or some other security approved by the commissioner, unless the fidelity bond or fidelity insurance obtained by the licensee to satisfy the requirement in (a) of this subsection does not have a deductible. The bond shall run to the state of Washington as obligee, and shall run to the benefit of the state and any person or persons who suffer loss by reason of the applicant's or its employee's violation of this chapter. The bond shall be conditioned that the obligor as licensee will faithfully conform to and abide by this chapter and all rules adopted under this chapter, and shall reimburse all persons who suffer loss by reason of a violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. The bond shall be continuous and may be canceled by the surety upon the surety giving written notice to the commissioner of its intent to cancel the bond. The cancellation shall be effective thirty days after the notice is received by the commissioner. Whether or not the bond is renewed, continued, reinstated, reissued, or otherwise extended, replaced, or modified, including increases or decreases in the penal sum, it shall be considered one continuous obligation, and the surety upon the bond shall not be liable in an aggregate amount exceeding the penal sum set forth on the face of the bond. In no event shall the penal sum, or any portion thereof, at two or more points in time be added together in determining the surety's liability. The bond is not liable for any penalties imposed on the licensee, including but not limited to any increased damages or attorneys' fees, or both, awarded under RCW 19.86.090.

2. For the purposes of this section, a "fidelity bond" means a primary commercial blanket bond or its equivalent satisfactory to the commissioner and written by an insurer authorized, or eligible under chapter 48.15 RCW, to transact this line of business in the state of Washington. The bond shall provide fidelity coverage for any fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by any one or more of the employees, officers, or owners as defined in the bond, acting alone or in collusion with others. The bond shall be for the sole benefit of the title insurance agent and under no circumstances whatsoever shall the bonding company be liable under the bond to any other party. The bond shall name the title insurance agent as obligee and shall protect the obligee against the loss of money or other real or personal property belonging to the obligee, or in which the obligee has a pecuniary interest, or for which the obligee is legally liable or held by the obligee in any capacity, whether the obligee is legally liable therefor or not. The bond may be canceled by the insurer upon delivery of thirty days' written notice to the commissioner and to the title insurance agent.

3. For the purposes of this section, "fidelity insurance" means employee dishonesty insurance or its equivalent satisfactory to the commissioner and written by an insurer authorized, or eligible under chapter 48.15 RCW, to transact this line of business in the state of Washington. The insurance shall provide coverage for any fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by any one or more of the employees, officers, or owners as defined in the policy of insurance, acting alone or in collusion with others. The insurance shall be for the sole benefit of the title insurance agent and under no circumstances whatsoever shall the insurance company be liable under the insurance to any other party. The insurance shall name the title insurance agent as the named insured and shall protect the named insured against the loss of money or other real or personal property belonging to the named insured, or in which the named insured has a pecuniary interest, or for which the named insured is legally liable or held by the named insured in any capacity, whether the named insured is legally liable therefor or not. The insurance coverage may be canceled by the insurer upon delivery of thirty days' written notice to the commissioner and to the title insurance agent.

4. The fidelity bond or fidelity insurance, and the surety bond or other form of security approved by the commissioner, shall be kept in full force and effect as a condition precedent to the title insurance agent's authority to transact business in this state, and the title insurance agent shall supply the commissioner with satisfactory evidence thereof upon request.

5. A title insurance company authorized to do business in Washington under RCW 48.05.030 may provide a guarantee in a form satisfactory to the commissioner accepting financial responsibility, up to the aggregate amount of two hundred thousand dollars, for any fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by any one or more of the employees, officers, or owners of a title insurance agent that is appointed as the title insurance company's agent. A title insurance company providing a guarantee as permitted under this subsection may only do so on behalf of its properly appointed title insurance agents. If the title insurance agent is an agent for two or more title insurance companies, any liability under the guarantee shall be borne by the title insurance company for those escrows for which a title insurance commitment or policy was issued on behalf of that title insurance company. If no commitment or policy was issued regarding the escrow for which moneys were lost, including but not limited to collection escrows, each title insurance company, for which the agent was appointed at the time of the fraudulent or dishonest act, shares in the liability. The liability will be shared proportionally, as follows: The premium the agent remitted to the title insurance company in the year prior to the fraudulent or dishonest act will be compared to the total premium the agent remitted to all title insurance companies, for whom the title insurance agent was appointed, during the same period.

6. All title insurance agents licensed on or before July 24, 2005, shall comply with this section within thirty days following July 24, 2005.
