## 48.135.005 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter and sections 14 through 17, chapter 284, Laws of 2006 is to confront the problem of insurance fraud in this state by making a concerted effort to detect insurance fraud, reduce the occurrence of fraud through criminal enforcement and deterrence, require restitution of fraudulently obtained insurance benefits and expenses incurred by an insurer in investigating fraudulent claims, and reduce the amount of premium dollars used to pay fraudulent claims. The primary focus of the insurance fraud program is on organized fraudulent activities committed against insurance companies.
