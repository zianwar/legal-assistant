## 48.37.005 - Short title.
This chapter may be known and cited as the market conduct oversight law.

\[ [2007 c 82 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5717-S.SL.pdf?cite=2007%20c%2082%20§%202); \]

## 48.37.010 - Purpose—Intent.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a framework for the commissioner's market conduct actions, including:

   a. Processes and systems for identifying, assessing, and prioritizing market conduct problems that have a substantial adverse impact on consumers, policyholders, and claimants;

   b. Market conduct actions by the commissioner to substantiate such market conduct problems and a means to remedy significant market conduct problems; and

   c. Procedures to communicate and coordinate market conduct actions among state insurance regulators to foster the most efficient and effective use of resources.

2. It is the intent of the legislature that the market analysis or market conduct process utilize available technology in the least intrusive and most cost-efficient manner to develop a baseline understanding of the marketplace and to identify insurers or practices that deviate significantly from the norm or that pose a potential risk to the insurance consumer. It is also the intent of the legislature that this process include discretion for the commissioner to use market conduct examinations when the continuum of available market conduct actions have not sufficiently addressed issues concerning insurer activities in Washington, or when the continuum of available market conduct actions are not reasonably expected to address issues concerning insurer activities in Washington.

3. It is further the intent of the legislature that the commissioner work with the national association of insurance commissioners toward development of an accreditation process for market conduct oversight and an effective process for domestic deference that creates protections for Washington consumers and efficient and effective regulation of the industry.

2. "Commissioner" means the insurance commissioner of this state.

3. "Complaint" means a written or documented oral communication primarily expressing a grievance, meaning an expression of dissatisfaction.

4. "Insurer" means every person engaged in the business of making contracts of insurance and includes every such entity regardless of name which is regulated by this title.

6. "Market conduct action" means any of the full range of activities that the commissioner may initiate to assess and address the market conduct practices of insurers admitted to do business in this state, and entities operating illegally in this state, beginning with market analysis and extending to examinations. The commissioner's activities to resolve an individual consumer complaint or other report of a specific instance of misconduct are not market conduct actions for purposes of this chapter.

7. "Market conduct oversight personnel" means those individuals employed or contracted by the commissioner to collect, analyze, review, or act on information on the insurance marketplace that identifies patterns or practices of insurers.

"Market conduct examination" means the examination of the insurance operations of an insurer licensed to do business in this state and entities operating illegally in this state, in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of this state. A market conduct examination may be either a comprehensive examination or a targeted examination. A market conduct examination is separate and distinct from a financial examination of any insurer performed pursuant to chapter 48.03, 48.44, or 48.46 RCW, but may be conducted at the same time.

16. "Insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document" means documents prepared as a result of or in connection with an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit. An insurance compliance self-evaluative audit document may include:

    a. A written response to the findings of an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit;

    b. Any supporting information that is collected or developed for the primary purpose and in the course of an insurance compliance self-evaluative audit, including but not limited to field notes and records of observations, findings, opinions, suggestions, conclusions, drafts, memoranda, drawings, photographs, exhibits, computer-generated or electronically recorded information, phone records, maps, charts, graphs, and surveys;

       ii. Memoranda and documents analyzing portions or all of the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit report and discussing potential implementation issues;

       iii. An implementation plan that addresses correcting past noncompliance, improving current compliance, and preventing future noncompliance; or

       iv. Analytic data generated in the course of conducting the insurance compliance self-evaluative audit.

## 48.37.040 - Market analysis procedures—Commissioner's duties—Rules.
1. [Empty]

   a. The commissioner shall collect and report market data information to the NAIC's market information systems, including the complaint database system, the examination tracking system, the regulatory retrieval system, other successor systems, or to additional systems as the commissioner determines is necessary for market analysis.

   b. Market data and information that is collected and maintained by the commissioner shall be compiled and submitted in a manner that meets the requirements of the NAIC and its systems.

2. [Empty]

   a. Each entity subject to the provisions of this chapter shall file a market conduct annual statement or successor product, in the general form and context, in the time frame required by, and according to instructions provided by the NAIC, for each line of business written in the state of Washington. If a particular line of business does not have an approved market conduct annual statement form, the company is not required to file a report for that line of business until such time as [the] NAIC adopts an annual statement form for that line of business.

   b. The commissioner may, for good cause, grant an extension of time for filing a market conduct annual statement, if written application for extension is received at least five business days before the filing due date. Any insurer that fails to file its market conduct annual statement when due or by the end of any extension of time for filing, which the commissioner in his or her sole discretion may have granted, is subject to the penalty and enforcement provisions applicable to the insurer as found in the Washington insurance code.

3. [Empty]

   a. The commissioner shall gather information from data currently available to the commissioner, surveys, required reports, information collected by the NAIC, other sources in both the public or private sectors, and information from within and outside the insurance industry. The commissioner may request insurers to submit data and information that is necessary to conduct market analysis and shall adopt rules that provide for access to records and compliance with the request, that do not cause undue burden or cost to the consumer or insurer.

   b. The information shall be analyzed in order to develop a baseline understanding of the marketplace and to identify for further review insurers or practices that deviate significantly from the norm or that may pose a potential risk to the insurance consumer. The commissioner shall use the NAIC market regulation handbook as one resource in performing this analysis.

   c. The commissioner shall adopt by rule a process for verification by an insurer of Washington state-specific complaint information concerning that insurer before using the complaint information for market conduct surveillance purposes or transmitting it to NAIC databases after July 1, 2007.

4. [Empty]

   a. If the commissioner determines, as a result of market analysis, that further inquiry into a particular insurer or practice is needed, the following continuum of market actions may be considered before conducting a market conduct examination. The commissioner shall not be required to follow the exact sequence of market conduct actions in the continuum or to use all actions in the continuum. As part of the chosen continuum action, the commissioner must discuss with the insurer the data used to choose the option and provide the insurer with an opportunity for data verification at that time. These actions may include, but are not limited to:

      i. Correspondence with the insurer;

      ii. Insurer interviews;

      iii. Information gathering;

      iv. Policy and procedure reviews;

      v. Interrogatories;

      vi. Review of insurer self-evaluation and compliance programs. This may include consideration of the insurer's membership in a best practices organization, if the commissioner is satisfied that the organization's qualification process is likely to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with pertinent insurance laws;

      vii. Desk examinations; and

      viii. Investigations.

   b. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the commissioner shall select the least intrusive and most cost-effective market conduct action that the commissioner determines will provide the necessary protections for consumers.

5. The commissioner shall take those steps reasonably necessary to eliminate duplicative inquiries. The commissioner shall not request insurers to submit data or information provided as part of an insurer's annual financial statement, the annual market conduct statement of the NAIC, or other required schedules, surveys, or reports that are regularly submitted to the commissioner, or with data requests made by other states if that information is available to the commissioner, unless the information is state specific. The commissioner shall coordinate market conduct actions and findings with other state insurance regulators.

6. For purposes of conducting an examination or other market conduct action on an insurer, the commissioner may examine or conduct a market conduct action on any managing general agent or other person, insofar as that examination or market conduct action is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the examination or market conduct action of the insurer.

## 48.37.050 - Protocols for market conduct actions—Rules—Report to the legislature.
