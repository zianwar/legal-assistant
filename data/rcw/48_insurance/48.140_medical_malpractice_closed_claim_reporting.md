## 48.140.020 - Closed claim reporting requirements.
1. For claims closed on or after January 1, 2008:

   a. Every insuring entity or self-insurer that provides medical malpractice insurance to any facility or provider in Washington state must report each medical malpractice closed claim to the commissioner.

   b. If a claim is not covered by an insuring entity or self-insurer, the facility or provider named in the claim must report it to the commissioner after a final claim disposition has occurred due to a court proceeding or a settlement by the parties.

Instances in which a claim may not be covered by an insuring entity or self-insurer include, but are not limited to, situations in which the:

      i. Facility or provider did not buy insurance or maintained a self-insured retention that was larger than the final judgment or settlement;

      ii. Claim was denied by an insuring entity or self-insurer because it did not fall within the scope of the insurance coverage agreement; or

      iii. Annual aggregate coverage limits had been exhausted by other claim payments.

   c. If a facility or provider is insured by a risk retention group and the risk retention group refuses to report closed claims and asserts that the federal liability risk retention act (95 Stat. 949; 15 U.S.C. Sec. 3901 et seq.) preempts state law, the facility or provider must report all data required by this chapter on behalf of the risk retention group.

   d. If a facility or provider is insured by an unauthorized insurer and the unauthorized insurer refuses to report closed claims and asserts a federal exemption or other jurisdictional preemption, the facility or provider must report all data required by this chapter on behalf of the unauthorized insurer.

2. Beginning in 2009, reports required under subsection (1) of this section must be filed by March 1st, and include data for all claims closed in the preceding calendar year and any adjustments to data reported in prior years. The commissioner may adopt rules that require insuring entities, self-insurers, facilities, or providers to file closed claim data electronically.

3. The commissioner may impose a fine of up to two hundred fifty dollars per day against any insuring entity, except a risk retention group, that violates the requirements of this section.

4. The department of health, department of licensing, or department of social and health services may require a provider or facility to take corrective action to assure compliance with the requirements of this section.
