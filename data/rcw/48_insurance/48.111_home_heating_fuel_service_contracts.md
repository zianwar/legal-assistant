## 48.111.005 - Findings—Purpose.
The legislature finds that certain service contracts involving providers of home heating fuel and homeowners are in the public interest. The legislature further finds that the existing statutory provisions regulating service contracts are more burdensome than is necessary to safeguard homeowners from the risk that a contract obligor will close or be unable to fulfill their contract obligations. The legislature declares that it is necessary to establish separate standards that will safeguard certain homeowners from possible losses arising from the cessation of business of a home heating fuel company or the mismanagement of funds paid for home heating fuel service contracts. The purpose of this chapter is to create a legal framework within which home heating fuel service contracts may be sold in this state and set forth requirements for conducting a service contract business.

\[ [2006 c 36 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2776-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%2036%20§%204); \]

## 48.111.040 - Obligations of contract provider.
1. Home heating fuel service contracts may not be issued, sold, or offered for sale in this state or sold to consumers in this state unless the contract provider has:

   a. Provided a receipt for, or other written evidence of, the purchase of the home heating fuel service contract to the contract holder; and

   b. Provided a copy of the home heating fuel service contract to the service contract holder within a reasonable period of time from the date of purchase.

2. In order to assure the faithful performance of a home heating fuel service contract provider's obligations to its contract holders, every home heating fuel service contract provider is responsible for complying with the requirements of one of the following:

   a. Insure all home heating fuel service contracts under a reimbursement insurance policy issued by an insurer holding a certificate of authority from the commissioner; or

   b. [Empty]

      i. Maintain a funded reserve account for its obligations under its home heating service contracts issued and outstanding in this state. The reserves may not be less than forty percent of the gross consideration received, less claims paid, on the sale of the home heating fuel service contract for all in-force contracts. The reserve account is subject to examination and review by the insurance commissioner; and

      ii. Place in trust with the commissioner a financial security deposit, having a value of not less than five percent of the gross consideration received, less claims paid, on the sale of the service contract for all service contracts issued and in force, but not less than ten thousand dollars, consisting of one of the following:

          A.  A surety bond issued by an insurer holding a certificate of authority from the commissioner;

          D.  An evergreen letter of credit issued by a qualified financial institution;

          E.  A pledged certificate of deposit issued by a qualified financial institution; or

          F.  Another form of security prescribed by rule by the commissioner.

3. Home heating fuel service contracts must require the contract provider to permit the contract holder to return the home heating fuel service contract within thirty days of the date the home heating fuel service contract was delivered to the contract holder, or within a longer time period permitted under the home heating fuel service contract. Upon return of the home heating fuel service contract to the contract provider within the applicable period, if no claim has been made under the home heating fuel service contract prior to the return to the contract provider, the home heating fuel service contract is void and the contract provider shall refund to the contract holder, or credit the account of the contract holder with the full purchase price of the home heating fuel service contract. The right to void the home heating fuel service contract provided in this subsection is not transferable and applies only to the original contract purchaser. A ten percent penalty per month must be added to a refund of the purchase price that is not paid or credited within thirty days after return of the home heating fuel service contract to the contract provider.

4. Except for home heating fuel service contract providers, persons marketing, selling, or offering to sell home heating service contracts for providers are exempt from the registration requirements of this chapter.

5. The marketing, sale, offering for sale, issuance, making, proposing to make, and administration of home heating fuel service contracts by contract providers and related contract sellers, administrators, and other persons complying with this chapter are exempt from the other provisions of this title, except chapter 48.04 RCW and as otherwise provided in this chapter.

\[ [2006 c 36 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2776-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%2036%20§%205); \]

## 48.111.050 - Reimbursement insurance policies insuring home heating fuel service contracts.
1. Reimbursement insurance policies insuring home heating fuel service contracts issued, sold, or offered for sale in this state or sold to consumers in this state must state that the insurer that issued the reimbursement insurance policy shall reimburse or pay on behalf of the contract provider all sums the contract provider is legally obligated to pay, including but not limited to the refund of the full purchase price of the contract to the contract holder or shall provide the service which the contract provider is legally obligated to perform according to the contract provider's contractual obligations under the home heating fuel service contracts issued or sold by the contract provider.

2. The reimbursement insurance policy must fully insure the obligations of the contract provider, rather than partially insure, or insure only in the event of contract provider default.

3. The reimbursement insurance policy must state that the contract holder is entitled to apply directly to the reimbursement insurance company.

\[ [2006 c 36 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2776-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%2036%20§%206); \]

## 48.111.053 - Termination of reimbursement insurance policies.
As applicable, an insurer that issued a reimbursement insurance policy shall not terminate the policy until a notice of termination in accordance with RCW 48.18.290 has been given to the home heating fuel service contract provider and has been delivered to the commissioner. The termination of a reimbursement insurance policy does not reduce the issuer's responsibility for home heating fuel service contracts issued by contract providers prior to the effective date of the termination.

\[ [2006 c 36 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2776-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%2036%20§%2010); \]

## 48.111.055 - Insurer issuing reimbursement insurance policy—Contract provider is agent.
1. Home heating fuel service contract providers are the agent of the insurer that issued the reimbursement insurance policy for purposes of obligating the insurer to contract holders in accordance with the home heating fuel service contract and this chapter. Payment of the provider fee by the consumer to the home heating fuel service contract seller, contract provider, or administrator constitutes payment by the consumer to the home heating fuel service contract provider and to the insurer that issued the reimbursement insurance policy. In cases when a contract provider is acting as an administrator and enlists other contract providers, the contract provider acting as the administrator shall notify the insurer of the existence and identities of the other contract providers.

2. This chapter does not prevent or limit the right of an insurer that issued a reimbursement insurance policy to seek indemnification or subrogation against a home heating fuel service contract provider if the issuer pays or is obligated to pay the contract holder sums that the contract provider was obligated to pay under the provisions of the home heating fuel service contract.

\[ [2006 c 36 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2776-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%2036%20§%2011); \]

The contract provider of the home heating fuel service contract shall mail a written notice to the contract holder at the last known address of the contract holder contained in the records of the contract provider at least twenty-one days prior to cancellation by the contract provider. The notice must state the effective date of the cancellation and the true and actual reason for the cancellation.

12. Home heating fuel service contracts must state whether or not the home heating fuel service contract provides for or excludes consequential damages or preexisting conditions.

13.
