Therefore, the legislature provides a mandate that upon the insolvency of a non-United States insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund its United States obligations in accordance with this subchapter, the assets representing the security must be maintained in the United States and claims must be filed with and valued by the state insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight, and the assets distributed, in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic United States insurance companies. The legislature declares that the matters contained in this subchapter are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1011-1012.

## 48.12.425 - Assuming insurer maintains a trust fund—Payment of valid claims—Requirements.
1. Credit is allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in RCW 48.12.465(2), for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. To enable the commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer must report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the national association of insurance commissioners annual statement form by licensed insurers. The assuming insurer must submit to examination of its books and records by the commissioner and bear the expense of examination.

2. [Empty]

   a. Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this section unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by:

      i. The commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled; or

      ii. The commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.

   b. The form of the trust and any trust amendments also must be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument must provide that contested claims are valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust must vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer's United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination as determined by the commissioner.

By February 28th of each year the trustee of the trust must report to the commissioner in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31st.

3. The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurer:

   a. The trust fund for a single assuming insurer consists of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers, and, in addition, the assuming insurer must maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars, except as provided in (b) of this subsection.

   b. At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and must consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than thirty percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust.

   c. [Empty]

      i. In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:

         A.  For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment, or renewal date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter of the group;

         B.  For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before December 31, 1992, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of this subchapter, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States; and

         C.  In addition to these trusts, the group must maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars is held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.

      ii. The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and are subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

      iii. Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group must provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the group.

   d. In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group must:

      i. Have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to making application for accreditation;

      ii. Maintain aggregate policyholders' surplus of at least ten billion dollars;

      iii. Maintain a trust fund in an amount not less than the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group;

      iv. In addition, maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars is held jointly for the benefit of United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for these liabilities; and

      v. Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, make available to the commissioner an annual certification of each underwriter member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by its independent public accountant.

## 48.12.430 - Assuming insurer—Certified as reinsurer—Eligibility requirements—Insurer obligations—Commissioner's duties.
Credit is allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this section.

1. In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer must meet the following requirements:

   a. The assuming insurer must be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (3) of this section;

   b. The assuming insurer must maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the commissioner by rule;

   c. The assuming insurer must maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the commissioner by rule;

   d. The assuming insurer must agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment;

   e. The assuming insurer must agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis; and

   f. The assuming insurer must satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the commissioner.

2. An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer. In order to be eligible for certification, in addition to satisfying the requirements of subsection (1) of this section:

   a. The association must satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents (net of liabilities) of the association and its members, which includes a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the commissioner to provide adequate protection;

   b. The incorporated members of the association must not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and must be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and

   c. Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association must provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.

3. The commissioner must create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such a jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner as a certified reinsurer.

   a. In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner must evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction must agree to share information and cooperate with the commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the commissioner.

   b. A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the national association of insurance commissioners' committee process. The commissioner must consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions. If the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the commissioner must provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed by rule.

   c. United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the national association of insurance commissioners' financial standards and accreditation program must be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.

   d. If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely in lieu of revocation.

4. The commissioner must assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner by rule. The commissioner must publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.

5. A certified reinsurer must secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this section at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in rules adopted by the commissioner.

   a. In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer must maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of RCW 48.12.460, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with RCW 48.12.425, except as otherwise provided in this section.

   b. If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations under RCW 48.12.425, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer must maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this section or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations under RCW 48.12.425. It is a condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer must have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any trust account, out of the remaining surplus of the trust any deficiency of any other trust account.

   c. The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in RCW 48.12.425 are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this section, except that the trust must maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars.

   d. With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this section, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner must reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and has the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.

   e. For purposes of this section, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason must be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent of its obligations.

      i. As used in this section, "terminated" means revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.

      ii. If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by this section, this subsection (5)(e) does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.

6. If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a national association of insurance commissioners accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification, and has the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and the assuming insurer must be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.

7. A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer must continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this section, and the commissioner must assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.

\[ [2021 c 138 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5048.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20138%20§%203); [2015 c 63 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1077.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%2063%20§%208); \]

## 48.12.440 - Assuming insurer not licensed, accredited, or certified—No credit—Exceptions.
If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited, or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit permitted by RCW 48.12.420 and 48.12.425 must not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements:

1. [Empty]

   a. That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, must submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and

   b. To designate the commissioner or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer.

2. This section is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if this obligation is created in the agreement.

\[ [2015 c 63 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1077.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%2063%20§%209); \]

## 48.12.445 - Assuming insurer does not meet certain requirements—Trust agreements—Necessary conditions.
If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of RCW 48.12.410, 48.12.415, or 48.12.420, the credit permitted by RCW 48.12.425, 48.12.462, or 48.12.430 must not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:

1. Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount less than the amount required by RCW 48.12.425(3), or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation, or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee must comply with an order of the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund.

2. The assets must be distributed by and claims must be filed with and valued by the commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

3. If the commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part thereof are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part thereof must be returned by the commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in accordance with the trust agreement.

4. The grantor must waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law that is inconsistent with this provision.

\[ [2021 c 138 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5048.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%20138%20§%204); [2015 c 63 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1077.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%2063%20§%2010); \]

## 48.12.450 - Accredited or certified reinsurer does not meet requirements—Commissioner may suspend or revoke.
If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification.

1. The commissioner must give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hearing. The suspension or revocation may not take effect until after the commissioner's order on hearing, unless:

   a. The reinsurer waives its right to hearing;

   b. The commissioner's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under RCW 48.12.430(6); or

   c. The commissioner finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.

2. While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with RCW 48.12.460. If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with RCW 48.12.430(5) or 48.12.460.

## 48.12.455 - Ceding insurer—Reinsurance program.
1. A ceding insurer must take steps to manage its reinsurance recoverable proportionate to its own book of business. A domestic ceding insurer must notify the commissioner within thirty days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, exceeds fifty percent of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders, or after it is determined that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit. The notification must demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.

2. A ceding insurer must take steps to diversify its reinsurance program. A domestic ceding insurer must notify the commissioner within thirty days after ceding to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, more than twenty percent of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in the prior calendar year, or after it has determined that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit.

## 48.12.460 - Reinsurance ceded by domestic insurer to assuming insurer not meeting requirements—When asset or reduction from liability allowed.
An asset or a reduction from liability for the reinsurance ceded by a domestic insurer to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of RCW 48.12.405 through 48.12.455 must be allowed in an amount not exceeding the liabilities carried by the ceding insurer. The reduction must be in the amount of funds held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer, including funds held in trust for the ceding insurer, under a reinsurance contract with the assuming insurer as security for the payment of obligations thereunder, if the security is held in the United States subject to withdrawal solely by, and under the exclusive control of, the ceding insurer; or, in the case of a trust, held in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in RCW 48.12.465(2). This security may be in the form of:

   b. Letters of credit meeting applicable standards of issuer acceptability as of the dates of their issuance (or confirmation) must, notwithstanding the issuing (or confirming) institution's subsequent failure to meet applicable standards of issuer acceptability, continue to be acceptable as security until their expiration, extension, renewal, modification, or amendment, whichever first occurs; or

4. Any other form of security acceptable to the commissioner.

## 48.12.462 - Reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer—Reciprocal jurisdictions—Commissioner's duties.
1. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that:

   a. Is located and licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction;

   b. Has and maintains, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be set forth in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be set forth in rule;

   c. Has and maintains, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, to be established in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and is also licensed;

   d. Provides adequate assurance to the commissioner, in a form specified by the commissioner in rule, as follows:

      i. The assuming insurer must provide prompt written notice and explanation to the commissioner if it falls below the minimum requirements set forth in (b) or (c) of this subsection, or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law;

      ii. The assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the commissioner as agent for service of process. The commissioner may require that consent for service of process be provided to the commissioner and included in each reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this provision limits, or in any way alters, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws;

      iv. Each reinsurance agreement must include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded under that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate; and

      v. The assuming insurer must confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement which involves this state's ceding insurers, and agree to notify the ceding insurer and the commissioner and to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. This security must be in a form consistent with RCW 48.12.430 and 48.12.460 and as specified by the commissioner in rule;

3. The commissioner must create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions.

   a. The commissioner's list must include any reciprocal jurisdiction as defined in subsection (9)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, and consider any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published through the national association of insurance commissioners' committee process. The commissioner may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the national association of insurance commissioners' list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with the commissioner's rules.

   b. The commissioner may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with the commissioner's rules, except that the commissioner shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction as defined under subsection (9)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section. Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from this list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that is located in that jurisdiction shall be allowed if otherwise allowed under this chapter.

4. The commissioner must create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in this section and to which cessions shall be granted credit.

5. If the commissioner determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this subsection, the commissioner may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the assuming insurer for recognition under this subsection in accordance with procedures adopted in rule.

   b. If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into before the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of RCW 48.12.460.

6. If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.

7. This subsection does not limit or alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this chapter.

8. [Empty]
