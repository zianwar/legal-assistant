## 48.180.005 - Intent—Liberal construction.
This chapter is intended to provide authority for two or more nonprofit corporations to participate in a joint self-insurance program covering property or liability risks. This chapter provides nonprofit corporations with the authority to jointly self-insure property and liability risks, jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance, and contract for risk management, claims, and administrative services with other nonprofit corporations. This chapter must be liberally construed to grant nonprofit corporations maximum flexibility in jointly self-insuring to the extent the self-insurance programs are operated in a safe and sound manner. This chapter is intended to require prior approval for the establishment of every joint self-insurance program. In addition, this chapter is intended to require every joint self-insurance program for nonprofit corporations established under this chapter to notify the state of the existence of the program and to comply with the regulatory and statutory standards governing the management and operation of the programs as provided in this chapter. This chapter is not intended to authorize or regulate self-insurance of unemployment compensation under chapter 50.44 RCW or industrial insurance under chapter 51.14 RCW.

Nonprofit corporations may contract for or hire personnel to provide risk management, claims, and administrative services in accordance with this chapter.

2. The agreement to form a joint self-insurance program may include the organization of a separate legal or administrative entity with powers delegated to the entity. The entity may include or create a nonprofit corporation as defined in RCW 48.62.021.

A copy of the process, by registered mail with return receipt requested, must be sent by the state risk manager to the person designated to receive legal process by the joint self-insurance program in its most recent designation filed with the state risk manager. Proceedings may not commence against the joint self-insurance program, and the program is not required to appear, plead, or answer, until the expiration of forty days after the date of service upon the state risk manager.

   e. For any legal process issued against the program for causes of action arising outside of this state, the program shall provide the state risk manager a copy of such claim.

5. A nonprofit joint self-insurance program previously established under chapter 48.62 RCW may continue its operations without interruption. All previously approved operating documents under chapter 48.62 RCW including, but not limited to, applications, state-granted authorities, approvals to operate, certificates of incorporation, articles of incorporation, membership documents, executed contracts, and other applicable items or authorities remain in effect without reapproval.

6. A nonprofit joint self-insurance program previously established under and governed by chapter 48.62 RCW is not required to reapply for authority to operate as previously approved by the state risk manager in its original application.
