      iv. The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1982, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this section.

   b. The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent:

      i. For life insurance:

I = .03 + W (R1 - .03) + W/2 (R2 - .09);

      ii. For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:

I = .03 + W (R - .03)

R2 is the greater of R and .09,

R is the reference interest rate defined in this section, and

W is the weighting factor defined in this section;

   c. However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1983 using the reference interest rate defined for 1982 and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when RCW 48.76.050(7) becomes operative.

           D.  For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of twenty years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.

           E.  Plan type as used in the tables in (d)(iii)(A), (B), and (C) of this subsection is defined as follows:

Plan Type A: At any time a policyholder may withdraw funds only: (1) With an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more; or (3) as an immediate life annuity; or (4) no withdrawal permitted.

Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, a policyholder may withdraw funds only: (1) With adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more; or (3) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of the interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years.

Plan Type C: A policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of the interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either: (1) Without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; or (2) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.

           F.  A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this section, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract. The change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.

   e. The reference interest rate referred to in (b) and (c) of this subsection is defined as follows:

      i. For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30th of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

      ii. For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30th of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

      iii. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in (e)(ii) of this subsection, with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30th of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

      iv. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in (e)(ii) of this subsection, with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30th of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

      v. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30th of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

      vi. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in (e)(ii) of this subsection, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30th of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

   f. If the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or if the national association of insurance commissioners determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners and approved by rule adopted by the commissioner, may be substituted.

## 48.74.040 - Amount of reserves required.
1. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 48.74.040(2), 48.74.070, and 48.74.090, reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of such future guaranteed benefits provided for by such policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of (a) over (b), as follows:

   a. A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due: PROVIDED HOWEVER, That such net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy.

   b. A net one year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first policy year: PROVIDED, That for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined herein as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in RCW 48.74.070, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph of this subsection and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with: (i) The value defined in subparagraph (a) of that paragraph being reduced by fifteen percent of the amount of such excess first year premium; (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date; (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment; and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in RCW 48.74.030 (1) and (3) shall be used.

Reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method for life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums, group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended, disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts, and all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of the preceding paragraphs of this subsection.

2. This section shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended.

Reserves according to the commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.

## 48.74.050 - Minimum aggregate reserves.
1. In no event may a company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued on or after July 10, 1982, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in RCW 48.74.040, 48.74.070, and 48.74.080 and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for such policies.

2. In no event may the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required under RCW 48.74.025 and 48.74.028.

\[ [2016 c 142 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5180.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20142%20§%209); [1993 c 462 § 88](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1855-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20462%20§%2088); [1982 1st ex.s. c 9 § 5](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c9.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%209%20§%205); \]

## 48.74.060 - Other methods of reserve calculation.
1. Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to July 10, 1982, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to such date.

2. Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the commissioner, issued on or after July 10, 1982, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided in the policies or contracts.

3. A company which adopts at any time any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard under this chapter may , adopt a lower standard of valuation with the approval of the commissioner, but not lower than the minimum provided. For the purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required under RCW 48.74.025 and 48.74.028 is not to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.

\[ [2016 c 142 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5180.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20142%20§%2010); [1993 c 462 § 89](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1855-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20462%20§%2089); [1982 1st ex.s. c 9 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c9.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%209%20§%206); \]

## 48.74.070 - Minimum reserve if gross premium less than valuation net premium.
If in any contract year the gross premium charged by a company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for such policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this section are those standards stated in RCW 48.74.030 (1) and (3): PROVIDED, That for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this section shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in RCW 48.74.040, ignoring the second paragraph of that section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with RCW 48.74.040, including the second paragraph of that section, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this section.

\[ [2016 c 142 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5180.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20142%20§%2011); [1982 1st ex.s. c 9 § 7](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c9.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%209%20§%207); \]

## 48.74.080 - Procedure when specified methods of reserve determination unfeasible.
In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in RCW 48.74.040 and 48.74.070, the reserves which are held under any such plan must, under regulations promulgated by the commissioner:

1. Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and

2. Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this standard valuation law.

\[ [1982 1st ex.s. c 9 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1982ex1c9.pdf?cite=1982%201st%20ex.s.%20c%209%20§%208); \]

## 48.74.090 - Valuation of disability insurance.
For disability insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under RCW 48.74.022. For disability insurance contracts issued on or after July 10, 1982, and prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the minimum standard of valuation is the standard adopted by the commissioner by rule.

\[ [2016 c 142 § 12](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5180.SL.pdf?cite=2016%20c%20142%20§%2012); [1993 c 462 § 90](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1855-S.SL.pdf?cite=1993%20c%20462%20§%2090); \]

   a. Quantify the benefits and guarantees, and the funding, associated with the contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the lifetime of the contracts. For policies or contracts with significant tail risk, valuations must reflect conditions appropriately adverse to quantify the tail risk.

      i. The assumption is prescribed in the valuation manual.

      ii. For assumptions that are not prescribed, the assumptions must:

          A.  Be established utilizing the company's available experience, to the extent it is relevant and statistically credible; or

          B.  To the extent that company data is not available, relevant, or statistically credible, be established utilizing other relevant, statistically credible experience.

The certification must be based on the controls in place as of the end of the preceding calendar year.

   c. Develop, and file with the commissioner upon request, a principle-based valuation report that complies with standards prescribed in the valuation manual.

3. A principle-based valuation may include a prescribed formulaic reserve component.
