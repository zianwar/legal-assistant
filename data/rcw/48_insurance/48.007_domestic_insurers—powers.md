## 48.07.210 - Conversion to domestic insurer.
1. [Empty]

   a. Any insurer duly organized under the laws of any other state and admitted to transact insurance business in this state may become a domestic insurer upon complying with all requirements of law for the organization of a domestic insurer in this state and by designating its principal place of business at a location in this state. Such domestic insurer is entitled to a certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state, subject to the conditions set forth in (b) of this subsection, and is subject to the authority and the jurisdiction of this state.

   b. Before being eligible to become a domestic insurer under this section, an admitted insurer shall advise the commissioner, in writing, thirty days in advance of the proposed date of its plan to become a domestic insurer. The commissioner must approve the plan in advance of the proposed date. The commissioner shall not approve any such plan unless, after a hearing, pursuant to such notice as the commissioner may require, the commissioner finds that the plan is consistent with law, and that no reasonable objection to the plan exists. If the commissioner fails to approve the plan, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons for failure to approve the plan in an order issued at the hearing.

2. After providing thirty days' advance written notice of its plan to the commissioner and upon the written approval of the commissioner in advance of the proposed transfer date, any domestic insurer of this state may transfer its domicile to any other state in which it is admitted to transact the business of insurance. Upon transfer of domicile, the insurer ceases to be a domestic insurer of this state. If otherwise qualified under the laws of this state, the commissioner shall admit the insurer to do business in this state as a foreign insurer. The commissioner shall approve any proposed transfer of domicile unless the commissioner determines after a hearing, pursuant to such notice as the commissioner may require, that the transfer is not in the best interests of the public or the insurer's policyholders in this state. If the commissioner fails to approve a proposed transfer of domicile, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons for failure to approve the transfer in an order issued at the hearing.

3. When a foreign insurer, admitted to transact business in this state, transfers its corporate domicile to this state or to any other state, the certificate of authority, appointment of statutory agent, and all approved licenses, policy forms, rates, filings, and other authorizations and approvals in existence at the time the foreign insurer transfers its corporate domicile shall continue in effect.

4. Any insurer transferring its corporate domicile under this section shall file any amendments to articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other corporate documents that are required to be filed in this state before the insurer may receive approval of its proposed plan by the commissioner.
