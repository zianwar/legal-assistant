## 48.18.030 - Insurable interest—Personal insurances—Nonprofit organizations—Rules.
1. Any individual of competent legal capacity may insure his or her own life or body for the benefit of any person. A person may not insure the life or body of another individual unless the benefits under the contract are payable to the individual insured or the individual's personal representative, or to a person having, at the time when the contract was made, an insurable interest in the individual insured.

2. If the beneficiary, assignee or other payee under any contract made in violation of this section receives from the insurer any benefits accruing upon the death, disability, or injury of the individual insured, the individual insured or the individual's executor or administrator may maintain an action to recover any benefits from the person receiving them.

3. [Empty]

   a. "Insurable interest" as used in this section and in RCW 48.18.060 includes only the following interests:

      i. In the case of individuals related closely by blood or by law, a substantial interest engendered by love and affection; and

      ii. In the case of other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life, health, or bodily safety of the individual insured continue, as distinguished from an interest that would arise only by, or would be enhanced in value by, the death, disability, or injury of the individual insured.

   b. An individual who is party to a contract or option for the purchase or sale of an interest in a business partnership or firm, or of shares of stock of a close corporation or of an interest in those shares, has an insurable interest in the life of each individual party to the contract and for the purposes of that contract only, in addition to any insurable interest that may otherwise exist as to the life of such individual.

   c. A guardian, trustee, or other fiduciary has an insurable interest in the life of any person for whose benefit the fiduciary holds property, and in the life of any other individual in whose life the person has an insurable interest.

   d. Subject to rules adopted under subsection (4) of this section, upon joint application with a nonprofit organization for, or transfer to a nonprofit organization of, an insurance policy on the life of a person naming the organization as owner and beneficiary, a nonprofit organization's interest in the life of a person if:

      i. The nonprofit organization was established exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or to promote amateur athletic competition, to conduct testing for public safety, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals; and

      ii. The nonprofit organization:

          A.  Has existed for a minimum of five years; or

          B.  Has been issued a certificate of exemption to conduct a charitable gift annuity business under RCW 48.38.010, or is authorized to conduct a charitable gift annuity business under RCW 28B.10.485; or

          C.  Has been organized, and at all times has been operated, exclusively for benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more nonprofit organizations described in (d)(ii)(A) or (B) of this subsection and is operated, supervised, or controlled by or in connection with one or more of those nonprofit organizations; and

      iii. For a joint application, the person is not an employee, officer, or director of the organization who receives significant compensation from the organization and who became affiliated with the organization in that capacity less than one year before the joint application.

4. The commissioner may adopt rules governing joint applications for, and transfers of, life insurance under subsection (3)(d) of this section. The rules may include:

   a. Standards for full and fair disclosure that set forth the manner, content, and required disclosure for the sale of life insurance issued under subsection (3)(d) of this section; and

   b. For joint applications, a grace period of thirty days during which the insured person may direct the nonprofit organization to return the policy and the insurer to refund any premium paid to the party that, directly or indirectly, paid the premium; and

   c. Standards for granting an exemption from the five-year existence requirement of subsection (3)(d)(ii)(A) of this section to a private foundation that files with the insurance commissioner documents, stipulations, and information as the insurance commissioner may require to carry out the purpose of subsection (3)(d) of this section.

5. Nothing in this section permits the personal representative of the insured's estate to recover the proceeds of a policy on the life of a deceased insured person that was applied for jointly by, or transferred to, an organization covered by subsection (3)(d) of this section, where the organization was named owner and beneficiary of the policy.

This subsection applies to all life insurance policies applied for by, or transferred to, an organization covered by subsection (3)(d) of this section, regardless of the time of application or transfer and regardless of whether the organization would have been covered at the time of application or transfer.

## 48.18.070 - Alteration of application.
1. Any application for insurance in writing by the applicant shall be altered solely by the applicant or by his or her written consent, except that insertions may be made by the insurer for administrative purposes only in such manner as to indicate clearly that such insertions are not to be ascribed to the applicant. Violation of this provision shall be a misdemeanor.

2. Any insurer issuing an insurance contract upon such an application unlawfully altered by its officer, employee, or agent shall not have available in any action arising out of such contract, any defense which is based upon the fact of such alteration, or as to any item in the application which was so altered.

\[ [2009 c 549 § 7066](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5038.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20549%20§%207066); 1947 c 79 § .18.07; Rem. Supp. 1947 § 45.18.07; \]

2. If any policy of life or disability insurance delivered in this state is reinstated or renewed, and the insured or the beneficiary or assignee of the policy makes written request to the insurer for a copy of the application, if any, for such reinstatement or renewal, the insurer shall, within fifteen days after receipt of such request at its home office or at any of its branch offices, deliver or mail to the person making such request, a copy of such application. If such copy is not so delivered or mailed, the insurer shall be precluded from introducing the application as evidence in any action or proceeding based upon or involving the policy or its reinstatement or renewal.

2. In any application for life or disability insurance made in writing by the insured, all statements therein made by the insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties. The falsity of any such statement shall not bar the right to recovery under the contract unless such false statement was made with actual intent to deceive or unless it materially affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer.

\[ [2009 c 549 § 7067](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5038.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20549%20§%207067); 1947 c 79 § .18.09; Rem. Supp. 1947 § 45.18.09; \]

## 48.18.100 - Forms of policies—Filing, certification, and approval—Exceptions.
1. No insurance policy form or application form where written application is required and is to be attached to the policy, or printed life or disability rider or endorsement form may be issued, delivered, or used unless it has been filed with and approved by the commissioner. This section does not apply to:

   a. Surety bond forms;

   b. Forms filed under RCW 48.18.103;

   c. Forms exempted from filing requirements by the commissioner under RCW 48.18.103;

   d. Manuscript policies, riders, or endorsements of unique character designed for and used with relation to insurance upon a particular subject;

   e. Contracts of insurance procured under the provisions of chapter 48.15 RCW; or

   f. Forms filed under the requirements of RCW 48.43.733.

2. Every such filing containing a certification, in a form approved by the commissioner, by either the chief executive officer of the insurer or by an actuary who is a member of the American academy of actuaries, attesting that the filing complies with Title 48 RCW and Title 284 of the Washington Administrative Code, may be used by the insurer immediately after filing with the commissioner. The commissioner may order an insurer to cease using a certified form upon the grounds set forth in RCW 48.18.110. This subsection does not apply to certain types of policy forms designated by the commissioner by rule.

3. Except as provided in RCW 48.18.103 and 48.43.733, every filing that does not contain a certification pursuant to subsection (2) of this section must be made not less than thirty days in advance of issuance, delivery, or use. At the expiration of the thirty days, the filed form shall be deemed approved unless prior thereto it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by order of the commissioner. The commissioner may extend by not more than an additional fifteen days the period within which he or she may affirmatively approve or disapprove any form, by giving notice of the extension before expiration of the initial thirty-day period. At the expiration of the period that has been extended, and in the absence of prior affirmative approval or disapproval, the form shall be deemed approved. The commissioner may withdraw any approval at any time for cause. By approval of any form for immediate use, the commissioner may waive any unexpired portion of the initial thirty-day waiting period.

## 48.18.103 - Forms of commercial property casualty policies—Legislative intent—Issuance prior to filing—Disapproval by commissioner—Definition.
1. It is the intent of the legislature to assist the purchasers of commercial property casualty insurance by allowing policies to be issued more expeditiously and provide a more competitive market for forms.

2. Commercial property casualty policies may be issued prior to filing the forms.

3. All commercial property casualty forms must be filed with the commissioner within thirty days after an insurer issues any policy using them. This subsection does not apply to:

   a. Types or classes of forms that the commissioner exempts from filing by rule; and

   b. Manuscript policies, riders, or endorsements of unique character designed for and used with relation to insurance upon a particular subject.

4. If, within thirty days after a commercial property casualty form has been filed, the commissioner finds that the form does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the commissioner shall disapprove the form and give notice to the insurer or rating organization that made the filing, specifying how the form fails to meet the requirements and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the form shall be deemed no longer effective. The commissioner may extend the time for review an additional fifteen days by giving notice to the insurer prior to the expiration of the original thirty-day period.

5. Upon a final determination of a disapproval of a policy form under subsection (4) of this section, the insurer must amend any previously issued disapproved form by endorsement to comply with the commissioner's disapproval.

6. For purposes of this section, "commercial property casualty" means insurance pertaining to a business, profession, occupation, nonprofit organization, or public entity for the lines of property and casualty insurance defined in RCW 48.11.040, 48.11.050, 48.11.060, or 48.11.070, but does not mean medical malpractice insurance or portable electronics insurance as defined in RCW 48.120.005.

7. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the disapproval shall not affect any contract made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the notice of disapproval.

8. Every member or subscriber to a rating organization must adhere to the form filings made on its behalf by the organization. An insurer may deviate from forms filed on its behalf by an organization only if the insurer files the forms with the commissioner in accordance with this chapter.

9. In the event a hearing is held on the actions of the commissioner under subsection (4) of this section, the burden of proof shall be on the commissioner.

## 48.18.110 - Grounds for disapproval.
1. The commissioner shall disapprove any such form of policy, application, rider, or endorsement, or withdraw any previous approval thereof, only:

   b. If it does not comply with any controlling filing theretofore made and approved; or

   c. If it contains or incorporates by reference any inconsistent, ambiguous or misleading clauses, or exceptions and conditions which unreasonably or deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the contract; or

   d. If it has any title, heading, or other indication of its provisions which is misleading; or

   e. If purchase of insurance thereunder is being solicited by deceptive advertising.

2. In addition to the grounds for disapproval of any such form as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the commissioner may disapprove any form of disability insurance policy if the benefits provided therein are unreasonable in relation to the premium charged. Rates, or any modification of rates effective on or after July 1, 2008, for individual health benefit plans may not be used until sixty days after they are filed with the commissioner.

All such forms heretofore approved by the commissioner and for use as of immediately prior to the effective date of this code, may continue to be so used until the further order of the commissioner made pursuant to this subsection or pursuant to any other provision of this code.

2. The commissioner may from time to time, after hearing, promulgate such rules and regulations as he or she deems necessary to establish reasonable minimum standard conditions and terminology for basic benefits to be provided by disability insurance contracts which are subject to chapters 48.20 and 48.21 RCW, for the purpose of expediting his or her approval of such contracts pursuant to this code. No such promulgation shall be inconsistent with standard provisions as required pursuant to RCW 48.18.130, nor contain requirements inconsistent with requirements relative to the same benefit provision as formulated or approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

## 48.18.130 - Standard provisions.
1. Insurance contracts shall contain such standard provisions as are required by the applicable chapters of this code pertaining to contracts of particular kinds of insurance. The commissioner may waive the required use of a particular standard provision in a particular insurance contract form if

   b. the contract is otherwise approved by him or her.

2. No insurance contract shall contain any provision inconsistent with or contradictory to any such standard provision used or required to be used, but the commissioner may, except as to the standard provisions of individual disability insurance contracts as required under chapter 48.20 RCW, approve any provision which is in his or her opinion more favorable to the insured than the standard provision or optional standard provision otherwise required. No endorsement, rider, or other documents attached to such contract shall vary, extend, or in any respect conflict with any such standard provision, or with any modification thereof so approved by the commissioner as being more favorable to the insured.

3. In lieu of the standard provisions required by this code for contracts for particular kinds of insurance, substantially similar standard provisions required by the law of a foreign or alien insurer's domicile may be used when approved by the commissioner.

However, if the policyholder is a vendor licensed as a specialty producer pursuant to RCW 48.120.010, the notice required by this subsection must be mailed or delivered by the vendor.

10. Any notice or correspondence with respect to a policy of portable electronics insurance required under this section or otherwise required by law must be in writing. Notice or correspondence may be sent either by mail or by electronic means. If the notice or correspondence is mailed, it must be sent to the vendor of portable electronics at the vendor's mailing address specified for that purpose and to its affected enrolled customers' last known mailing addresses on file with the insurer.

The insurer or vendor of portable electronics must maintain proof of mailing in a form authorized or accepted by the United States postal service or other commercial mail delivery service. If a notice or correspondence is sent by electronic means, it must be sent to the vendor of portable electronics at the vendor's electronic mail address specified for that purpose and to its affected enrolled customers' last known electronic mail address as provided by each enrolled customer to the insurer or vendor of portable electronics, as the case may be.

For purposes of this subsection, an enrolled customer's provision of an electronic mail address to the insurer, supervising person, or vendor of portable electronics means that the enrolled customer consents to receive notices and correspondence by electronic mail as long as a disclosure to that effect is provided to the consumer at the time the consumer provides an electronic mail address. The insurer or vendor of portable electronics, as the case may be, must maintain proof that the notice or correspondence was sent.

11. Notice or correspondence required by this section or otherwise required by law may be sent by the supervising person appointed by the insurer on behalf of an insurer or a vendor.
