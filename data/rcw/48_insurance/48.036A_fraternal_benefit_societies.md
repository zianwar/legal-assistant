Any person may be indemnified and reimbursed by any society for expenses reasonably incurred by, and liabilities imposed upon, the person in connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, or threat thereof, in which the person may be involved by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society or of any firm, corporation, or organization which the person served in any capacity at the request of the society. A person shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed (a) in relation to any matter in such action, suit, or proceeding as to which the person shall finally be adjudged to be or have been guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society; or (b) in relation to any matter in the action, suit, or proceeding, or threat thereof, which has been made the subject of a compromise settlement; unless in either case the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful. The determination whether the conduct of the person met the standard required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement in relation to any matter described in (a) or (b) of this subsection may only be made by the supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, as to the person shall not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement. The foregoing right of indemnification and reimbursement shall not be exclusive of other rights to which the person may be entitled as a matter of law and shall inure to the benefit of the person's heirs, executors, and administrators.

3. A society may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee, or agent of any other firm, corporation, or organization against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any capacity or arising out of the person's status as such, whether or not the society would have the power to indemnify the person against the liability under this section.

   b. The purposes for which it is being formed and the mode in which its corporate powers are to be exercised. The purposes shall not include more liberal powers than are granted by this chapter;

   c. The names and residences of the incorporators and the names, residences, and official titles of all the officers, trustees, directors, or other persons who are to have and exercise the general control of the management of the affairs and funds of the society for the first year or until the ensuing election at which all the officers shall be elected by the supreme governing body, which election shall be held not later than one year from the date of issuance of the permanent certificate of authority.

2. The articles of incorporation, duly certified copies of the society's bylaws and rules, copies of all proposed forms of certificates, applications therefor, and circulars to be issued by the society, and a bond conditioned upon the return to applicants of the advanced payments if the organization is not completed within one year shall be filed with the commissioner, who may require further information as the commissioner deems necessary. The bond with sureties approved by the commissioner shall be in an amount, not less than three hundred thousand dollars nor more than one million five hundred thousand dollars as required by the commissioner. All documents filed are to be in the English language. If the purposes of the society conform to the requirements of this chapter and all provisions of the law have been complied with, the commissioner shall so certify, retain, and file the articles of incorporation and furnish the incorporators a preliminary certificate of authority authorizing the society to solicit members as hereinafter provided.

3. No preliminary certificate of authority granted under the provisions of this section shall be valid after one year from its date or after a further period, not exceeding one year, as may be authorized by the commissioner upon cause shown, unless the five hundred applicants required by subsection (4) of this section have been secured and the organization has been completed under this chapter. The articles of incorporation and all other proceedings thereunder shall become null and void in one year from the date of the preliminary certificate of authority, or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society shall have completed its organization and received a certificate of authority to do business under this chapter.

4. Upon receipt of a preliminary certificate of authority from the commissioner, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates, and shall issue to each applicant a receipt for the amount collected. No society shall incur any liability other than for the return of the advance premium, nor issue any certificate, nor pay, allow, or offer or promise to pay or allow, any benefit to any person until:

   a. Actual bona fide applications for benefits have been secured on not less than five hundred applicants, and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society;

   b. At least ten subordinate lodges have been established into which the five hundred applicants have been admitted;

   c. There has been submitted to the commissioner, under oath of the president or secretary, or corresponding officer of the society, a list of the applicants, giving their names, addresses, date each was admitted, name and number of the subordinate lodge of which each applicant is a member, amount of benefits to be granted, and premiums therefor; and

   d. It has been shown to the commissioner, by sworn statement of the treasurer, or corresponding officer of the society, that at least five hundred applicants have each paid in cash at least one regular monthly premium and the total amount of collected premiums equals at least one hundred fifty thousand dollars. The advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization and if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one year, the premiums shall be returned to the applicants.

5. The commissioner may make such examination and require such further information as the commissioner deems advisable. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the society has complied with all the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner shall issue to the society a certificate of authority to that effect and that the society is authorized to transact business pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The certificate of authority shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of the society at the date of the certificate. The commissioner shall cause a record of the certificate of authority to be made. A certified copy of the record may be given in evidence with like effect as the original certificate of authority.

6. Any incorporated society authorized to transact business in this state at the time this chapter becomes effective shall not be required to reincorporate.

7. The commissioner may, by rule, require domestic fraternal societies to have and maintain a larger amount of surplus than the minimum amount of capital and surplus prescribed under RCW 48.05.340, based upon the type, volume, and nature of insurance business transacted, consistent with the principles of risk-based capital modified to recognize the special characteristics of fraternal benefit societies.

\[ [1996 c 236 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6289.SL.pdf?cite=1996%20c%20236%20§%201); [1987 c 366 § 10](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c366.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20366%20§%2010); \]

## 48.36A.110 - Amendment of society's laws.
1. A domestic society may amend its laws in accordance with the provisions thereof by action of its supreme governing body at any regular or special meeting thereof or, if its laws so provide, by referendum. The referendum may be held in accordance with the provisions of its laws by the vote of the voting members of the society, by the vote of delegates or representatives of voting members, or by the vote of local lodges. A society may provide for voting by mail. No amendment submitted for adoption by referendum shall be adopted unless, within six months from the date of submission, a majority of the members voting shall have signified their consent to the amendment by one of the specified methods.

2. No amendment to the laws of any domestic society shall take effect unless approved by the commissioner. The commissioner shall approve the amendment if the commissioner finds that it has been duly adopted and is not inconsistent with any requirement of the laws of this state or with the character, objects, and purposes of the society. Unless the commissioner disapproves any amendment within sixty days after the filing of same, the amendment shall be considered approved. The approval or disapproval by the commissioner shall be in writing and mailed to the secretary or corresponding officer of the society at its principal office. In case the commissioner disapproves the amendment, the reasons for the disapproval shall be stated in the written notice.

3. Within ninety days from the approval by the commissioner, all amendments, or a synopsis thereof, shall be furnished to all members of the society either by mail or by publication in full in the official publication of the society. The affidavit of any officer of the society or of anyone authorized by it to mail any amendments or synopsis thereof, stating facts which show that same have been duly addressed and mailed, shall be prima facie evidence that the amendments or synopsis thereof, have been furnished to the addressee.

4. Every foreign or alien society authorized to do business in this state shall file with the commissioner a certified copy of all amendments of, or additions to, its laws within ninety days after their enactment.

5. Printed copies of the laws as amended, certified by the secretary or corresponding officer of the society, shall be prima facie evidence of their legal adoption.

\[ [1987 c 366 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c366.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20366%20§%2011); \]

1. A domestic society may, by a reinsurance agreement, transfer any individual risk or risks in whole or in part to an insurer, other than another fraternal benefit society, having the power to make such reinsurance and authorized to do business in this state, or if not so authorized, one which is approved by the commissioner, but no domestic society may reinsure substantially all of its insurance in force without the written permission of the commissioner. It may take credit for the reserves on the transferred risks to the extent reinsured, but no credit shall be allowed as an admitted asset or as a deduction from liability, to a transferring society for reinsurance made, transferred, renewed, or otherwise becoming effective after January 1, 1988, unless the reinsurance is payable by the assuming insurer on the basis of the liability of the transferring society under the contract or contracts reinsured without diminution because of the insolvency of the transferring society.

2. Notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (1) of this section, a society may reinsure the risks of another society in a consolidation or merger approved by the commissioner under RCW 48.36A.140.

\[ [1987 c 366 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c366.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20366%20§%2013); \]

## 48.36A.140 - Consolidation and merger.

   a. A certified copy of the written contract containing in full the terms and conditions of the consolidation or merger;

   b. A sworn statement by the president and secretary or corresponding officers of each society showing their financial condition on a date fixed by the commissioner but not earlier than December 31st next preceding the date of the contract;

   c. A certificate of the officers, duly verified by their respective oaths, that the consolidation or merger has been approved by a two-thirds vote of the supreme governing body of each society, such vote being conducted at a regular or special meeting of each such body, or, if the society's laws so permit, by mail; and

   d. Evidence that at least sixty days prior to the action of the supreme governing body of each society, the text of the contract has been furnished to all members of each society either by mail or by publication in full in the official publication of each society.

2.

## 48.36A.290 - License required—Obtaining.
1. No foreign or alien society shall transact business in this state without a license issued by the commissioner. Any society desiring admission to this state shall comply substantially with the requirements and limitations of this chapter applicable to domestic societies and must have and continue to maintain unimpaired surplus in the minimum amount of total capital and surplus required by RCW 48.05.340. A society may be licensed to transact business in this state upon filing with the commissioner:

   a. A duly certified copy of its articles of incorporation;

   b. A copy of its bylaws, certified by its secretary or corresponding officer;

   c. A power of attorney to the commissioner as prescribed in RCW 48.36A.410;

   d. A statement of its business under oath by its president and secretary, or corresponding officers, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, verified by an examination made by the supervising insurance official of its home state or other state, territory, province, or country, satisfactory to the commissioner;

   e. Certification from the proper official of its home state, territory, province, or country that the society is legally incorporated and licensed to transact business;

   f. Copies of its certificate forms; and

   g. Such other information as the commissioner may deem necessary; and upon a showing that its assets are invested in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

2. After June 30, 1997, a foreign or alien society which does not have unimpaired surplus in the minimum amount of total capital and surplus required by RCW 48.05.340 may not issue any new policies or certificates until the society has unimpaired surplus in the minimum amount of total capital and surplus required by RCW 48.05.340; however, a foreign or alien society may continue to issue new policies or certificates to members of the society who have an existing policy or certificate in force with the society on June 30, 1997. Once such a foreign or alien society obtains unimpaired surplus in the minimum amount of total capital and surplus required by RCW 48.05.340, the society must continue to maintain unimpaired surplus in the minimum amount of total capital and surplus required by RCW 48.05.340.

3. After June 30, 1997, a foreign or alien society which had unimpaired surplus in the minimum amount of total capital and surplus required by RCW 48.05.340 on December 31, 1996, must continue to maintain unimpaired surplus in the minimum amount of total capital and surplus required by RCW 48.05.340.

4. The commissioner may, by rule, require foreign or alien fraternal societies to have and maintain a larger amount of surplus than the minimum amount of capital and surplus prescribed under RCW 48.05.340, based upon the type, volume, and nature of insurance business transacted, consistent with the principles of risk-based capital modified to recognize the special characteristics of fraternal benefit societies.

   d. Is conducting its business fraudulently;

   j. Is found by the commissioner, after investigation or upon receipt of reliable information, to be managed by persons, whether by its trustees, directors, officers, or by any other means, who are incompetent or untrustworthy or so lacking in fraternal benefit society managerial experience as to make a proposed operation hazardous to its members; or that there is good reason to believe it is affiliated directly or indirectly through ownership, control, or business relations, with any person or persons whose business operations are or have been found to be in violation of any law or rule, to the detriment of the members of the society or of the public, by bad faith or by manipulation of the assets, or of accounts, or of reinsurance of the society; or

   k. Does business through insurance producers or other representatives in this state or in any other state who are not properly licensed under applicable laws and rules.
