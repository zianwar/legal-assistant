## 48.21A.010 - Declaration of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a means of more adequately meeting the needs of persons who are sixty-five years of age or older and their spouses for insurance coverage against financial loss from accident or disease through the combined resources and experience of a number of insurers; to make possible the fullest extension of such coverage by encouraging insurers to combine their resources and experience and to exercise their collective efforts in the development and offering of policies of such insurance to all applicants; and to regulate the joint activities herein authorized in accordance with the intent of Congress as expressed in the Act of Congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, 79th Congress), as amended.

\[ [1965 ex.s. c 70 § 27](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965ex1c70.pdf?cite=1965%20ex.s.%20c%2070%20§%2027); \]

## 48.21A.020 - Definitions.
Wherever used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings hereinafter set forth or indicated, unless the context otherwise requires:

a. "Association" means a voluntary unincorporated association of insurers formed for the purpose of enabling cooperative action to provide disability insurance in accordance with this chapter in this or any other state having legislation enabling the issuance of insurance of the type provided in this chapter.

   b. "Insurer" means any insurance company which is authorized to transact disability insurance in this state.

   c. "Extended health insurance" means hospital, surgical and medical expense insurance provided by a policy issued as provided by this chapter.

\[ [1965 ex.s. c 70 § 28](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965ex1c70.pdf?cite=1965%20ex.s.%20c%2070%20§%2028); \]

## 48.21A.030 - Insurers may join—Policyholder—Reduced benefit provision—Master group policy—Offering—Cancellation.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this code or any other law which may be inconsistent herewith, any insurer may join with one or more other insurers, to plan, develop, underwrite, and offer and provide to any person who is sixty-five years of age or older and to the spouse of such person, extended health insurance against financial loss from accident or disease, or both. Such insurance may be offered, issued and administered jointly by two or more insurers by a group policy issued to a policyholder through an association formed for the purpose of offering, selling, issuing and administering such insurance. The policyholder may be an association, a trustee, or any other person. Any such policy may provide, among other things, that the benefits payable thereunder are subject to reduction if the individual insured has any other coverage providing hospital, surgical or medical benefits whether on an indemnity basis or a provision of service basis resulting in such insured being eligible for more than one hundred percent of covered expenses which he or she is required to pay, and any insurer issuing individual policies providing extended hospital, surgical or medical benefits to persons sixty-five years of age and older and their spouses may also use such a policy provision. A master group policy issued to an association or to a trustee or any person appointed by an association for the purpose of providing the insurances described in this section shall be another form of group disability insurance.

Any form of policy approved by the commissioner for an association shall be offered throughout Washington to all persons sixty-five and older and their spouses, and the coverage of any person insured under such a form of policy shall not be cancellable except for nonpayment of premiums unless the coverage of all persons insured under such form of policy is also canceled.

## 48.21A.040 - Insurance producers.
 Any person licensed to transact disability insurance as an insurance producer may transact extended health insurance and may be paid a commission thereon.

\[ [2008 c 217 § 25](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6591.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20217%20§%2025); [1965 ex.s. c 70 § 30](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965ex1c70.pdf?cite=1965%20ex.s.%20c%2070%20§%2030); \]

## 48.21A.050 - Powers and duties of associations.
Any association formed for the purposes of this chapter may hold title to property, may enter into contracts, and may limit the liability of its members to their respective pro rata shares of the liability of such association. Any such association may sue and be sued in its associate name and for such purpose only shall be treated as a domestic corporation. Service of process against such association, made upon a managing agent, any member thereof or any agent authorized by appointment to receive service of process, shall have the same force and effect as if such service had been made upon all members of the association. Such association's books and records shall also be subject to examination under the provisions of RCW 48.03.010 through 48.03.070, inclusive, either separately or concurrently with examination of any of its member insurers.

\[ [1983 c 3 § 151](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c3.pdf?cite=1983%20c%203%20§%20151); [1965 ex.s. c 70 § 31](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965ex1c70.pdf?cite=1965%20ex.s.%20c%2070%20§%2031); \]

## 48.21A.060 - Commissioner's powers—Forms—Rates—Standard provisions—Withdrawal of approval—Federal, state benefits—Annual reports.
The forms of the policies, applications, certificates or other evidence of insurance coverage and applicable premium rates relating thereto shall be filed with the commissioner. No such policy, contract, or other evidence of insurance, application or other form shall be sold, issued or used and no endorsement shall be attached to or printed or stamped thereon unless the form thereof shall have been approved by the commissioner or thirty days shall have expired after such filing without written notice from the commissioner of disapproval thereof. The commissioner shall disapprove the forms of such insurance if he or she finds that they are unjust, unfair, inequitable, misleading or deceptive or that the rates are by reasonable assumption excessive in relation to the benefits provided. In determining whether such rates by reasonable assumptions are excessive in relation to the benefits provided, the commissioner shall give due consideration to past and prospective claim experience, within and outside this state, and to fluctuations in such claim experience, to a reasonable risk charge, to contribution to surplus and contingency funds, to past and prospective expenses, both within and outside this state, and to all other relevant factors within and outside this state including any differing operating methods of the insurers joining in the issue of the policy. In exercising the powers conferred upon him or her by this chapter, the commissioner shall not be bound by any other requirement of this code with respect to standard provisions to be included in disability policies or forms.

The commissioner may, after hearing upon written notice, withdraw an approval previously given, upon such grounds as in his or her opinion would authorize disapproval upon original submission thereof. Any such withdrawal of approval after hearing shall be by notice in writing specifying the ground thereof and shall be effective at the expiration of such period, not less than ninety days after the giving of notice of withdrawal, as the commissioner shall in such notice prescribe.

If and when a program of hospital, surgical and medical benefits is enacted by the federal government or the state of Washington, the extended health insurance benefits provided by policies issued under this chapter shall be adjusted to avoid any duplication of benefits offered by the federal or state programs and the premium rates applicable thereto shall be adjusted to conform with the adjusted benefits.

The association shall submit an annual report to the insurance commissioner which shall become public information and shall provide information as to the number of persons insured, the names of the insurers participating in the association with respect to insurance offered under this chapter and the calendar year experience applicable to such insurance offered under this chapter, including premiums earned, claims paid during the calendar year, the amount of claims reserve established, administrative expenses, commissions, promotional expenses, taxes, contingency reserve, other expenses, and profit and loss for the year. The commissioner shall require the association to provide any and all information concerning the operations of the association deemed relevant by him for inclusion in the report.

\[ [2009 c 549 § 7105](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5038.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20549%20§%207105); [1965 ex.s. c 70 § 32](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965ex1c70.pdf?cite=1965%20ex.s.%20c%2070%20§%2032); \]

## 48.21A.070 - Documents to be filed—Deceptive name or advertising.
The articles of association of any association formed in accordance with this chapter, all amendments and supplements thereto, a designation in writing of a resident of this state as agent for the service of process, and a list of insurers who are members of the association and all supplements thereto shall be filed with the commissioner.

The name of any association or any advertising or promotional material used in connection with extended health insurance to be sold, offered, or issued, pursuant to this chapter shall not be such as to mislead or deceive the public.

## 48.21A.080 - Remedies.
No act done, action taken or agreement made pursuant to the authority conferred by this chapter shall constitute a violation of or grounds for prosecution or civil proceedings under any other law of this state heretofore or hereafter enacted which does not specifically refer to insurance.

\[ [1965 ex.s. c 70 § 34](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1965ex1c70.pdf?cite=1965%20ex.s.%20c%2070%20§%2034); \]

## 48.21A.090 - Home health care, hospice care, optional coverage required—Standards, limitations, restrictions—Rules—Medicare supplemental contracts excluded.
1. Every insurer entering into or renewing extended health insurance governed by this chapter shall offer optional coverage for home health care and hospice care for persons who are homebound and would otherwise require hospitalization. Such optional coverage need only be offered in conjunction with a policy that provides payment for hospitalization as a part of health care coverage. Persons seeking such services for palliative care in conjunction with treatment or management of serious or life-threatening illness need not be homebound in order to be eligible for coverage under this section.

2. Home health care and hospice care coverage offered under subsection (1) of this section shall conform to the following standards, limitations, and restrictions in addition to those set forth in chapters 70.126 and 70.127 RCW:

   a. The coverage may include reasonable deductibles, coinsurance provisions, and internal maximums;

   b. The coverage should be structured to create incentives for the use of home health care and hospice care as an alternative to hospitalization;

   c. The coverage may contain provisions for utilization review and quality assurance;

   d. The coverage may require that home health agencies and hospices have written treatment plans approved by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW, and may require such treatment plans to be reviewed at designated intervals;

   e. The coverage shall provide benefits for, and restrict benefits to, services rendered by home health and hospice agencies licensed under chapter 70.127 RCW;

   f. Hospice care coverage shall provide benefits for terminally ill patients for an initial period of care of not less than six months and may provide benefits for an additional six months of care in cases where the patient is facing imminent death or is entering remission if certified in writing by the attending physician;

   g. Home health care coverage shall provide benefits for a minimum of one hundred thirty health care visits per calendar year. However, a visit of any duration by an employee of a home health agency for the purpose of providing services under the plan of treatment constitutes one visit;

   h. The coverage may be structured so that services or supplies included in the primary contract are not duplicated in the optional home health and hospice coverage.

3. The insurance commissioner shall adopt any rules necessary to implement this section.

4. The requirements of this section shall not apply to contracts or policies governed by chapter 48.66 RCW.

5. An insurer, as a condition of reimbursement, may require compliance with home health and hospice certification regulations established by the United States department of health and human services.

For the purposes of this chapter, the terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband, wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family shall be interpreted as applying equally to state registered domestic partnerships or individuals in state registered domestic partnerships as well as to marital relationships and married persons, and references to dissolution of marriage shall apply equally to state registered domestic partnerships that have been terminated, dissolved, or invalidated, to the extent that such interpretation does not conflict with federal law. Where necessary to implement chapter 521, Laws of 2009, gender-specific terms such as husband and wife used in any statute, rule, or other law shall be construed to be gender neutral, and applicable to individuals in state registered domestic partnerships.
