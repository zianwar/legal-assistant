## 48.17.010 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this title unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Adjuster" means any person who either investigates and negotiates settlement relative to insurance claims, or applies the factual circumstances of an insurance claim to the insurance policy provisions, or both, arising under property and casualty insurance contracts. An attorney-at-law who adjusts insurance losses from time to time incidental to the practice of his or her profession or an adjuster of marine losses is not deemed to be an "adjuster" for the purpose of this chapter. A salaried employee of an insurer or of a managing general agent is not deemed to be an "adjuster" for the purpose of this chapter, except when acting as a crop adjuster. An appraiser or umpire functioning under the appraisal clause in an insurance contract is not deemed to be an "adjuster" for the purpose of this chapter.

   a. "Independent adjuster" means an adjuster representing the interests of the insurer.

   b. "Public adjuster" means an adjuster employed by and representing solely the financial interests of the insured named in the policy.

   c. "Crop adjuster" means an adjuster, including (i) an independent adjuster, (ii) a public adjuster, and (iii) an employee of an insurer or managing general agent, who acts as an adjuster for claims arising under crop insurance. A salaried employee of an insurer or of a managing general agent who is certified by a crop adjuster program approved by the risk management agency of the United States department of agriculture is not a "crop adjuster" for the purposes of this chapter. Proof of certification must be provided to the commissioner upon request.

   d. For the purposes of this chapter:

      i. "Appraiser" means a person selected by the insurer or the insured to place a value on or estimate the amount of loss under an appraisal clause in an insurance contract.

4. "Home state" means the District of Columbia and any state or territory of the United States or province of Canada in which an insurance producer or adjuster maintains the insurance producer's or adjuster's principal place of residence or principal place of business, and is licensed to act as an insurance producer or adjuster.

"Insurance education provider" means any insurer, health care service contractor, health maintenance organization, professional association, educational institution created by Washington statutes, or vocational school licensed under Title 28C RCW, or independent contractor to which the commissioner has granted authority to conduct and certify completion of a course satisfying the insurance education requirements of RCW 48.17.150.

6. "Insurance producer" means a person required to be licensed under the laws of this state to sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance. "Insurance producer" does not include title insurance agents as defined in subsection (16) of this section or surplus line brokers licensed under chapter 48.15 RCW.

7. "Insurer" has the same meaning as in RCW 48.01.050, and includes a health care service contractor as defined in RCW 48.44.010 and a health maintenance organization as defined in RCW 48.46.020.

8. "License" means a document issued by the commissioner authorizing a person to act as an insurance producer or title insurance agent for the lines of authority specified in the document. The license itself does not create any authority, actual, apparent, or inherent, in the holder to represent or commit to an insurer.

9. "Limited line credit insurance" includes credit life, credit disability, credit property, credit unemployment, involuntary unemployment, mortgage life, mortgage guaranty, mortgage disability, automobile dealer gap insurance, and any other form of insurance offered in connection with an extension of credit that is limited to partially or wholly extinguishing the credit obligation that the commissioner determines should be designated a form of limited line credit insurance.

11. "Negotiate" means the act of conferring directly with, or offering advice directly to, a purchaser or prospective purchaser of a particular contract of insurance concerning any of the substantive benefits, terms, or conditions of the contract, provided that the person engaged in that act either sells insurance or obtains insurance from insurers for purchasers.

12. "Person" means an individual or a business entity.

13. "Sell" means to exchange a contract of insurance by any means, for money or its equivalent, on behalf of an insurer.

14. "Solicit" means attempting to sell insurance or asking or urging a person to apply for a particular kind of insurance from a particular insurer.

15. "Terminate" means the cancellation of the relationship between an insurance producer and the insurer or the termination of an insurance producer's authority to transact insurance.

16. "Title insurance agent" means a business entity licensed under the laws of this state and appointed by an authorized title insurance company to sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance on behalf of the title insurance company.

17. "Uniform application" means the current version of the NAIC uniform application for individual insurance producers for resident and nonresident insurance producer licensing.

## 48.17.591 - Termination of agency contract—Effect on insured—Definition—Application of section.
1. No insurer authorized to do business in this state may cancel or refuse to renew any policy because that insurer's contract with the independent insurance producer through whom such policy is written has been terminated by the insurer, the insurance producer, or by mutual agreement.

2. If an insurer intends to terminate a written agency contract with an independent insurance producer, the insurer shall give the insurance producer not less than one hundred twenty days' advance written notice of the intent, unless the reason for termination is one of the reasons set forth in RCW 48.17.530. During the notice period the insurer shall not amend the existing contract without the consent of the insurance producer.

   a. Unless the agency contract provides otherwise, during the one hundred twenty day notice period the independent insurance producer shall not write or bind any new business on behalf of the terminating insurer without specific written approval. However, routine adjustments by insureds are permitted. The terminating insurer shall permit renewal of all its policies in the insurance producer's book of business for a period of one year following the effective date of the termination, to the extent the policies meet the insurer's underwriting standards and the insurer has no other reason for nonrenewal. The rate of commission for any policies renewed under this provision shall be the same as the insurance producer would have received had the agency agreement not been terminated.

   b. An independent insurance producer whose agency contract has been terminated shall have a reasonable opportunity to transfer affected policies to other insurers with which the insurance producer has an appointment: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That prior to the conclusion of the one-year renewal period following the effective date of the termination, an insurer without a reason for not renewing an insured's policy and which has not received notification of the placement of such policy with another insurer shall provide its insured with appropriate written notice of an offer to continue the policy. In such cases, except where the terminated insurance producer has placed the policy with another agent of the insurer, the insurer shall, where practical, assign the policy to an appointed insurance producer located reasonably near the insured willing to accept the assignment.

   c. An insurer is not required to continue the appointment of a terminated independent insurance producer during or after the one year renewal period. However, an insurance producer whose contract has been terminated by the insurer remains an agent of the terminating insurer as to actions associated with the policies subject to this section just as if the insurance producer were appointed by the insurer as its agent.

3. In the absence of receipt of notice from the insured that coverage will not be continued with the existing insurer, an insurer whose agency contract has been terminated by an independent insurance producer, or by the mutual agreement of the insurer and the insurance producer, that elects to renew or lacks a reason not to renew, shall give the renewal notice required by chapter 48.18 RCW to affected insureds, and continue renewed coverage in accordance with the methods specified in subsection (2)(b) of this section. Insurance producers affected by this subsection may provide the notice to an insurer that an insured does not intend to continue existing coverage with the insurer, after receiving written authority to do so from an insured.

4. For purposes of this section an "independent insurance producer" is a licensed insurance producer representing an insurer on an independent contractor basis and not as an employee. This term includes only those insurance producers not obligated by contract to place insurance accounts with a particular insurer or group of insurers.

5. This section does not apply to:

   a. Insurance producers or policies of an insurer or group of insurers if the business is not owned by the insurance producer and the termination of any such contractual agreement does not result in the cancellation or nonrenewal of any policies of insurance;

   b. Managing general agents, to the extent that they are acting in that capacity;

   c. Life, disability, surety, ocean marine and foreign trade, and title insurance policies;

   d. Situations where the termination of the agency contract results from the insolvency or liquidation of the terminating insurer.

6. No insurer may terminate its agency contract with an appointed insurance producer unless it complies with this section.

7. Nothing contained in this section excuses an insurer from giving cancellation and renewal notices that may be required by chapter 48.18 RCW.

Upon the written request of the commissioner, the insurer shall provide additional information, documents, records, or other data pertaining to the termination or activity of the insurance producer or title insurance agent.

2. An insurer or authorized representative of the insurer that terminates the appointment, employment, or contract with an insurance producer or title insurance agent for any reason not set forth in RCW 48.17.530, shall notify the commissioner within thirty days following the effective date of the termination, using a format prescribed by the commissioner. Upon written request of the commissioner, the insurer shall provide additional information, documents, records, or other data pertaining to the termination.

3. The insurer or the authorized representative of the insurer shall promptly notify the commissioner in a format acceptable to the commissioner if, upon further review or investigation, the insurer discovers additional information that would have been reportable to the commissioner in accordance with subsection (1) of this section had the insurer then known of its existence.

4. A copy of the notification to the commissioner shall be provided to the insurance producer or title insurance agent.

   a. Within fifteen days after making the notification required by subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section, the insurer shall mail a copy of the notification to the insurance producer or title insurance agent at the insurance producer's or title insurance agent's last known address.
