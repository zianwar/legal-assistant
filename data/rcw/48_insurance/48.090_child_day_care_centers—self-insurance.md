## 48.90.010 - Findings and intent.
1. Day care providers are facing a major crisis in that adequate and affordable business liability insurance is no longer available within this state for persons who care for children. Many child day care centers have been forced to purchase inadequate coverage at prohibitive premium rates from unregulated foreign surplus line carriers over which the state has minimal control.

2. There is a danger that a substantial number of child day care centers who cannot afford the escalating premiums will be unable or unwilling to remain in business without adequate coverage. As a result the number of available facilities will be drastically reduced forcing some parents to leave the workforce to care for their children. A corresponding demand upon the state's resources will result in the form of public assistance to unemployed parents and day care providers.

3. There is a further danger that a substantial number of child day care centers now licensed pursuant to state law, who currently provide specific safeguards for the health and safety of children but are unable to procure insurance, may choose to continue to operate without state approval, avoiding regulation and payment of legitimate taxes, and forcing some parents to place their children in facilities of unknown quality and questionable levels of safety.

4. Most child day care centers are small business enterprises with limited resources. The state's policies encourage the growth and development of small businesses.

5. [Empty]

   a. This chapter is intended to remedy the problem of nonexistent or unaffordable liability coverage for child day care centers, and to encourage compliance with state laws protecting children while meeting the state's sound economic policies of encouraging small business development, sustaining an active workforce, and discouraging policies that result in an increased drain on the state's resources through public assistance and other forms of public funding.

   b. This chapter will empower child day care centers to create self-insurance pools, to purchase insurance coverage, and to contract for risk management and administrative services through an association with demonstrated responsible fiscal management.

The intent of this legislation is to allow these associations maximum flexibility to create and administer plans to provide coverage and risk management services to licensed child day care centers.

\[ [1986 c 142 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c142.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20142%20§%2013); \]

## 48.90.140 - Dissolution of plan and association.
1. If at any time the plan can no longer be operated on a sound financial basis, the association may elect to dissolve the plan, subject to explicit approval by the commissioner of a plan for dissolution. Once a plan operated by an association has been dissolved, that association may not again implement a plan pursuant to this chapter for five calendar years.

2. At dissolution, the assets of the association represented by the contributing trust fund shall be deposited with the commissioner for a period of twenty-one years, to be made available for claims arising during that period based upon occurrences during the term of coverage. At the time of transfer of the funds, the association shall certify to the commissioner a list of all current subscribers, with their correct mailing addresses, and shall have notified all current subscribers of their obligation to keep the commissioner informed of any changes in their mailing addresses over the twenty-one year period, and that this obligation extends to their representatives, successors, assigns, and to the representatives of their estates. Upon dissolution, the association is required to provide to the commissioner a list of all plan subscribers during all of the years of operation of the plan.

At the end of the twenty-one year period, any funds remaining in the trust account must be distributed to those subscribers who were current subscribers in the most recent year of operation of the plan, with each current subscriber receiving an equal share of the distribution, without regard for the length of time each child day care center was a subscriber.

In the alternative, in the discretion of the association, the balance of the contributing trust fund may be used to purchase similar or more liberal coverage from a commercial insurer. Each subscriber shall, however, be given the option to deposit its share of the fund with the commissioner as provided in this section if it elects not to participate in the proposed commercial insurance.
