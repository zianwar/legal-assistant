   g. The provider has entered into any life settlement contract that has not been approved under this chapter;

   h. The provider has failed to honor contractual obligations set out in a life settlement contract;

   j. The provider or any officer, partner, member, or key management personnel has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or fails to comply with any proper order or regulation of the commissioner.

3. The commissioner shall give the provider notice of his or her intention to suspend, revoke, or not renew its license not less than ten days before the order of suspension, revocation, or nonrenewal is to become effective. The commissioner shall not suspend a provider's license for a period in excess of one year, and the commissioner shall state in the order of suspension the period during which it shall be effective.

4.

4. [Empty]

   a. Every examination, whatsoever, or any part of the examination of any person licensed or regulated under this chapter shall be at the expense of the person examined. RCW 48.03.060 (1) and (2) are not applicable to persons licensed or regulated under this chapter.

   e. The fact that the owner has a right to terminate a life settlement contract within fifteen days of the date it is executed by all parties and the owner has received the disclosures required by this section. Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given, and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the provider;

   f. The fact that proceeds will be sent to the owner within three business days after the provider has received the insurer or group administrator's acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated in accordance with the terms of the life settlement contract;

   g. The fact that entering into a life settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy to be forfeited by the owner and that assistance should be sought from a professional financial advisor;

If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every two years.";

   k. A separate signed fraud warning as follows:

"Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or life settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison.";

   l. The fact that the insured may be contacted by either the provider or broker or its authorized representative for the purpose of determining the insured's health status or to verify the insured's address. This contact is limited to once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, and no more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less;

   m. The affiliation, if any, between the provider and the issuer of the insurance policy to be settled;

   n. That a broker represents exclusively the owner, and not the insurer or the provider or any other person, and owes a fiduciary duty to the owner, including a duty to act according to the owner's instructions and in the best interest of the owner;

   o. The document shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the provider;

   p. The name, business address, and telephone number of the independent third-party escrow agent, and the fact that the owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents; and

   q. The fact that a change of ownership could in the future limit the insured's ability to purchase future insurance on the insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one life.

   c. A written disclosure of any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the broker and any person making an offer in connection with the proposed life settlement contracts;

   d. The name of each broker who receives compensation and the amount of compensation received by that broker, which compensation includes anything of value paid or given to the broker in connection with the life settlement contract;

   e. A complete reconciliation of the gross offer or bid by the provider to the net amount of proceeds or value to be received by the owner. For the purpose of this section, gross offer or bid means the total amount or value offered by the provider for the purchase of one or more life insurance policies, inclusive of commissions and fees; and

   f. The failure to provide the disclosures or rights described in this section is an unfair trade practice pursuant to RCW 48.102.180.

## 48.102.090 - Disclosure by insurer.
In addition to other questions an insurance carrier may lawfully pose to a life insurance applicant, insurance carriers may inquire in the application for insurance whether the proposed owner intends to pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a lender that will use the policy as collateral to support the financing.

1. If, as described in RCW 48.102.006, the loan provides funds which can be used for a purpose other than paying for the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the life insurance policy and loan, the application shall be rejected as a violation of the prohibited practices in RCW 48.102.130.

2. If the financing does not violate RCW 48.102.130 in this manner, the insurance carrier:

   a. May make disclosures, including but not limited to the applicant and the insured, either on the application or an amendment to the application to be completed no later than the delivery of the policy:

"If you have entered into a loan arrangement where the policy is used as collateral, and the policy does change ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the following may be true:

      i. A change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life;

      ii. A change of ownership could in the future limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one life;

      iii. Should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage on the insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status, and/or other factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage and/or may result in significantly higher premiums;

      iv. You should consult a professional advisor, since a change in ownership in satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on the structure of the loan"; and

   b. May require certifications, such as the following, from the applicant and/or the insured:

"(i) I have not entered into any agreement or arrangement providing for the future sale of this life insurance policy;

      ii. My loan arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to pay for some or all of the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining my life insurance policy, but I have not entered into any agreement by which I am to receive consideration in exchange for procuring this policy; and

      iii. The borrower has an insurable interest in the insured."

## 48.102.100 - Notice to insured of alternative transactions—Document approved by commissioner.
1. With respect to each policy issued by an insurance company, the insurance company shall notify the owner of an individual life insurance policy when the insured person under such a policy is age sixty or older, or is known to be terminally ill or chronically ill, that there may be alternative transactions available to that owner at the time of each of the following:

   a. When a life insurance company receives from such an owner a request to surrender, in whole or in part, an individual policy;

   b. When a life insurance company receives from such an owner a request to receive an accelerated death benefit under an individual policy;

   c. When a life insurance company sends to such an owner all notices of lapse of an individual policy; or

   d. At any other time that the commissioner may require by rule.

2. [Empty]

   a. The commissioner shall approve a document calculated to appraise the consumer of his or her rights as an owner of a life insurance policy. The document shall be made available at no cost to all insurance companies and life insurance producers and written in lay terms.

   b. The document shall advise the consumer:

      i. That life insurance is a critical part of a broader financial plan, and that the consumer is encouraged, and has a right, to seek additional financial advice and opinions;

      ii. That possible alternatives to lapse exist; and

      iii. Of the definitions of common industry terms.

   c. In addition to the information described in (a) and (b) of this subsection, the document must contain the following statement in large, bold, or otherwise conspicuous typeface calculated to draw the eye: "Life insurance is a critical part of a broader financial plan. There are many options available, and you have the right to shop around and seek advice from different financial advisers in order to find the option best suited to your needs."

   d. The document may include brief descriptions of common products available from providers. These products must be discussed in general terms for informative purposes only, and not identifiable to any specific provider.

   e. The document will be considered part of the notice required in subsection (1) of this section.

\[ [2009 c 104 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5195-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20104%20§%2013); \]

## 48.102.110 - General rules.
1. A provider entering into a life settlement contract with any owner of a policy, wherein the insured is terminally or chronically ill, shall first obtain:

   a. If the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a settlement contract; and

   b. A document in which the insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a provider, settlement broker, or insurance producer and, if the policy was issued less than two years from the date of application for a settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued the policy.

2. The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a provider, settlement broker, or life insurance producer not later than thirty calendar days of the date the request is received. The request for verification of coverage must be made on a form approved by the commissioner. The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond. In its response, the insurer shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract.

3. Before or at the time of execution of the settlement contract, the provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the settlement contract, that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the policy and acknowledges that the owner is entering into the settlement contract freely and voluntarily, and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued.

4. The insurer shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state or with a resident of this state.

5. If a settlement broker or life insurance producer performs any of these activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.

6. If a broker performs the verification of coverage activities required of the provider, the provider has fulfilled the requirements of RCW 48.102.080(1).

7. Within twenty days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has become subject to a life settlement contract. The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by RCW 48.102.090(2).

8. All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provision of state law relating to confidentiality of medical information, if not otherwise provided in this chapter.

9. All life settlement contracts entered into in this state shall provide that the owner may rescind the contract on or before fifteen days after the date it is executed by all parties thereto. Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given, and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract is considered rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the provider.

10. Within three business days after receipt from the owner of documents to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay the proceeds of the settlement to an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or federally chartered financial institution pending acknowledgment of the transfer by the issuer of the policy. The trustee or escrow agent shall be required to transfer the proceeds due to the owner within three business days of acknowledgment of the transfer from the insurer.

11. Failure to tender the life settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date disclosed to the owner renders the contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time the proceeds are tendered to and accepted by the owner. A failure to give written notice of the right of rescission under this section tolls the right of rescission until thirty days after the written notice of the right of rescission has been given.

12. Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual, or an owner to a broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of the policy. This section does not prohibit a broker from reducing the broker's fee below this percentage if the broker so chooses.

13. The broker shall disclose to the owner anything of value paid or given to a broker, which relate to a life settlement contract.

14. A person at any time prior to, or at the time of, the application for, or issuance of, a policy, or during a two-year period commencing with the date of issuance of the policy, shall not enter into a life settlement regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest, or surrender of the policy is to occur. This prohibition shall not apply if the owner certifies to the provider that:

    a. The policy was issued upon the owner's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least twenty-four months. The time covered under a group policy must be calculated without regard to a change in insurance carriers, provided the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship; or

    b. The owner submits independent evidence to the provider that one or more of the following conditions have been met within the two-year period:

       i. The owner or insured is terminally or chronically ill;

       ii. The owner or insured disposes of his or her ownership interests in a closely held corporation, pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued;

       iii. The owner's spouse dies;

       iv. The owner divorces his or her spouse;

       v. The owner retires from full-time employment;

       vi. The owner becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines that the disability prevents the owner from maintaining full-time employment; or

       vii. A final order, judgment, or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the owner, adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's assets;

    c. Copies of the independent evidence required by (b) of this subsection shall be submitted to the insurer when the provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the provider. This section does not prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of any policy;

    d. If the provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence provided for in (b)(i) of this subsection when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to the provider, the copy is deemed to establish that the settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section.

\[ [2009 c 104 § 14](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5195-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20104%20§%2014); \]

## 48.102.120 - Conflict of laws.
1. If there is more than one owner on a single policy, and the owners are residents of different states, the life settlement contract shall be governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the largest percentage ownership resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of residence of one owner agreed upon in writing by all of the owners. The law of the state of the insured shall govern in the event that equal owners fail to agree in writing upon a state of residence for jurisdictional purposes.

2. A provider from this state who enters into a life settlement contract with an owner who is a resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted regulations governing life settlement contracts, shall be governed in the effectuation of that life settlement contract by the statutes and regulations of the owner's state of residence. If the state in which the owner is a resident has not enacted statutes or regulations governing life settlement contracts, the provider shall give the owner notice that neither state regulates the transaction upon which he or she is entering. For transactions in those states, however, the provider is to maintain all records required if the transactions were executed in the state of residence. The forms used in those states need not be approved by the commissioner.

   a. Enter into a life settlement contract if such person knows or reasonably should have known that the life insurance policy was obtained by means of a false, deceptive or misleading application for such policy;

   b. Engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business if such person knows or reasonably should have known that the intent was to avoid the notice requirements of this chapter;

   c. Engage in any fraudulent act or practice in connection with any transaction relating to any settlement involving an owner who is a resident of this state;

   d. Issue, solicit, market, or otherwise promote the purchase of an insurance policy, not previously issued, for the sole purpose of, or with the primary emphasis on, settling the policy;

   e. If providing premium financing, receive any proceeds, fees, or other consideration from the policy or owner of the policy that are in addition to the amounts required to pay principal, interest, and any costs or expenses incurred by the lender or borrower in connection with the premium finance agreement, except for the event of a default, unless either the default on such a loan or transfer of the policy occurs pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any other person for the purpose of evading regulation under this chapter. Any payments, charges, fees, or other amounts received by a person providing premium financing in violation of this subsection shall be remitted to the original owner of the policy or to the original owner's estate if the original owner is not living at the time of the determination of overpayment;

   f. With respect to any settlement contract or insurance policy and a broker, knowingly solicit an offer from, effectuate a life settlement contract with, or make a sale to any provider, financing entity, or related provider trust that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such broker unless this relationship is disclosed to the owner;

   g. With respect to any life settlement contract or insurance policy and a provider, knowingly enter into a life settlement contract with an owner, if, in connection with such life settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a broker that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such provider or the financing entity or related provider trust that is involved in such settlement contract, unless this relationship is disclosed to the owner;

With respect to a provider, enter into a life settlement contract unless the life settlement promotional, advertising, and marketing materials, as may be prescribed by rule, have been filed with the commissioner. In no event shall any marketing materials expressly reference that the insurance is "free" for any period of time. The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause an owner to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time is a violation of this chapter;

   i. With respect to any life insurance producer, insurance company, broker, or provider make any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy; or
