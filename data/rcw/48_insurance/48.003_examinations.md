\[ [2007 c 82 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5717-S.SL.pdf?cite=2007%20c%2082%20§%201); \]

## 48.03.010 - Examination of insurers, bureaus.
1. The commissioner shall examine the affairs, transactions, accounts, records, documents, and assets of each authorized insurer as often as he or she deems advisable. The commissioner shall so examine each insurer holding a certificate of authority or certificate of registration not less frequently than every five years. Examination of an alien insurer may be limited to its insurance transactions in the United States. In scheduling and determining the nature, scope, and frequency of an examination, the commissioner shall consider such matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public accountants, and other criteria as set forth in the examiner's handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this section.

2. As often as the commissioner deems advisable and at least once in five years, the commissioner shall fully examine each rating organization and examining bureau licensed in this state. As often as he or she deems it advisable the commissioner may examine each advisory organization, any statistical reporting agent designated by the commissioner under RCW 48.29.017, and each joint underwriting or joint reinsurance group, association, or organization.

3. The commissioner shall in like manner examine each insurer or rating organization applying for authority to do business in this state.

4. In lieu of making an examination under this chapter, the commissioner may accept a full report of the last recent examination of a nondomestic rating or advisory organization, or joint underwriting or joint reinsurance group, association or organization, as prepared by the insurance supervisory official of the state of domicile or of entry. In lieu of an examination under this chapter of a foreign or alien insurer licensed in this state, the commissioner may accept an examination report on the company as prepared by the insurance department for the company's state of domicile or port-of-entry state until January 1, 1994. Thereafter, an examination report may be accepted only if: (a) That insurance department was at the time of the examination accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' financial regulation standards and accreditation program; or (b) the examination was performed either under the supervision of an accredited insurance department or with the participation of one or more examiners employed by an accredited state insurance department who, after a review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department.

5. The commissioner may elect to accept and rely on an audit report made by an independent certified public accountant for the insurer in the course of that part of the commissioner's examination covering the same general subject matter as the audit. The commissioner may incorporate the audit report in his or her report of the examination.

6. For the purposes of completing an examination of any company under this chapter, the commissioner may examine or investigate any managing general agent or any other person, or the business of any managing general agent or other person, insofar as that examination or investigation is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the examination of the company.

1. No later than sixty days after completion of each examination, the commissioner shall make a full written report of each examination made by him or her containing only facts ascertained from the accounts, records, and documents examined and from the sworn testimony of individuals, and such conclusions and recommendations as may reasonably be warranted from such facts.

2. The report shall be certified by the commissioner or by his or her examiner in charge of the examination, and shall be filed in the commissioner's office subject to subsection (3) of this section.

3. The commissioner shall furnish a copy of the examination report to the person examined not less than ten days and, unless the time is extended by the commissioner, not more than thirty days prior to the filing of the report for public inspection in the commissioner's office. If such person so requests in writing within such period, the commissioner shall hold a hearing to consider objections of such person to the report as proposed, and shall not so file the report until after such hearing and until after any modifications in the report deemed necessary by the commissioner have been made.

4. Within thirty days of the end of the period described in subsection (3) of this section, unless extended by order of the commissioner, the commissioner shall consider the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any relevant portions of the examiner's workpapers and enter an order:

   a. Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or corrections.

   c. Calling for an investigatory hearing with no less than twenty days' notice to the company for purposes of obtaining additional documentation, data, information, and testimony.

5. All orders entered under subsection (4) of this section must be accompanied by findings and conclusions resulting from the commissioner's consideration and review of the examination report, relevant examiner workpapers, and any written submissions or rebuttals.

A copy of the adopted examination report must be sent by certified mail or certifiable electronic means to each director at the director's residence address or to a personal email account.

2. Every other examination, whatsoever, or any part of the examination of any person domiciled or having its home offices in this state requiring travel and services outside this state, must be made by the commissioner or by examiners designated by the commissioner and must be at the expense of the person examined; but a domestic insurer must not be liable for the compensation of examiners employed by the commissioner for such services outside this state.

3. When making an examination under this chapter, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the cost of which must be borne by the person who is the subject of the examination, except as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

2. No cause of action may arise nor may any liability be imposed against any person for the act of communicating or delivering information or data to the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative or examiner pursuant to an examination made under this chapter, if that act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive.

3. This section does not modify a privilege or immunity previously enjoyed by a person identified in subsection (1) of this section.

4.
