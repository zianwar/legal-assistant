## 48.41.037 - Washington state health insurance pool account.
The Washington state health insurance pool account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from moneys specifically appropriated to the account must be deposited in the account. Expenditures from this account shall be used to cover deficits incurred by the Washington state health insurance pool under this chapter in excess of the threshold established in this section. To the extent funds are available in the account, funds shall be expended from the account to offset that portion of the deficit that would otherwise have to be recovered by imposing an assessment on members in excess of a threshold of seventy cents per insured person per month. The commissioner shall authorize expenditures from the account, to the extent that funds are available in the account, upon certification by the pool board that assessments will exceed the threshold level established in this section. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

Whether the assessment has reached the threshold of seventy cents per insured person per month shall be determined by dividing the total aggregate amount of assessment by the proportion of total assessed members. Thus, stop loss members shall be counted as one-tenth of a whole member in the denominator given that is the amount they are assessed proportionately relative to a fully insured medical member.

## 48.41.040 - Health insurance pool—Creation, membership, organization, operation, rules.

The remaining four members of the board shall be selected by election from among the members of the pool. The elected members shall, to the extent possible, include at least one representative of health care service contractors, one representative of health maintenance organizations, and one representative of commercial insurers which provides disability insurance.

4. The board shall submit to the commissioner a plan of operation for the pool and any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool. The commissioner shall, after notice and hearing pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, approve the plan of operation if it is determined to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool and provides for the sharing of pool losses on an equitable, proportionate basis among the members of the pool. The plan of operation shall become effective upon approval in writing by the commissioner consistent with the date on which the coverage under this chapter must be made available. If the board fails to submit a plan of operation within one hundred eighty days after the appointment of the board or any time thereafter fails to submit acceptable amendments to the plan, the commissioner shall, within ninety days after notice and hearing pursuant to chapters 34.05 and 48.04 RCW, adopt such rules as are necessary or advisable to effectuate this chapter. The rules shall continue in force until modified by the commissioner or superseded by a plan submitted by the board and approved by the commissioner.

## 48.41.090 - Financial participation in pool—Computation, deficit assessments.
1. Following the close of each accounting year, the pool administrator shall determine the total net cost of pool operation which shall include:

   a. Net premium (premiums less administrative expense allowances), the pool expenses of administration, and incurred losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses; and

   b. The amount of pool contributions specified in the state omnibus appropriations act for deposit into the health benefit exchange account under RCW 43.71.060, to assist with the transition of enrollees from the pool into the health benefit exchange created by chapter 43.71 RCW.

2. [Empty]

   a. Each member's proportion of participation in the pool shall be determined annually by the board based on annual statements and other reports deemed necessary by the board and filed by the member with the commissioner; and shall be determined by multiplying the total cost of pool operation by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction equals that member's total number of resident insured persons, including spouse and dependents, covered under all health plans in the state by that member during the preceding calendar year. The denominator of the fraction equals the total number of resident insured persons, including spouses and dependents, covered under all health plans in the state by all pool members during the preceding calendar year.

   b. For purposes of calculating the numerator and the denominator under (a) of this subsection:

      i. All health plans in the state by the state health care authority include only the uniform medical plan;

      ii. Each ten resident insured persons, including spouse and dependents, under a stop loss plan or the uniform medical plan shall count as one resident insured person;

      iii. Health plans serving medical care services program clients under RCW 74.09.035 are exempted from the calculation; and

      iv. Health plans established to serve elderly clients or medicaid clients with disabilities under chapter 74.09 RCW when the plan has been implemented on a demonstration or pilot project basis are exempted from the calculation until July 1, 2009.

   c. Except as provided in RCW 48.41.037, any deficit incurred by the pool, including pool contributions for deposit into the health benefit exchange account, shall be recouped by assessments among members apportioned under this subsection pursuant to the formula set forth by the board among members. The monthly per member assessment may not exceed the 2013 assessment level. If the maximum assessment is insufficient to cover a pool deficit the assessment shall be used first to pay all incurred losses and pool administrative expenses, with the remainder being available for deposit in the health benefit exchange account.

3. The board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member to fulfill its contractual obligations. If an assessment against a member is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other members in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in subsection (2) of this section. The member receiving such abatement or deferment shall remain liable to the pool for the deficiency.

4. Subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (2)(c) of this section, the pool administrator shall transfer the assessments for pool contributions for the operation of the health benefit exchange to the treasurer for deposit into the health benefit exchange account with the quarterly assessments for 2014 as specified in the state omnibus appropriations act. If assessments exceed actual losses and administrative expenses of the pool and pool contributions for deposit into the health benefit exchange account, the excess shall be held at interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce pool premiums. As used in this subsection, "future losses" includes reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

      iv. Any person becoming eligible for medicare on or after August 1, 2009, who does not have access to a reasonable choice of comprehensive medicare part C plans, as defined in (b) of this subsection, and who provides evidence of (A) a rejection for medical reasons, (B) a requirement of restrictive riders, (C) an up-rated premium, (D) a preexisting conditions limitation, or (E) lack of access to or for a comprehensive medicare supplemental insurance policy under chapter 48.66 RCW, the effect of any of which is to substantially reduce coverage from that received by a person considered a standard risk by at least one member within six months of the date of application.

6. The pool benefit policy may contain benefit limitations, exceptions, and cost shares such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that are consistent with managed care products, except that differential cost shares may be adopted by the board for nonnetwork providers under point of service plans. No limitation, exception, or reduction may be used that would exclude coverage for any disease, illness, or injury.

   a. The pool may not reject an individual for health plan coverage based upon preexisting conditions of the individual or deny, exclude, or otherwise limit coverage for an individual's preexisting health conditions; except that it shall impose a six-month benefit waiting period for preexisting conditions for which medical advice was given, for which a health care provider recommended or provided treatment, or for which a prudent layperson would have sought advice or treatment, within six months before the effective date of coverage. The preexisting condition waiting period shall not apply to prenatal care services or benefits for outpatient prescription drugs. The pool may not avoid the requirements of this section through the creation of a new rate classification or the modification of an existing rate classification.

   a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the pool shall credit any preexisting condition waiting period in its plans for a person who was enrolled at any time during the sixty-three day period immediately preceding the date of application for the new pool plan. For the person previously enrolled in a group health benefit plan, the pool must credit the aggregate of all periods of preceding coverage not separated by more than sixty-three days toward the waiting period of the new health plan. For the person previously enrolled in an individual health benefit plan other than a catastrophic health plan, the pool must credit the period of coverage the person was continuously covered under the immediately preceding health plan toward the waiting period of the new health plan. For the purposes of this subsection, a preceding health plan includes an employer-provided self-funded health plan.

   b. The pool shall waive any preexisting condition waiting period for a person who is an eligible individual as defined in section 2741(b) of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 300gg-41(b)).

9. If an application is made for the pool policy as a result of rejection by a carrier, then the date of application to the carrier, rather than to the pool, should govern for purposes of determining preexisting condition credit.

10. The pool shall contract with organizations that provide care management that has been demonstrated to be effective and shall encourage enrollees who are eligible for care management services to participate. The pool may encourage the use of shared decision making and certified decision aids for preference-sensitive care areas.

1. Coverage shall provide that health insurance benefits are applicable to children of the person in whose name the policy is issued including adopted and newly born natural children. Coverage shall also include necessary care and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects and birth abnormalities. If payment of a specific premium is required to provide coverage for the child, the policy may require that notification of the birth or adoption of a child and payment of the required premium must be furnished to the pool within thirty-one days after the date of birth or adoption in order to have the coverage continued beyond the thirty-one day period. For purposes of this subsection, a child is deemed to be adopted, and benefits are payable, when the child is physically placed for purposes of adoption under the laws of this state with the person in whose name the policy is issued; and, when the person in whose name the policy is issued assumes financial responsibility for the medical expenses of the child. For purposes of this subsection, "newly born" means, and benefits are payable, from the moment of birth.

2.

The replacement plan must include all of the services covered under the replaced plan, and must not significantly limit access to the kind of services covered under the replacement plan through unreasonable cost-sharing requirements or otherwise. The pool may also allow individuals who are covered by a plan that is being replaced an unrestricted right to transfer to a fully comparable plan.

   b. The guarantee of continuity of coverage provided by this section requires that if the pool discontinues offering a plan: (i) The pool must provide notice to each individual of the discontinuation at least ninety days prior to the date of the discontinuation; (ii) the pool must offer to each individual provided coverage under the discontinued plan the option to enroll in any other plan currently offered by the pool for which the individual is otherwise eligible; and (iii) in exercising the option to discontinue a plan and in offering the option of coverage under (b)(ii) of this subsection, the pool must act uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of enrolled individuals or individuals who may become eligible for this coverage.

In its evaluation, the board must request input from the constituents represented by the board members.

   d. The guarantee of continuity of coverage provided by this section does not apply if the pool has zero enrollment in a plan.

5. The pool may not change the rates for pool policies except on a class basis, with a clear disclosure in the policy of the pool's right to do so.

6. A pool policy offered under this chapter shall provide that, upon the death of the individual in whose name the policy is issued, every other individual then covered under the policy may elect, within a period specified in the policy, to continue coverage under the same or a different policy.

7. All pool policies issued on or after January 1, 2014, must reflect the new eligibility requirements of RCW 48.41.100.

2. Each health insurance policy issued by the pool shall provide coverage for:

Wellness and preventive services that are provided or reimbursed at a lesser copayment, coinsurance, or other cost sharing than other medical and surgical services are excluded from this comparison. If the policy imposes a maximum out-of-pocket limit or stop loss, it shall be a single limit or stop loss for medical, surgical, and mental health services. If the policy imposes any deductible, mental health services shall be included with medical and surgical services for the purpose of meeting the deductible requirement. Treatment limitations or any other financial requirements on coverage for mental health services are only allowed if the same limitations or requirements are imposed on coverage for medical and surgical services; and

   b. Prescription drugs intended to treat any of the disorders covered in subsection (1) of this section to the same extent, and under the same terms and conditions, as other prescription drugs covered by the policy.

3. This section does not prohibit a requirement that mental health services be medically necessary, if a comparable requirement is applicable to medical and surgical services.

4. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the management of mental health services if a comparable requirement is applicable to medical and surgical services.

If the review under subsection (1) of this section indicates a continued need for coverage through the pool after December 31, 2013, the board shall submit recommendations regarding any modifications to pool eligibility requirements for new and ongoing enrollment after December 31, 2013. The recommendations must address any needed modifications to the standard health questionnaire or other eligibility screening tool that could be used in a manner consistent with federal law to determine eligibility for enrollment in the pool.

3. The board shall complete an analysis of current pool assessment requirements in relation to assessments that will fund the reinsurance program and recommend changes to pool assessments or any credits against assessments that may be considered for the reinsurance program.

5. The board shall revisit the study of eligibility completed in 2012 with another review of the populations that may need ongoing access to coverage through the pool, to be submitted to the governor and legislature by November 1, 2015.
