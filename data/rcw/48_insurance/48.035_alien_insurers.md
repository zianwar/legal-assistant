## 48.35.020 - Deposit required—Amount.
1. An alien insurer may use this state as a state of entry to transact insurance in the United States by maintaining in this state a deposit of assets in a solvent trust company or other solvent financial institution having trust powers domiciled in this state and so designated by the commissioner. The commissioner's designated depositories are authorized to receive and hold a deposit of assets. A deposit so held is at the expense of the insurer. A solvent financial institution domiciled in this state, the deposits of which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation and which is a member of the federal reserve system, may be designated as the commissioner's depository to receive and hold a deposit of assets.

2. The deposit, together with other trust deposits of the insurer held in the United States for the same purpose, must be in an amount not less than the higher of deposits required of an alien insurer under RCW 48.05.090 or five hundred thousand dollars and consist of eligible assets as set forth in RCW 48.16.030.

3. The deposit may be referred to as "trusteed assets."

\[ [1991 c 268 § 12](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1971-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20268%20§%2012); \]

For the purpose of making deposits required by another state in which the insurer is, or becomes, an authorized insurer and for the protection of the insurer's policyholders or creditors, or both, in the state or United States, if the withdrawal does not reduce the insurer's deposit in this state to an amount less than the minimum deposit required.

The domestic insurer is considered as having the age as the oldest of the two parties to the domestication agreement for purposes of laws relating to age of company.

2. All deposits of the United States branch held by the commissioner, or by state officers, or other state regulatory agencies pursuant to requirements of state laws, are deemed to be held as security for the satisfaction by the domestic insurer of all liabilities to policyholders within the United States assumed from the United States branch; and the deposits are deemed to be assets of the domestic insurer and are reported as such in the annual financial statements and other reports that the domestic insurer may be required to file. Upon the ultimate release by a state officer or agency of a deposit, the securities and cash constituting the released deposit is delivered and paid over to the domestic insurer as the lawful successor in interest to the United States branch.

3. Contemporaneously with the consummation of the domestication of the United States branch, the commissioner shall direct the trustee, if any, of the United States branch's trusteed assets, as set forth in RCW 48.35.020, to transfer and deliver to the domestic insurer all assets, if any, held by such trustee.

\[ [1991 c 268 § 20](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1971-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20268%20§%2020); \]
