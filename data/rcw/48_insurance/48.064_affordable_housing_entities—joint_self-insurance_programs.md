## 48.64.005 - Intent—Liberal construction.
This chapter is intended to provide authority for two or more affordable housing entities to participate in a joint self-insurance program covering property or liability risks. This chapter provides affordable housing entities with the exclusive source of authority to jointly self-insure property and liability risks, jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance, and to contract for risk management, claims, and administrative services with other affordable housing entities. This chapter must be liberally construed to grant affordable housing entities maximum flexibility in jointly self-insuring to the extent the self-insurance programs are operated in a safe and sound manner. This chapter is intended to require prior approval for the establishment of every joint self-insurance program. In addition, this chapter is intended to require every joint self-insurance program for affordable housing entities established under this chapter to notify the state of the existence of the program and to comply with the regulatory and statutory standards governing the management and operation of the programs as provided in this chapter. This chapter is not intended to authorize or regulate self-insurance of unemployment compensation under chapter 50.44 RCW or industrial insurance under chapter 51.14 RCW.

## 48.64.020 - Rules necessary to implement multistate program—State risk manager.
Prior to the approval of a multistate joint self-insurance program for affordable housing entities, the state risk manager shall adopt rules further clarifying the definitions of "affordable housing" and "affordable housing entity" as defined in RCW 48.64.010, and the conditions and limitations under which affordable housing entities may participate or be expelled from the joint self-insurance program.

\[ [2009 c 314 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5665-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20314%20§%203); \]

1. The governing body of an affordable housing entity may join or form a self-insurance program together with one or more other affordable housing entities, and may jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance with one or more other affordable housing entities for property and liability risks only as permitted under this chapter. Affordable housing entities may contract for or hire personnel to provide risk management, claims, and administrative services in accordance with this chapter.

2. The agreement to form a joint self-insurance program may include the organization of a separate legal or administrative entity with powers delegated to the entity. The entity may be a nonprofit corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or other form of entity, whether organized under the laws of this state or another state.

3. If provided for in the organizational documents, a joint self-insurance program may, in conformance with this chapter:

   a. Contract or otherwise provide for risk management and loss control services;

   b. Contract or otherwise provide legal counsel for the defense of claims and other legal services;

   c. Consult with the state insurance commissioner and the state risk manager;

   a. Service upon the state risk manager as attorney constitutes service upon the program. Service upon joint self-insurance programs subject to this chapter may only occur by service upon the state risk manager. At the time of service, the plaintiff shall pay to the state risk manager a fee to be set by the state risk manager, taxable as costs in the action.

   b. With the initial filing for approval with the state risk manager, each joint self-insurance program must designate by name and address the person to whom the state risk manager must forward legal process that is served upon him or her. The joint self-insurance program may change this person by filing a new designation.

   c. The appointment of the state risk manager as attorney is irrevocable, binds any successor in interest or to the assets or liabilities of the joint self-insurance program, and remains in effect as long as there is in force in this state any contract made by the joint self-insurance program or liabilities or duties arising from the contract.

   d. The state risk manager shall keep a record of the day and hour of service upon him or her of all legal process. A copy of the process, by registered mail with return receipt requested, must be sent by the state risk manager to the person designated to receive legal process by the joint self-insurance program in its most recent designation filed with the state risk manager. Proceedings must not commence against the joint self-insurance program, and the program must not be required to appear, plead, or answer, until the expiration of forty days after the date of service upon the state risk manager.

## 48.64.050 - Management and operation of programs—Rules adopted by state risk manager.

The state risk manager shall approve or disapprove the proposed change within sixty days of receipt of the notice. If the state risk manager denies a requested change, the state risk manager shall specify in detail the reasons for the denial and the manner in which the program would fail to meet the requirements of this chapter or any rules adopted in accordance with this chapter.

An employee or official of a participating affordable housing entity in a joint self-insurance program may not accept or solicit anything of value for personal benefit or for the benefit of others under circumstances in which it can be reasonably inferred that the employee's or official's independence of judgment is impaired with respect to the management and operation of the program.

\[ [2009 c 314 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5665-S.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20314%20§%2013); \]
