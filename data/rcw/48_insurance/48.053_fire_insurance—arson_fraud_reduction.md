2. A fire insurance policy may not be issued to insure any property within a class of occupancy within a geographic area or within a geographic area designated by the chief of the Washington state patrol, through the director of fire protection, as having an abnormally high incidence of arson until the applicant has submitted an anti-arson application and the insurer or the insurer's representative has inspected the property. The application shall be prescribed by the chief of the Washington state patrol, through the director of fire protection, and shall contain but not be limited to the following:

   a. The name and address of the prospective insured and any mortgagees or other parties having an ownership interest in the property to be insured;

   d. Fire losses exceeding one thousand dollars during the previous five years for property in which the prospective insured held an equity interest or mortgage;

   e. Current corrective orders pertaining to fire, safety, health, building, or construction codes that have not been complied with within the time period or any extension of such time period authorized by the authority issuing such corrective order applicable to the property to be insured;

   f. Present or anticipated occupancy of the structure, and whether a certificate of occupancy has been issued;

   g. Signature and title, if any, of the person submitting the application.

3. If the facts required to be reported by subsection (2) of this section materially change, the insured shall notify the insurer of any such change within fourteen days.

4. An anti-arson application is not required for: (a) Fire insurance policies covering one to four-unit owner-occupied residential dwellings; (b) policies existing as of June 10, 1982; or (c) the renewal of these policies.

5. An anti-arson application shall contain a notice stating: "Designation of a class of occupancy within a geographic area or geographic areas as having an abnormally high incidence of arson shall not be a valid reason for cancellation, refusal to issue or renew, modification, or increasing the premium for any fire insurance policy."
