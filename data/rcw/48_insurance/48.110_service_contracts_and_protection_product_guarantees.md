## 48.110.010 - Finding—Declaration—Purpose.
The legislature finds that increasing numbers of businesses are selling service contracts for repair, replacement, and maintenance of motor vehicles, appliances, computers, electronic equipment, and other consumer products. There are risks that contract obligors will close or otherwise be unable to fulfill their contract obligations that could result in unnecessary and preventable losses to citizens of this state. The legislature declares that it is necessary to establish standards that will safeguard the public from possible losses arising from the conduct or cessation of the business of service contract obligors or the mismanagement of funds paid for service contracts. The purpose of this chapter is to create a legal framework within which service contracts may be sold in this state and to set forth requirements for conducting a service contract business.

## 48.110.100 - Termination of reimbursement insurance policy.
As applicable, an insurer that issued a reimbursement insurance policy shall not terminate the policy until a notice of termination in accordance with RCW 48.18.290 has been given to the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider and has been delivered to the commissioner. The termination of a reimbursement insurance policy does not reduce the issuer's responsibility for service contracts issued by service contract providers or protection product guarantees issued by protection product guarantee providers prior to the effective date of the termination.

\[ [2006 c 274 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2553-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20274%20§%2011); [1999 c 112 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2052.SL.pdf?cite=1999%20c%20112%20§%2011); \]

## 48.110.110 - Service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider—Agent of insurer which issued reimbursement insurance policy.
1. Service contract providers or protection product guarantee providers are considered to be the agent of the insurer which issued the reimbursement insurance policy for purposes of obligating the insurer to service contract holders or protection product guarantee holders in accordance with the service contract or protection product guarantee holders and this chapter. Payment of the provider fee by the consumer to the service contract seller, service contract provider, or administrator or payment of consideration for the protection product to the protection product seller constitutes payment by the consumer to the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider and to the insurer which issued the reimbursement insurance policy. In cases where a service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider is acting as an administrator and enlists other service contract providers or protection product guarantee providers, the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider acting as the administrator shall notify the insurer of the existence and identities of the other service contract providers or protection product guarantee providers.

2. This chapter does not prevent or limit the right of an insurer which issued a reimbursement insurance policy to seek indemnification or subrogation against a service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider if the issuer pays or is obligated to pay the service contract holder or protection product guarantee holder sums that the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider was obligated to pay under the provisions of the service contract or protection product guarantee.

Upon request of the commissioner, the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider shall make all accounts, books, and records concerning service contracts or protection products offered, issued, or sold by the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider available to the commissioner which are necessary to enable the commissioner to determine compliance or noncompliance with this chapter.

2. The commissioner may take actions under RCW 48.02.080 or 48.04.050 which are necessary or appropriate to enforce this chapter and the commissioner's rules and orders, and to protect service contract holders or protection product guarantee holders in this state.

## 48.110.130 - Denial, suspension, or revocation of registration—Immediate suspension without notice or hearing—Fine.
1. The commissioner may, subject to chapter 48.04 RCW, deny, suspend, or revoke the registration of a service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider if the commissioner finds that the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider:

   a. Has violated this chapter or the commissioner's rules and orders;

   b. Has refused to be investigated or to produce its accounts, records, and files for investigation, or if any of its officers have refused to give information with respect to its affairs or refused to perform any other legal obligation as to an investigation, when required by the commissioner;

   c. Has, without just cause, refused to pay proper claims or perform services arising under its contracts or has, without just cause, caused service contract holders or protection product guarantee holders to accept less than the amount due them or caused service contract holders or protection product guarantee holders to employ attorneys or bring suit against the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider to secure full payment or settlement of claims;

   d. Is affiliated with or under the same general management or interlocking directorate or ownership as another service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider which unlawfully transacts business in this state without having a registration;

   e. At any time fails to meet any qualification for which issuance of the registration could have been refused had such failure then existed and been known to the commissioner;

   f. Has been convicted of, or has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony;

   g. Is under suspension or revocation in another state with respect to its service contract business or protection product business;

   a. The commissioner may, without advance notice or hearing thereon, immediately suspend the registration of a service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider if the commissioner finds that any of the following circumstances exist:

      ii. A proceeding for receivership, conservatorship, rehabilitation, or other delinquency proceeding regarding the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider has been commenced in any state; or

      iii. The business practices of the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider otherwise pose an imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare of the residents of this state.

   b. However, nothing in this subsection shall in any way be construed to limit the authority of the commissioner to take action against a service contract provider or a protection product guarantee provider granted by this chapter.

3. If the commissioner finds that grounds exist for the suspension or revocation of a registration issued under this chapter, the commissioner may, in lieu of suspension or revocation, impose a fine upon the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider in an amount not more than two thousand dollars per violation.
