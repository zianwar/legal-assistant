## 86.18.010 - Declaration of purpose.
Economic development and growth of the state is dependent on the control of flood waters. The legislature declares, in the exercise of its sovereign and police powers, that the purpose of this chapter is to provide for contributions of funds for assisting political subdivisions of the state in the protection of lands from inundation; the protection of public highways; the control of storm drainage; the maintenance of stream channels and water courses; and the protection of life and property.

It is the intent of the legislature that funds be provided to political subdivisions of the state to assist in the development of those flood control improvements and projects, which cannot be reasonably and practicably financed through the normal methods of financing available to such political subdivisions.

2. Engineering studies and plans have been made and filed with the county engineer of the county in which the project is located, or the county engineers of all counties in which the project is located, if it is located in more than one county.

3. The estimate of cost of acquisition of necessary lands, rights-of-way and construction of the project or improvements, together with adequate supporting data have been completed and filed with the department of ecology.

4. A comprehensive plan for the area involved has been completed and filed with the department.

5. The political subdivision desiring a contribution has made an application for a contribution to the department showing the estimated cost of the project and the requested contribution.

Contributions to a political subdivision for a specific project shall not exceed fifty percent of the cost of acquisition of necessary lands and rights-of-way, and construction of the project or works of improvement.
