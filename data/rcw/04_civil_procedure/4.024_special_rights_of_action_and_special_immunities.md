## 4.24.010 - Action for injury or death of child.
1. A parent or legal guardian who has regularly contributed to the support of his or her minor child, and a parent or legal guardian who has had significant involvement in the life of an adult child, may maintain or join as a party an action as plaintiff for the injury or death of the child. For purposes of this section, "significant involvement" means demonstrated support of an emotional, psychological, or financial nature within the parent-child relationship, at or reasonably near the time of death, or at or reasonably near the time of the incident causing death, including either giving or receiving emotional, psychological, or financial support to or from the child.

2. In addition to recovering damages for the child's health care expenses, loss of the child's services, loss of the child's financial support, and other economic losses, damages may be also recovered under this section for the loss of love and companionship of the child, loss of the child's emotional support, and for injury to or destruction of the parent-child relationship, in such amounts as determined by a trier of fact to be just under all the circumstances of the case.

3. An action may be maintained by a parent or legal guardian under this section, regardless of whether or not the child has attained the age of majority, only if the child has no spouse, state registered domestic partner, or children.

4. Each parent is entitled to recover for his or her own loss separately from the other parent regardless of marital status, even though this section creates only one cause of action.

5. If one parent brings an action under this section and the other parent is not named as a plaintiff, notice of the institution of the suit, together with a copy of the complaint, shall be served upon the other parent: PROVIDED, That notice shall be required only if parentage has been duly established.

Such notice shall be in compliance with the statutory requirements for a summons. Such notice shall state that the other parent must join as a party to the suit within twenty days or the right to recover damages under this section shall be barred. Failure of the other parent to timely appear shall bar such parent's action to recover any part of an award made to the party instituting the suit.

## 4.24.490 - Indemnification of state employees.
1. The state shall indemnify and hold harmless its employees in the amount of any judgment obtained or fine levied against an employee in any state or federal court, or in the amount of the settlement of a claim, or shall pay the judgment, fine, or settlement, if the act or omission that gave rise to the civil or criminal liability was in good faith and occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment or duties and the employee is being represented in accordance with RCW 4.92.070.

## 4.24.495 - Liability of public employers for deducting or receiving agency or fair share fees from public employees—Findings and declaration—Definitions.
1. The legislature finds and declares application of this section to pending claims and actions clarifies existing state law rather than changes it. Public employees who paid agency or fair share fees as a condition of public employment in accordance with state law and supreme court precedent before June 27, 2018, had no legitimate expectation of receiving that money under any available cause of action. Public employers and employee organizations who relied on, and abided by, state law and supreme court precedent in deducting and accepting those fees were not liable to refund them. Agency or fair share fees paid for collective bargaining representation that employee organizations were obligated by state law to provide to public employees. Application of this section to pending claims will preserve, rather than interfere with, important reliance interests.

2. Public employers and an employee organization, or any of their employees or agents, are not liable for, and have a complete defense to, any claims or actions under the law of this state for requiring, deducting, receiving, or retaining agency or fair share fees from public employees, and current or former public employees do not have standing to pursue these claims or actions, if the fees were permitted at the time under the laws of this state then in force and paid, through payroll deduction or otherwise, before June 27, 2018.

   a. This section applies to all claims and actions pending on July 28, 2019, and to claims and actions filed on or after July 28, 2019.

   b. This section may not be interpreted to infer that any relief made unavailable by this section would otherwise be available.

3. This section is necessary to provide certainty to public employers and employee organizations that relied on state law, and to avoid disruption of public employee labor relations, after the supreme court's decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31 (2018) 138 S.Ct. 2448.

4. For purposes of this section:

   a. "Employee organization" means any organization that functioned as an exclusive collective bargaining representative for public employees under any statute, ordinance, regulation, or other state or local law, and any labor organization with which it was affiliated.

   b. "Public employer" means any public employer including, but not limited to, the state, a court, a city, a county, a city and county, a school district, a community college district, an institution of higher education and its board or regents, a transit district, any public authority, any public agency, any other political subdivision or public corporation, or any other entity considered a public employer for purposes of the labor relations statutes of Washington.

## 4.24.500 - Good faith communication to government agency—Legislative findings—Purpose.
Information provided by citizens concerning potential wrongdoing is vital to effective law enforcement and the efficient operation of government. The legislature finds that the threat of a civil action for damages can act as a deterrent to citizens who wish to report information to federal, state, or local agencies. The costs of defending against such suits can be severely burdensome. The purpose of RCW 4.24.500 through 4.24.520 is to protect individuals who make good-faith reports to appropriate governmental bodies.

\[ [1989 c 234 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c234.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20234%20§%201); \]

## 4.24.510 - Communication to government agency or self-regulatory organization—Immunity from civil liability.
A person who communicates a complaint or information to any branch or agency of federal, state, or local government, or to any self-regulatory organization that regulates persons involved in the securities or futures business and that has been delegated authority by a federal, state, or local government agency and is subject to oversight by the delegating agency, is immune from civil liability for claims based upon the communication to the agency or organization regarding any matter reasonably of concern to that agency or organization. A person prevailing upon the defense provided for in this section is entitled to recover expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in establishing the defense and in addition shall receive statutory damages of ten thousand dollars. Statutory damages may be denied if the court finds that the complaint or information was communicated in bad faith.

## 4.24.520 - Good faith communication to government agency—When agency or attorney general may defend against lawsuit—Costs and fees.
In order to protect the free flow of information from citizens to their government, an agency receiving a complaint or information under RCW 4.24.510 may intervene in and defend against any suit precipitated by the communication to the agency. In the event that a local governmental agency does not intervene in and defend against a suit arising from any communication protected under chapter 234, Laws of 1989, the office of the attorney general may intervene in and defend against the suit. An agency prevailing upon the defense provided for in RCW 4.24.510 shall be entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in establishing the defense. If the agency fails to establish the defense provided for in RCW 4.24.510, the party bringing the action shall be entitled to recover from the agency costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in proving the defense inapplicable or invalid.

2. Except for the information specifically required under subsection (5) of this section, the extent of the public disclosure of relevant and necessary information shall be rationally related to: (a) The level of risk posed by the offender to the community; (b) the locations where the offender resides, expects to reside, or is regularly found; and (c) the needs of the affected community members for information to enhance their individual and collective safety.

3. Except for the information specifically required under subsection (5) of this section, local law enforcement agencies shall consider the following guidelines in determining the extent of a public disclosure made under this section: (a) For offenders classified as risk level I, the agency shall share information with other appropriate law enforcement agencies and, if the offender is a student, the public or private school regulated under Title 28A RCW or chapter 72.40 RCW which the offender is attending, or planning to attend.

   b. A sex offender shall be classified as a risk level I if his or her risk assessment and other information or factors deemed relevant by the law enforcement agency indicate he or she is at a low risk to sexually reoffend within the community at large. A sex offender shall be classified as a risk level II if his or her risk assessment and other information or factors deemed relevant by the law enforcement agency indicate he or she is at a moderate risk to sexually reoffend within the community at large.

The decision of a law enforcement agency or official to classify an offender to a risk level other than the one assigned by the department of corrections, the department of social and health services, or the indeterminate sentence review board, or the release of any relevant and necessary information based on that different classification shall not, by itself, be considered gross negligence or bad faith. The immunity provided under this section applies to the release of relevant and necessary information to other public officials, public employees, or public agencies, and to the general public.

8. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, nothing in this section shall impose any liability upon a public official, public employee, or public agency for failing to release information authorized under this section.

9. Nothing in this section implies that information regarding persons designated in subsection (1) of this section is confidential except as may otherwise be provided by law.

   c. Permits minor participants to use facilities or engage in agritourism activities that are not reasonably appropriate for their age. This provision shall not be interpreted to relieve a parent or guardian of a minor participant of the duty to reasonably supervise the minor's participation in agritourism activities, including assessing whether the minor's participation in an agritourism activity is reasonably appropriate for his or her age.

## 4.24.835 - Agritourism—Warning notice.
1. Every agritourism professional must post and maintain signs that contain the warning notice specified in subsection (2) of this section. The sign must be placed in a clearly visible location at the entrance to the agritourism location and at the site of the agritourism activity. The warning notice must consist of a sign in black letters, with each letter to be a minimum of one inch in height. Every written contract entered into by an agritourism professional for the providing of professional services, instruction, or the rental of equipment to a participant, whether or not the contract involves agritourism activities on or off the location or at the site of the agritourism activity, must contain in clearly readable print the warning notice specified in subsection (2) of this section.

2. The sign and contracts described in subsection (1) of this section must contain the following notice of warning:

"WARNING

Under Washington state law, there is limited liability for an injury to or death of a participant in an agritourism activity conducted at this agritourism location if such an injury or death results exclusively from the inherent risks of the agritourism activity. Inherent risks of agritourism activities include, among others, risks of injury inherent to land, equipment, and animals, as well as the potential for you to act in a negligent manner that may contribute to your injury or death. We are required to ensure that in any activity involving minor children, only age-appropriate access to activities, equipment, and animals is permitted. You are assuming the risk of participating in this agritourism activity."

3. Failure to comply with the requirements concerning warning signs and notices provided in this section prohibits an agritourism professional from invoking the privilege of immunity provided by this section, section 1, chapter 227, Laws of 2017, and RCW 4.24.830 and 4.24.832 and may be introduced as evidence in any claim for damages.

## 4.24.840 - Effect of sexual harassment or sexual assault nondisclosure agreement on discovery and witness availability.
1. In any civil judicial or administrative action relating to sexual harassment or sexual assault, a nondisclosure policy or agreement that purports to limit the ability of any person to produce evidence regarding past instances of sexual harassment or sexual assault by a party to the civil action does not affect discovery or the availability of witness testimony relating to that civil action. Any provision of a nondisclosure policy or agreement including any arbitration agreement or decision that would limit, prevent, or punish such disclosure is contrary to public policy and unenforceable. However, the court or presiding officer shall enter appropriate orders upon motion of any party supported by affidavit or sworn declaration, or without motion but on the court's or presiding officer's own accord, to ensure that the identity of any person who is or is alleged to be a victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault is not made public as a result of a disclosure made under this section, unless such person consents.

2. The provisions of this section do not alter admissibility standards of evidence for the court or presiding officer to decide whether the probative value of evidence offered outweighs the potential prejudice.
