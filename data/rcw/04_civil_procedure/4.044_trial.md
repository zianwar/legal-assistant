## 4.44.020 - Notice of trial—Note of issue.
At any time after the issues of fact are completed in any case by the service of complaint and answer or reply when necessary, as herein provided, either party may cause the issues of fact to be brought on for trial, by serving upon the opposite party a notice of trial at least three days before any day provided by rules of court for setting causes for trial, which notice shall give the title of the cause as in the pleadings, and notify the opposite party that the issues in such action will be brought on for trial at the time set by the court; and the party giving such notice of trial shall, at least five days before the day of setting such causes for trial file with the clerk of the court a note of issue containing the title of the action, the names of the attorneys and the date when the last pleading was served; and the clerk shall thereupon enter the cause upon the trial docket according to the date of the issue.

In case an issue of law raised upon the pleadings is desired to be brought on for argument, either party shall, at least five days before the day set apart by the court under its rules for hearing issues of law, serve upon the opposite party a like notice of trial and furnish the clerk of the court with a note of issue as above provided, which note of issue shall specify that the issue to be tried is an issue of law; and the clerk of the court shall thereupon enter such action upon the motion docket of the court.

When a cause has once been placed upon either docket of the court, if not tried or argued at the time for which notice was given, it need not be noticed for a subsequent session or day, but shall remain upon the docket from session to session or from law day to law day until final disposition or stricken off by the court. The party upon whom notice of trial is served may file the note of issue and cause the action to be placed upon the calendar without further notice.

## 4.44.170 - Particular causes of challenge.

3. For the existence of a defect in the functions or organs of the body which satisfies the court that the challenged person is incapable of performing the duties of a juror in the particular action without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging.

\[ [1975 1st ex.s. c 203 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1975ex1c203.pdf?cite=1975%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20203%20§%203); Code 1881 § 211; [1877 p 44 § 215](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2044%20§%20215); [1869 p 52 § 215](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%2052%20§%20215); RRS § 329; \]

3. Having served as a juror on a previous trial in the same action, or in another action between the same parties for the same cause of action, or in a criminal action by the state against either party, upon substantially the same facts or transaction.

4. Interest on the part of the juror in the event of the action, or the principal question involved therein, excepting always, the interest of the juror as a member or citizen of the county or municipal corporation.

\[ [2003 c 406 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1675-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20406%20§%207); Code 1881 § 212; [1877 p 44 § 216](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2044%20§%20216); [1869 p 52 § 216](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%2052%20§%20216); [1854 p 165 § 187](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1854%20p%20165%20§%20187); RRS § 330; \]

## 4.44.190 - Challenge for actual bias.
A challenge for actual bias may be taken for the cause mentioned in RCW 4.44.170(2). But on the trial of such challenge, although it should appear that the juror challenged has formed or expressed an opinion upon what he or she may have heard or read, such opinion shall not of itself be sufficient to sustain the challenge, but the court must be satisfied, from all the circumstances, that the juror cannot disregard such opinion and try the issue impartially.

\[ [2003 c 406 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1675-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20406%20§%208); Code 1881 § 213; [1877 p 44 § 217](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2044%20§%20217); [1869 p 53 § 217](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%2053%20§%20217); RRS § 331; \]

## 4.44.210 - Peremptory challenges, how taken.
The jurors having been examined as to their qualifications, first by the plaintiff and then by the defendant, and passed for cause, the peremptory challenges shall be conducted as follows, to wit:

The plaintiff may challenge one, and then the defendant may challenge one, and so alternately until the peremptory challenges shall be exhausted. During this alternating process, if one of the parties declines to exercise a peremptory challenge, then that party may no longer peremptorily challenge any of the jurors in the group for which challenges are then being considered and may only peremptorily challenge any jurors later added to that group. A refusal to challenge by either party in the said order of alternation shall not prevent the adverse party from using the full number of challenges.

\[ [2003 c 406 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1675-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20406%20§%209); Code 1881 § 215; [1877 p 45 § 219](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2045%20§%20219); [1869 p 53 § 219](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%2053%20§%20219); RRS § 333; \]

1. Challenges for cause.

2. Peremptory challenges.

\[ [2003 c 406 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1675-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20406%20§%2010); Code 1881 § 216; [1877 p 45 § 220](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2045%20§%20220); [1869 p 53 § 220](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%2053%20§%20220); RRS § 334; \]

## 4.44.230 - Exceptions to challenges—Determination.
The challenge may be excepted to by the adverse party for insufficiency, and if so, the court shall determine the sufficiency thereof, assuming the facts alleged therein to be true. The challenge may be denied by the adverse party, and if so, the court shall determine the facts and decide the issue.

\[ [2003 c 406 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1675-S.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20406%20§%2011); Code 1881 § 217; [1877 p 45 § 221](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%2045%20§%20221); [1869 p 53 § 221](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%2053%20§%20221); RRS § 335; \]

## 4.44.240 - Challenge determination.
When facts are determined under RCW 4.44.230, the rules of evidence applicable to testimony offered upon the trial of an ordinary issue of fact shall govern. The juror challenged, or any other person otherwise competent may be examined as a witness by either party. If the challenge is sustained, the juror shall be dismissed from the case; otherwise, the juror shall be retained.
