## 70A.445.005 - Intent.
Antifouling paints and coatings are necessary for the proper performance and preservation of boats and other marine craft. However, many of these substances contain copper, biocides, and other chemicals that are toxic to many aquatic organisms, including salmon. The legislature intends to phase out the use of copper-based and other antifouling paints and coatings that pose an undue threat to the environment when used on recreational water vessels. The legislature also intends to encourage the development of safer alternatives to traditional antifouling paints and coatings.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Department" means the department of ecology.

2. "Director" means the director of the department of ecology.

3. [Empty]

   a. "Recreational water vessel" means any vessel that is no more than sixty-five feet in length and is: (i) Manufactured or used primarily for pleasure; or (ii) leased, rented, or chartered by a person for the pleasure of that person.

   b. "Recreational water vessel" does not include a vessel that is subject to United States coast guard inspection and that: (i) Is engaged in commercial use; or (ii) carries paying passengers.

## 70A.445.020 - Antifouling paint—Review—Report to the legislature—Restrictions on sale and application.
1. The department will conduct a review of information about antifouling paints and ingredients, including information received from manufacturers and others pursuant to this chapter; information on the feasibility of best management practices and nonbiocidal antifouling alternatives; and any additional scientific or technical information and studies it determines are relevant to that review.

2. The department must submit a report to the legislature summarizing its findings no later than June 30, 2024. Prior to submitting the report to the legislature, the department will conduct a public comment process to obtain expertise, input, and a review of the department's proposed determinations by relevant stakeholders and other interested parties. The input received from the public comment process must be considered before finalizing the report.

3. If the department determines that safer and effective alternatives to copper-based antifouling paints are feasible, reasonable, and readily available, then:

   a. Beginning January 1, 2026, no manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, or distributor may sell or offer for sale in this state any new recreational water vessel manufactured on or after January 1, 2026, with antifouling paint containing more than 0.5 percent copper. This restriction does not apply to wood boats.

   b. Beginning January 1, 2026, antifouling paint that is intended for use on a recreational water vessel and that contains more than 0.5 percent copper may not be offered for sale in this state.

   c. Beginning January 1, 2026, antifouling paint containing more than 0.5 percent copper may not be applied to a recreational water vessel in this state. This restriction does not apply to wood boats.

4. If the department does not determine by June 30, 2024, that safer and effective alternatives to copper-based antifouling paints are feasible, reasonable, and readily available, then the department must conduct a second review of relevant studies and information on alternatives to copper-based antifouling paints and submit a report to the legislature summarizing its findings no later than June 30, 2029.

5. Nothing in this section restricts the department from reviewing and restricting antifouling paints under chapter 70A.350 RCW.
