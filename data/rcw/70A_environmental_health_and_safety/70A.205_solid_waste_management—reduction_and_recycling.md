## 70A.205.005 - Legislative finding—Priorities—Goals.
The legislature finds:

1. Continuing technological changes in methods of manufacture, packaging, and marketing of consumer products, together with the economic and population growth of this state, the rising affluence of its citizens, and its expanding industrial activity have created new and ever-mounting problems involving disposal of garbage, refuse, and solid waste materials resulting from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities.

2. Traditional methods of disposing of solid wastes in this state are no longer adequate to meet the ever-increasing problem. Improper methods and practices of handling and disposal of solid wastes pollute our land, air and water resources, blight our countryside, adversely affect land values, and damage the overall quality of our environment.

3. Considerations of natural resource limitations, energy shortages, economics and the environment make necessary the development and implementation of solid waste recovery and/or recycling plans and programs.

4. Waste reduction must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. It is therefore necessary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility.

5. Source separation of waste must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. Collection and handling strategies should have, as an ultimate goal, the source separation of all materials with resource value or environmental hazard.

6. [Empty]

   a. It should be the goal of every person and business to minimize their production of wastes and to separate recyclable or hazardous materials from mixed waste.

   b. It is the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to provide for a waste management infrastructure to fully implement waste reduction and source separation strategies and to process and dispose of remaining wastes in a manner that is environmentally safe and economically sound. It is further the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to monitor the cost-effectiveness and environmental safety of combusting separated waste, processing mixed municipal solid waste, and recycling programs.

   c. It is the responsibility of county and city governments to assume primary responsibility for solid waste management and to develop and implement aggressive and effective waste reduction and source separation strategies.

   d. It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportunities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresidential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibility to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility.

7. Environmental and economic considerations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation.

8. The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable:

   a. Waste reduction;

   b. Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method;

   c. Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separated waste;

   d. Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of mixed municipal solid wastes.

9. It is the state's goal to achieve a fifty percent recycling rate by 2007.

10. It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.

11. Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.

12. It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.

13. Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.

14. Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.

15. Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.

16. All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable.

17. To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification.

18. It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented.

19. The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals. Market development must be encouraged on a state, regional, and national basis to maximize its effectiveness. The state shall assume primary responsibility for the development of a multifaceted market development program to carry out the purposes of chapter 431, Laws of 1989.

20. There is an imperative need to anticipate, plan for, and accomplish effective storage, control, recovery, and recycling of discarded tires and other problem wastes with the subsequent conservation of resources and energy.

## 70A.205.007 - Landfill disposal of organic materials—Goal.
1. [Empty]

   a. The state establishes a goal for the landfill disposal of organic materials at a level representing a 75 percent reduction by 2030 in the statewide disposal of organic material waste, relative to 2015 levels.

   b. The state establishes a goal that no less than 20 percent of the volume of edible food that was disposed of as of 2015 be recovered for human consumption by 2025.

2. The provisions of subsection (1) of this section are in addition to the food waste reduction goals of RCW 70A.205.715(1).

\[ [2022 c 180 § 101](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1799-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%20180%20§%20101); \]

## 70A.205.010 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive statewide program for solid waste handling, and solid waste recovery and/or recycling which will prevent land, air, and water pollution and conserve the natural, economic, and energy resources of this state. To this end it is the purpose of this chapter:

1. To assign primary responsibility for adequate solid waste handling to local government, reserving to the state, however, those functions necessary to assure effective programs throughout the state;

2. To provide for adequate planning for solid waste handling by local government;

3. To provide for the adoption and enforcement of basic minimum performance standards for solid waste handling, including that all sites where recyclable materials are generated and transported from shall provide a separate container for solid waste;

4. To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling, to promote consistency in the requirements for such facilities throughout the state, and to ensure that recyclable materials diverted from the waste stream for recycling are routed to facilities in which recycling occurs;

5. To provide technical and financial assistance to local governments in the planning, development, and conduct of solid waste handling programs;

6. To encourage storage, proper disposal, and recycling of discarded vehicle tires and to stimulate private recycling programs throughout the state; and

## 70A.205.170 - Waste generated outside the state—Findings.
The legislature finds that:

1. The state of Washington has responded to the increasing challenges of safe, affordable disposal of solid waste by an ambitious program of waste reduction, recycling and reuse, as well as strict standards to ensure the safe handling, transportation, and disposal of solid waste;

2. All communities in Washington participate in these programs through locally available recycling services, increased source separation and material recovery requirements, programs for waste reduction and product reuse, and performance standards that apply to all solid waste disposal facilities in the state;

3. New requirements for the siting and performance of disposal facilities have greatly decreased the number of such facilities in Washington, and the state has a significant interest in ensuring adequate disposal capacity within the state;

4. The landfilling, incineration, and other disposal of solid waste may adversely impact public health and environmental quality, and the state has a significant interest in decreasing volumes of the waste stream destined for disposal;

5. Because of the decreasing number of disposal facilities and other reasons, solid waste is being transported greater distances, often beyond the community where generated and is increasingly being transported between states;

6. Washington's waste management priorities and programs are a balanced approach of increased reuse, recycling and waste reduction, the strengthening of markets for recycled content products, and the safe disposal of the remaining waste stream, with the costs of these programs shared equitably by all persons generating waste in the state;

7. Those residing in other states who generate waste destined for disposal within Washington should also share the costs of waste diversion and management of Washington's disposal facilities, so that the risks of waste disposal and the costs of mitigating those risks are shared equitably by all waste generators, regardless of their location;

8. Because Washington state may not directly regulate waste handling, reduction, and recycling activities beyond its state boundaries, the only reasonable alternative to ensure this equitable treatment of waste being disposed within Washington is to implement a program of reviewing such activities as to waste originating outside of Washington, and to assign the additional costs, when necessary, to ensure that the waste meets standards substantially equivalent to those applicable to waste generated within the state, and, in some cases, to prohibit disposal of waste where its generation and management is not subject to standards substantially equivalent to those applicable to waste generated within the state.

## 70A.205.175 - Waste generated outside the state—Solid waste disposal site facility reporting requirements—Fees.
1. At least sixty days prior to receiving solid waste generated from outside of the state, the operator of a solid waste disposal site facility shall report to the department the types and quantities of waste to be received from an out-of-state source. The department shall develop guidelines for reporting this information. The guidelines shall provide for less than sixty days notice for shipments of waste made on a short-term or emergency basis. The requirements of this subsection shall take effect upon completion of the guidelines.

2. Upon notice under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall identify all activities and costs necessary to ensure that solid waste generated out-of-state meets standards relating to solid waste reduction, recycling, and management substantially equivalent to those required of solid waste generated within the state. The department may assess a fee on the out-of-state waste sufficient to recover the actual costs incurred in ensuring that the out-of-state waste meets equivalent state standards. The department may delegate, to a local health department, authority to implement the activities identified by the department under this subsection. All money received from fees imposed under this subsection shall be deposited into the account used to fund the activities required by this section, and shall be used solely for the activities required by this section.

3. The department may prohibit in-state disposal of solid waste generated from outside of the state, unless the generators of the waste meet: (a) Waste reduction and recycling requirements substantially equivalent to those applicable in Washington state; and (b) solid waste handling standards substantially equivalent to those applicable in Washington state.

4. The department may adopt rules to implement this section.

## 70A.205.715 - Food waste reduction—Goal—Plan—Definitions.
1. A goal is established for the state to reduce by fifty percent the amount of food waste generated annually by 2030, relative to 2015 levels. A subset of this goal must include a prevention goal to reduce the amount of edible food that is wasted.

2. The department may estimate 2015 levels of wasted food in Washington using any combination of solid waste reporting data obtained under this chapter and surveys and studies measuring wasted food and food waste in other jurisdictions. For the purposes of measuring progress towards the goal in subsection (1) of this section, the department must adopt standardized metrics and processes for measuring or estimating volumes of wasted food and food waste generated in the state.

3. By October 1, 2020, the department, in consultation with the department of agriculture and the department of health, must develop and adopt a state wasted food reduction and food waste diversion plan designed to achieve the goal established in subsection (1) of this section.

   a. The wasted food reduction and food waste diversion plan must include strategies, in descending order of priority, to:

      i. Prevent and reduce the wasting of edible food by residents and businesses;

      ii. Help match and support the capacity for edible food that would otherwise be wasted with food banks and other distributors that will ensure the food reaches those who need it; and

      iii. Support productive uses of inedible food materials, including using it for animal feed, energy production through anaerobic digestion, or other commercial uses, and for off-site or on-site management systems including composting, vermicomposting, or other biological systems.

   b. The wasted food reduction and food waste diversion plan must be designed to:

      i. Recommend a regulatory environment that optimizes activities and processes to rescue safe, nutritious, edible food;

      ii. Recommend a funding environment in which stable, predictable resources are provided to wasted food prevention and rescue and food waste recovery activities in such a way as to allow the development of additional capacity and the use of new technologies;

      iii. Avoid placing burdensome regulations on the hunger relief system, and ensure that organizations involved in wasted food prevention and rescue, and food waste recovery, retain discretion to accept or reject donations of food when appropriate;

      iv. Provide state technical support to wasted food prevention and rescue and food waste recovery organizations;

      v. Support the development and distribution of equitable materials to support food waste and wasted food educational and programmatic efforts in K-12 schools, in collaboration with the office of the superintendent of public instruction, and aligned with the Washington state science and social studies learning standards; and

      vi. Facilitate and encourage restaurants and other retail food establishments to safely donate food to food banks and food assistance programs through education and outreach to retail food establishment operators regarding safe food donation opportunities, practices, and benefits.

   c. The wasted food reduction and food waste diversion plan must include suggested best practices that local governments may incorporate into solid waste management plans developed under RCW 70A.205.040.

   d. The department must solicit feedback from the public and interested stakeholders throughout the process of developing and adopting the wasted food reduction and food waste diversion plan. To assist with its food waste reduction plan development responsibilities, the department may designate a stakeholder advisory panel. If the department designates a stakeholder advisory panel, it must consist of local government health departments, local government solid waste departments, food banks, hunger-focused nonprofit organizations, waste-focused nonprofit organizations, K-12 public education, and food businesses or food business associations.

   e. The department must identify the sources of scientific, economic, or other technical information it relied upon in developing the plan required under this section, including peer-reviewed science.

   f. In conjunction with the development of the wasted food reduction and food waste diversion plan, the department and the departments of agriculture and health must consider recommending changes to state law, including changes to food quality, labeling, and inspection requirements under chapter 69.80 RCW and any changes in laws relating to the donation of food waste or wasted food for animals, in order to achieve the goal established in subsection (1) of this section. Any such recommendations must be explained via a report to the legislature submitted consistent with RCW 43.01.036 by December 1, 2020. Prior to any implementation of the plan, for the activities, programs, or policies in the plan that would impose new obligations on state agencies, local governments, businesses, or citizens, the December 1, 2020, report must outline the plan for making regulatory changes identified in the report. This outline must include the department or the appropriate state agency's plan to make recommendations for statutory or administrative rule changes identified. In combination with any identified statutory or administrative rule changes, the department or the appropriate state agency must include expected cost estimates for both government entities and private persons or businesses to comply with any recommended changes.

4. In support of the development of the plan in subsection (3) of this section, the department of commerce must contract for an independent evaluation of the state's food waste and wasted food management system.

5. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
