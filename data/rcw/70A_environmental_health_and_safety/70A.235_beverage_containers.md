## 70A.235.010 - Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that beverage containers designed to be opened through the use of detachable metal rings or tabs are hazardous to the health and welfare of the citizens of this state and detrimental to certain wildlife. The detachable parts are susceptible to ingestion by human beings and wildlife. The legislature intends to eliminate the danger posed by these unnecessary containers by prohibiting their retail sale in this state.
