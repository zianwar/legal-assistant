## 70A.228.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds and declares that:

1. It is a matter of statewide concern that biomedical waste be handled in a manner that protects the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the environment, and the workers who handle the waste.

2. Infectious disease transmission has not been identified from improperly disposed biomedical waste, but the potential for such transmission may be present.

3. A uniform, statewide definition of biomedical waste will simplify compliance with local regulations while preserving local control of biomedical waste management.

## 70A.228.010 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Biomedical waste" means, and is limited to, the following types of waste:

   a. "Animal waste" is waste animal carcasses, body parts, and bedding of animals that are known to be infected with, or that have been inoculated with, human pathogenic microorganisms infectious to humans.

   b. "Biosafety level 4 disease waste" is waste contaminated with blood, excretions, exudates, or secretions from humans or animals who are isolated to protect others from highly communicable infectious diseases that are identified as pathogenic organisms assigned to biosafety level 4 by the centers for disease control, national institute of health, biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories, current edition.

   c. "Cultures and stocks" are wastes infectious to humans and includes specimen cultures, cultures and stocks of etiologic agents, wastes from production of biologicals and serums, discarded live and attenuated vaccines, and laboratory waste that has come into contact with cultures and stocks of etiologic agents or blood specimens. Such waste includes but is not limited to culture dishes, blood specimen tubes, and devices used to transfer, inoculate, and mix cultures.

   d. "Human blood and blood products" is discarded waste human blood and blood components, and materials containing free-flowing blood and blood products.

   e. "Pathological waste" is waste human source biopsy materials, tissues, and anatomical parts that emanate from surgery, obstetrical procedures, and autopsy. "Pathological waste" does not include teeth, human corpses, remains, and anatomical parts that are intended for final disposition.

   f. "Sharps waste" is all hypodermic needles, syringes with needles attached, IV tubing with needles attached, scalpel blades, and lancets that have been removed from the original sterile package.

2. "Local government" means city, town, or county.

3. "Local health department" means the city, county, city-county, or district public health department.

4. "Person" means an individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, joint venture, commercial entity, state government agency, or local government.

5. "Treatment" means incineration, sterilization, or other method, technique, or process that changes the character or composition of a biomedical waste so as to minimize the risk of transmitting an infectious disease.

6. "Residential sharps waste" has the same meaning as "sharps waste" in subsection (1) of this section except that the sharps waste is generated and prepared for disposal at a residence, apartment, dwelling, or other noncommercial habitat.

7. "Sharps waste container" means a leak-proof, rigid, puncture-resistant red container that is taped closed or tightly lidded to prevent the loss of the residential sharps waste.

8. "Mail programs" means those programs that provide sharps users with a multiple barrier protection kit for the placement of a sharps container and subsequent mailing of the wastes to an approved disposal facility.

9. "Pharmacy return programs" means those programs where sharps containers are returned by the user to designated return sites located at a pharmacy to be transported by a biomedical or solid waste collection company approved by the utilities and transportation commission.

10. "Drop-off programs" means those program sites designated by the solid waste planning jurisdiction where sharps users may dispose of their sharps containers.

11. "Source separation" has the same meaning as in RCW 70A.205.015.

12. "Unprotected sharps" means residential sharps waste that are not disposed of in a sharps waste container.

## 70A.228.020 - State definition preempts local definitions.
The definition of biomedical waste set forth in RCW 70A.228.010 shall be the sole state definition for biomedical waste within the state, and shall preempt biomedical waste definitions established by a local health department or local government.

\[ [2020 c 20 § 1242](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2246-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%2020%20§%201242); [1992 c 14 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2391-S.SL.pdf?cite=1992%20c%2014%20§%203); \]

## 70A.228.030 - Waste treatment technologies.
1. At the request of an applicant, the department of health, in consultation with the department of ecology and local health departments, may evaluate the environmental and public health impacts of biomedical waste treatment technologies. The department shall make available the results of any evaluation to local health departments.
