## 70A.105.010 - Legislative declaration.
The legislature finds that over one million, two hundred thousand persons in the state are not served by sanitary sewers and that they must rely on septic tank systems. The failure of large numbers of such systems has resulted in significant health hazards, loss of property values, and water quality degradation. The legislature further finds that failure of such systems could be reduced by utilization of nonwater-carried sewage disposal systems, or other alternative methods of effluent disposal, as a correctional measure. Wastewater volume diminution and disposal of most of the high bacterial waste through composting or other alternative methods of effluent disposal would result in restorative improvement or correction of existing substandard systems.

## 70A.105.020 - Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the terms defined in this section shall have the meanings indicated unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

1. "Nonwater-carried sewage disposal devices" means any device that stores and treats nonwater-carried human urine and feces.

2. "Alternative methods of effluent disposal" means systems approved by the department of health, including at least, mound systems, alternating drainfields, anaerobic filters, evapotranspiration systems, and aerobic systems.

3. "Failure" means: (a) Effluent has been discharged on the surface of the ground prior to approved treatment; or (b) effluent has percolated to the surface of the ground; or (c) effluent has contaminated or threatens to contaminate a groundwater supply.

4. "Additive" means any commercial product intended to affect the performance or aesthetics of an on-site sewage disposal system.

5. "Department" means the department of health.

6. "On-site sewage disposal system" means any system of piping, treatment devices, or other facilities that convey, store, treat, or dispose of sewage on the property where it originates or on nearby property under the control of the user where the system is not connected to a public sewer system. For purposes of this chapter, an on-site sewage disposal system does not include indoor plumbing and associated fixtures.

7. "Chemical additive" means those additives containing acids, bases, or other chemicals deemed unsafe by the department for use in an on-site sewage disposal system.

## 70A.105.030 - Local boards of health—Administrative search warrant—Administrative plan—Corrections.
1. Local boards of health shall identify failing septic tank drainfield systems in the normal manner and will use reasonable effort to determine new failures. The local health officer, environmental health director, or equivalent officer may apply for an administrative search warrant to a court official authorized to issue a criminal search warrant. The warrant may only be applied for after the local health officer or the health officer's designee has requested inspection of the person's property under the specific administrative plan required in this section, and the person has refused the health officer or the health officer's designee access to the person's property. Timely notice must be given to any affected person that a warrant is being requested and that the person may be present at any court proceeding to consider the requested search warrant. The court official may issue the warrant upon probable cause. A request for a search warrant must show [that] the inspection, examination, test, or sampling is in response to pollution in commercial or recreational shellfish harvesting areas or pollution in fresh water. A specific administrative plan must be developed expressly in response to the pollution. The local health officer, environmental health director, or equivalent officer shall submit the plan to the court as part of the justification for the warrant, along with specific evidence showing that it is reasonable to believe pollution is coming from the septic system on the property to be accessed for inspection. The plan must include each of the following elements:

   a. The overall goal of the inspection;

   b. The location and identification by address of the properties being authorized for inspection;

   c. Requirements for giving the person owning the property and the person occupying the property if it is someone other than the owner, notice of the plan, its provisions, and times of any inspections;

   d. The survey procedures to be used in the inspection;

   e. The criteria that would be used to define an on-site sewage system failure; and

   f. The follow-up actions that would be pursued once an on-site sewage system failure has been identified and confirmed.

2. Discretionary judgment will be made in implementing corrections by specifying nonwater-carried sewage disposal devices or other alternative methods of treatment and effluent disposal as a measure of ameliorating existing substandard conditions. Local regulations shall be consistent with the intent and purposes stated in this section.

## 70A.105.040 - Local boards of health—Authority to waive sections of local plumbing and/or building codes.
With the advice of the secretary of the department of health, local boards of health are hereby authorized to waive applicable sections of local plumbing and/or building codes that might prohibit the use of an alternative method for correcting a failure.

\[ [1991 c 3 § 368](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1115.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%203%20§%20368); [1977 ex.s. c 133 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1977ex1c133.pdf?cite=1977%20ex.s.%20c%20133%20§%204); \]

## 70A.105.050 - Adoption of more restrictive standards.
If the legislative authority of a county or city finds that more restrictive standards than those contained in *section 2 of this act or those adopted by the state board of health for systems allowed under *section 2 of this act or limitations on expansion of a residence are necessary to ensure protection of the public health, attainment of state water quality standards, and the protection of shellfish and other public resources, the legislative authority may adopt ordinances or resolutions setting standards as they may find necessary for implementing their findings. The legislative authority may identify the geographic areas where it is necessary to implement the more restrictive standards. In addition, the legislative authority may adopt standards for the design, construction, maintenance, and monitoring of sewage disposal systems.

\[ [1989 c 349 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c349.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20349%20§%203); \]

7. The department may contract with private laboratories for the performance of any duties necessary to carry out the purpose of this section.

8. The attorney general or appropriate city or county prosecuting attorney is authorized to bring an appropriate action to enjoin any violation of the prohibition on the sale or distribution of additives, or to enjoin any violation of the conditions in RCW 70A.105.080.

9. The department is responsible for providing written notification to additives manufacturers of the provisions of this section and RCW 70A.105.070 and 70A.105.080.
