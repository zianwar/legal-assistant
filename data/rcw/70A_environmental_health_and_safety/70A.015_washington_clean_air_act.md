## 70A.15.1005 - Declaration of public policies and purpose.
It is declared to be the public policy to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality for current and future generations. Air is an essential resource that must be protected from harmful levels of pollution. Improving air quality is a matter of statewide concern and is in the public interest. It is the intent of this chapter to secure and maintain levels of air quality that protect human health and safety, including the most sensitive members of the population, to comply with the requirements of the federal clean air act, to prevent injury to plant, animal life, and property, to foster the comfort and convenience of Washington's inhabitants, to promote the economic and social development of the state, and to facilitate the enjoyment of the natural attractions of the state.

It is further the intent of this chapter to protect the public welfare, to preserve visibility, to protect scenic, aesthetic, historic, and cultural values, and to prevent air pollution problems that interfere with the enjoyment of life, property, or natural attractions.

Because of the extent of the air pollution problem the legislature finds it necessary to return areas with poor air quality to levels adequate to protect health and the environment as expeditiously as possible but no later than December 31, 1995. Further, it is the intent of this chapter to prevent any areas of the state with acceptable air quality from reaching air contaminant levels that are not protective of human health and the environment.

The legislature recognizes that air pollution control projects may affect other environmental media. In selecting air pollution control strategies state and local agencies shall support those strategies that lessen the negative environmental impact of the project on all environmental media, including air, water, and land.

The legislature further recognizes that energy efficiency and energy conservation can help to reduce air pollution and shall therefore be considered when making decisions on air pollution control strategies and projects.

It is the policy of the state that the costs of protecting the air resource and operating state and local air pollution control programs shall be shared as equitably as possible among all sources whose emissions cause air pollution.

It is also declared as public policy that regional air pollution control programs are to be encouraged and supported to the extent practicable as essential instruments for the securing and maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality.

To these ends it is the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the public interest through an intensive, progressive, and coordinated statewide program of air pollution prevention and control, to provide for an appropriate distribution of responsibilities, and to encourage coordination and cooperation between the state, regional, and local units of government, to improve cooperation between state and federal government, public and private organizations, and the concerned individual, as well as to provide for the use of all known, available, and reasonable methods to reduce, prevent, and control air pollution.

The legislature recognizes that the problems and effects of air pollution cross political boundaries, are frequently regional or interjurisdictional in nature, and are dependent upon the existence of human activity in areas having common topography and weather conditions conducive to the buildup of air contaminants. In addition, the legislature recognizes that air pollution levels are aggravated and compounded by increased population, and its consequences. These changes often result in increasingly serious problems for the public and the environment.

The legislature further recognizes that air emissions from thousands of small individual sources are major contributors to air pollution in many regions of the state. As the population of a region grows, small sources may contribute an increasing proportion of that region's total air emissions. It is declared to be the policy of the state to achieve significant reductions in emissions from those small sources whose aggregate emissions constitute a significant contribution to air pollution in a particular region.

It is the intent of the legislature that air pollution goals be incorporated in the missions and actions of state agencies.

## 70A.15.1030 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Air contaminant" means dust, fumes, mist, smoke, other particulate matter, vapor, gas, odorous substance, or any combination thereof.

2. "Air pollution" is presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more air contaminants in sufficient quantities and of such characteristics and duration as is, or is likely to be, injurious to human health, plant or animal life, or property, or which unreasonably interfere with enjoyment of life and property. For the purpose of this chapter, air pollution shall not include air contaminants emitted in compliance with chapter 17.21 RCW.

3. "Air quality standard" means an established concentration, exposure time, and frequency of occurrence of an air contaminant or multiple contaminants in the ambient air which shall not be exceeded.

4. "Ambient air" means the surrounding outside air.

5. "Authority" means any air pollution control agency whose jurisdictional boundaries are coextensive with the boundaries of one or more counties.

6. "Best available control technology" (BACT) means an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction for each air pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter emitted from or that results from any new or modified stationary source, that the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such a source or modification through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning, clean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of each such a pollutant. In no event shall application of "best available control technology" result in emissions of any pollutants that will exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 C.F.R. Part 60 and Part 61, as they exist on July 25, 1993, or their later enactments as adopted by reference by the director by rule. Emissions from any source utilizing clean fuels, or any other means, to comply with this subsection shall not be allowed to increase above levels that would have been required under the definition of BACT as it existed prior to enactment of the federal clean air act amendments of 1990.

7. "Best available retrofit technology" (BART) means an emission limitation based on the degree of reduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction for each pollutant that is emitted by an existing stationary facility. The emission limitation must be established, on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the technology available, the costs of compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, any pollution control equipment in use or in existence at the source, the remaining useful life of the source, and the degree of improvement in visibility that might reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of the technology.

8. "Board" means the board of directors of an authority.

9. "Control officer" means the air pollution control officer of any authority.

10. "Department" or "ecology" means the department of ecology.

11. "Emission" means a release of air contaminants into the ambient air.

12. "Emission standard" and "emission limitation" mean a requirement established under the federal clean air act or this chapter that limits the quantity, rate, or concentration of emissions of air contaminants on a continuous basis, including any requirement relating to the operation or maintenance of a source to assure continuous emission reduction, and any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard adopted under the federal clean air act or this chapter.

13. "Fine particulate" means particulates with a diameter of two and one-half microns and smaller.

14. "Lowest achievable emission rate" (LAER) means for any source that rate of emissions that reflects:

    a. The most stringent emission limitation that is contained in the implementation plan of any state for such class or category of source, unless the owner or operator of the proposed source demonstrates that such limitations are not achievable; or

    b. The most stringent emission limitation that is achieved in practice by such class or category of source, whichever is more stringent.

In no event shall the application of this term permit a proposed new or modified source to emit any pollutant in excess of the amount allowable under applicable new source performance standards.

15. "Modification" means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source that increases the amount of any air contaminant emitted by such source or that results in the emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted. The term modification shall be construed consistent with the definition of modification in Section 7411, Title 42, United States Code, and with rules implementing that section.

16. "Multicounty authority" means an authority which consists of two or more counties.

17. "New source" means (a) the construction or modification of a stationary source that increases the amount of any air contaminant emitted by such source or that results in the emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted, and (b) any other project that constitutes a new source under the federal clean air act.

18. "Permit program source" means a source required to apply for or to maintain an operating permit under RCW 70A.15.2260.

19. "Person" means an individual, firm, public or private corporation, association, partnership, political subdivision of the state, municipality, or governmental agency.

20. "Reasonably available control technology" (RACT) means the lowest emission limit that a particular source or source category is capable of meeting by the application of control technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility. RACT is determined on a case-by-case basis for an individual source or source category taking into account the impact of the source upon air quality, the availability of additional controls, the emission reduction to be achieved by additional controls, the impact of additional controls on air quality, and the capital and operating costs of the additional controls. RACT requirements for a source or source category shall be adopted only after notice and opportunity for comment are afforded.

21. "Silvicultural burning" means burning of wood fiber on forestland consistent with the provisions of RCW 70A.15.5120.

22. "Source" means all of the emissions units including quantifiable fugitive emissions, that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person, or persons under common control, whose activities are ancillary to the production of a single product or functionally related group of products.

23. "Stationary source" means any building, structure, facility, or installation that emits or may emit any air contaminant.

24. "Trigger level" means the ambient level of fine particulates, measured in micrograms per cubic meter, that must be detected prior to initiating a first or second stage of impaired air quality under RCW 70A.15.3580.

## 70A.15.1570 - Cost-reimbursement agreements.
1. An authority may enter into a written cost-reimbursement agreement with a permit applicant or project proponent to recover from the applicant or proponent the reasonable costs incurred by the authority in carrying out the requirements of this chapter, as well as the requirements of other relevant laws, as they relate to permit coordination, environmental review, application review, technical studies, and permit processing.

2. The cost-reimbursement agreement shall identify the tasks and costs for work to be conducted under the agreement. The agreement must include a schedule that states:

   a. The estimated number of weeks for initial review of the permit application;

   b. The estimated number of revision cycles;

   c. The estimated number of weeks for review of subsequent revision submittals;

   d. The estimated number of billable hours of employee time;

   e. The rate per hour; and

   f. A date for revision of the agreement if necessary.

3. The written cost-reimbursement agreement shall be negotiated with the permit applicant or project proponent. Under the provisions of a cost-reimbursement agreement, funds from the applicant or proponent shall be used by the air pollution control authority to contract with an independent consultant to carry out the work covered by the cost-reimbursement agreement. The air pollution control authority may also use funds provided under a cost-reimbursement agreement to hire temporary employees, to assign current staff to review the work of the consultant, to provide necessary technical assistance when an independent consultant with comparable technical skills is unavailable, and to recover reasonable and necessary direct and indirect costs that arise from processing the permit. The air pollution control authority shall, in developing the agreement, ensure that final decisions that involve policy matters are made by the agency and not by the consultant. The air pollution control authority shall make an estimate of the number of permanent staff hours to process the permits, and shall contract with consultants or hire temporary employees to replace the time and functions committed by these permanent staff to the project. The billing process shall provide for accurate time and cost accounting and may include a billing cycle that provides for progress payments. 

4. The cost-reimbursement agreement must not negatively impact the processing of other permit applications. In order to maintain permit processing capacity, the agency may hire outside consultants, temporary employees, or make internal administrative changes. Consultants or temporary employees hired as part of a cost-reimbursement agreement or to maintain agency capacity are hired as agents of the state not of the permit applicant. The provisions of chapter 42.52 RCW apply to any cost-reimbursement agreement, and to any person hired as a result of a cost-reimbursement agreement. Members of the air pollution control authority's board of directors shall be considered as state officers, and employees of the air pollution control authority shall be considered as state employees, for the sole purpose of applying the restrictions of chapter 42.52 RCW to this section.

## 70A.15.2210 - Notice may be required of construction of proposed new contaminant source—Submission of plans—Approval, disapproval—Emission control—"De minimis new sources" defined.
1. The department of ecology or board of any authority may require notice of the establishment of any proposed new sources except single-family and duplex dwellings or de minimis new sources as defined in rules adopted under subsection (11) of this section. The department of ecology or board may require such notice to be accompanied by a fee and determine the amount of such fee: PROVIDED, That the amount of the fee may not exceed the cost of reviewing the plans, specifications, and other information and administering such notice: PROVIDED FURTHER, That any such notice given or notice of construction application submitted to either the board or to the department of ecology shall preclude a further submittal of a duplicate application to any board or to the department of ecology.

2. The department shall, after opportunity for public review and comment, adopt rules that establish a workload-driven process for determination and review of the fee covering the direct and indirect costs of processing a notice of construction application and a methodology for tracking revenues and expenditures. All new source fees collected by the delegated local air authorities from sources shall be deposited in the dedicated accounts of their respective treasuries. All new source fees collected by the department from sources shall be deposited in the air pollution control account.

3. Within thirty days of receipt of a notice of construction application, the department of ecology or board may require, as a condition precedent to the establishment of the new source or sources covered thereby, the submission of plans, specifications, and such other information as it deems necessary to determine whether the proposed new source will be in accord with applicable rules and regulations in force under this chapter. If on the basis of plans, specifications, or other information required under this section the department of ecology or board determines that the proposed new source will not be in accord with this chapter or the applicable ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations adopted under this chapter, it shall issue an order denying permission to establish the new source. If on the basis of plans, specifications, or other information required under this section, the department of ecology or board determines that the proposed new source will be in accord with this chapter, and the applicable rules and regulations adopted under this chapter, it shall issue an order of approval for the establishment of the new source or sources, which order may provide such conditions as are reasonably necessary to assure the maintenance of compliance with this chapter and the applicable rules and regulations adopted under this chapter. Every order of approval under this chapter must be reviewed prior to issuance by a professional engineer or staff under the supervision of a professional engineer in the employ of the department of ecology or board.

4. The determination required under subsection (3) of this section shall include a determination of whether the operation of the new air contaminant source at the location proposed will cause any ambient air quality standard to be exceeded.

5. New source review of a modification shall be limited to the emission unit or units proposed to be modified and the air contaminants whose emissions would increase as a result of the modification.

6. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the department of ecology or board to require the use of emission control equipment or other equipment, machinery, or devices of any particular type, from any particular supplier, or produced by any particular manufacturer.

7. Any features, machines, and devices constituting parts of or called for by plans, specifications, or other information submitted pursuant to subsection (1) or (3) of this section shall be maintained and operate in good working order.

8. The absence of an ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation, or the failure to issue an order pursuant to this section shall not relieve any person from his or her obligation to comply with applicable emission control requirements or with any other provision of law.

9. Within thirty days of receipt of a notice of construction application the department of ecology or board shall either notify the applicant in writing that the application is complete or notify the applicant in writing of all additional information necessary to complete the application. Within sixty days of receipt of a complete application the department or board shall either (a) issue a final decision on the application, or (b) for those projects subject to public notice, initiate notice and comment on a proposed decision, followed as promptly as possible by a final decision. A person seeking approval to construct or modify a source that requires an operating permit may elect to integrate review of the operating permit application or amendment required by RCW 70A.15.2260 and the notice of construction application required by this section. A notice of construction application designated for integrated review shall be processed in accordance with operating permit program procedures and deadlines.

10. A notice of construction approval required under subsection (3) of this section shall include a determination that the new source will achieve best available control technology. If more stringent controls are required under federal law, the notice of construction shall include a determination that the new source will achieve the more stringent federal requirements. Nothing in this subsection is intended to diminish other state authorities under this chapter.

11. No person is required to submit a notice of construction or receive approval for a new source that is deemed by the department of ecology or board to have de minimis impact on air quality. The department of ecology shall adopt and periodically update rules identifying categories of de minimis new sources. The department of ecology may identify de minimis new sources by category, size, or emission thresholds.

12. For purposes of this section, "de minimis new sources" means new sources with trivial levels of emissions that do not pose a threat to human health or the environment.

## 70A.15.2230 - RACT requirements.
1. RACT as defined in RCW 70A.15.1030 is required for existing sources except as otherwise provided in RCW 70A.15.3000(9).

2. RACT for each source category containing three or more sources shall be determined by rule except as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

3. Source-specific RACT determinations may be performed under any of the following circumstances:

   a. As authorized by RCW 70A.15.2220;

   b. When required by the federal clean air act;

   c. For sources in source categories containing fewer than three sources;

   d. When an air quality problem, for which the source is a contributor, justifies a source-specific RACT determination prior to development of a categorical RACT rule; or

   e. When a source-specific RACT determination is needed to address either specific air quality problems for which the source is a significant contributor or source-specific economic concerns.

4. By January 1, 1994, ecology shall develop a list of sources and source categories requiring RACT review and a schedule for conducting that review. Ecology shall review the list and schedule within six months of receiving the initial operating permit applications and at least once every five years thereafter. In developing the list to determine the schedule of RACT review, ecology shall consider emission reductions achievable through the use of new available technologies and the impacts of those incremental reductions on air quality, the remaining useful life of previously installed control equipment, the impact of the source or source category on air quality, the number of years since the last BACT, RACT, or LAER determination for that source and other relevant factors. Prior to finalizing the list and schedule, ecology shall consult with local air authorities, the regulated community, environmental groups, and other interested individuals and organizations. The department and local authorities shall revise RACT requirements, as needed, based on the review conducted under this subsection.

5. In determining RACT, ecology and local authorities shall utilize the factors set forth in RCW 70A.15.1030 and shall consider RACT determinations and guidance made by the federal environmental protection agency, other states and local authorities for similar sources, and other relevant factors. In establishing or revising RACT requirements, ecology and local authorities shall address, where practicable, all air contaminants deemed to be of concern for that source or source category.

6. Emission standards and other requirements contained in rules or regulatory orders in effect at the time of operating permit issuance or renewal shall be considered RACT for purposes of permit issuance or renewal. RACT determinations under subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall be incorporated into operating permits as provided in RCW 70A.15.2260 and rules implementing that section.

7. The department and local air authorities are authorized to assess and collect a fee to cover the costs of developing, establishing, or reviewing categorical or case-by-case RACT requirements. The fee shall apply to determinations of RACT requirements as defined under this section and RCW 70A.15.3000(9). The amount of the fee may not exceed the direct and indirect costs of establishing the requirement for the particular source or the pro rata portion of the direct and indirect costs of establishing the requirement for the relevant source category. The department shall, after opportunity for public review and comment, adopt rules that establish a workload-driven process for determination and review of the fee covering the direct and indirect costs of its RACT determinations and a methodology for tracking revenues and expenditures. All such RACT determination fees collected by the delegated local air authorities from sources shall be deposited in the dedicated accounts of their respective treasuries. All such RACT fees collected by the department from sources shall be deposited in the air pollution control account.

## 70A.15.2240 - Control of emissions—Bubble concept—Schedules of compliance.
1. As used in subsection (3) of this section, the term "bubble" means an air pollution control system which permits aggregate measurements of allowable emissions, for a single category of pollutant, for emissions points from a specified emissions-generating facility or facilities. Individual point source emissions levels from such specified facility or facilities may be modified provided that the aggregate limit for the specified sources is not exceeded.

2. Whenever any regulation relating to emission standards or other requirements for the control of emissions is adopted which provides for compliance with such standards or requirements no later than a specified time after the date of adoption of the regulation, the appropriate activated air pollution control authority or, if there be none, the department of ecology shall, by permit or regulatory order, issue to air contaminant sources subject to the standards or requirements, schedules of compliance setting forth timetables for the achievement of compliance as expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later than the time specified in the regulation. Interim dates in such schedules for the completion of steps of progress toward compliance shall be as enforceable as the final date for full compliance therein.

3. Wherever requirements necessary for the attainment of air quality standards or, where such standards are not exceeded, for the maintenance of air quality can be achieved through the use of a control program involving the bubble concept, such program may be authorized by a regulatory order or orders or permit issued to the air contaminant source or sources involved. Such order or permit shall only be authorized after the control program involving the bubble concept is accepted by [the] United States environmental protection agency as part of an approved state implementation plan. Any such order or permit provision shall restrict total emissions within the bubble to no more than would otherwise be allowed in the aggregate for all emitting processes covered. The orders or permits provided for by this subsection shall be issued by the department or the authority with jurisdiction. If the bubble involves interjurisdictional approval, concurrence in the total program must be secured from each regulatory entity concerned.

## 70A.15.2260 - Operating permits for air contaminant sources—Generally—Fees, report to legislature.
The department of ecology, or board of an authority, shall require renewable permits for the operation of air contaminant sources subject to the following conditions and limitations:

1. Permits shall be issued for a term of five years. A permit may be modified or amended during its term at the request of the permittee, or for any reason allowed by the federal clean air act. The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall include rules for permit amendments and modifications. The terms and conditions of a permit shall remain in effect after the permit itself expires if the permittee submits a timely and complete application for permit renewal.

2. [Empty]

   a. Rules establishing the elements for a statewide operating permit program and the process for permit application and renewal consistent with federal requirements shall be established by the department by January 1, 1993. The rules shall provide that every proposed permit must be reviewed prior to issuance by a professional engineer or staff under the direct supervision of a professional engineer in the employ of the permitting authority. The permit program established by these rules shall be administered by the department and delegated local air authorities. Rules developed under this subsection shall not preclude a delegated local air authority from including in a permit its own more stringent emission standards and operating restrictions.

   b. The board of any local air pollution control authority may apply to the department of ecology for a delegation order authorizing the local authority to administer the operating permit program for sources under that authority's jurisdiction. The department shall, by order, approve such delegation, if the department finds that the local authority has the technical and financial resources, to discharge the responsibilities of a permitting authority under the federal clean air act. A delegation request shall include adequate information about the local authority's resources to enable the department to make the findings required by this subsection. However, any delegation order issued under this subsection shall take effect ninety days after the environmental protection agency authorizes the local authority to issue operating permits under the federal clean air act.

   c. Except for the authority granted the energy facility site evaluation council to issue permits for the new construction, reconstruction, or enlargement or operation of new energy facilities under chapter 80.50 RCW, the department may exercise the authority, as delegated by the environmental protection agency, to administer Title IV of the federal clean air act as amended and to delegate such administration to local authorities as applicable pursuant to (b) of this subsection.

3. In establishing technical standards, defined in RCW 70A.15.1030, the permitting authority shall consider and, if found to be appropriate, give credit for waste reduction within the process.

4. Operating permits shall apply to all sources (a) where required by the federal clean air act, and (b) for any source that may cause or contribute to air pollution in such quantity as to create a threat to the public health or welfare. Subsection (b) of this subsection is not intended to apply to small businesses except when both of the following limitations are satisfied: (i) The source is in an area exceeding or threatening to exceed federal or state air quality standards; and (ii) the department provides a reasonable justification that requiring a source to have a permit is necessary to meet a federal or state air quality standard, or to prevent exceeding a standard in an area threatening to exceed the standard. For purposes of this subsection "areas threatening to exceed air quality standards" shall mean areas projected by the department to exceed such standards within five years. Prior to identifying threatened areas the department shall hold a public hearing or hearings within the proposed areas.

5. Sources operated by government agencies are not exempt under this section.

6. Within one hundred eighty days after the United States environmental protection agency approves the state operating permit program, a person required to have a permit shall submit to the permitting authority a compliance plan and permit application, signed by a responsible official, certifying the accuracy of the information submitted. Until permits are issued, existing sources shall be allowed to operate under presently applicable standards and conditions provided that such sources submit complete and timely permit applications.

7. All draft permits shall be subject to public notice and comment. The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall specify procedures for public notice and comment. Such procedures shall provide the permitting agency with an opportunity to respond to comments received from interested parties prior to the time that the proposed permit is submitted to the environmental protection agency for review pursuant to section 505(a) of the federal clean air act. In the event that the environmental protection agency objects to a proposed permit pursuant to section 505(b) of the federal clean air act, the permitting authority shall not issue the permit, unless the permittee consents to the changes required by the environmental protection agency.

8. The procedures contained in chapter 43.21B RCW shall apply to permit appeals. The pollution control hearings board may stay the effectiveness of any permit issued under this section during the pendency of an appeal filed by the permittee, if the permittee demonstrates that compliance with the permit during the pendency of the appeal would require significant expenditures that would not be necessary in the event that the permittee prevailed on the merits of the appeal.

9. After the effective date of any permit program promulgated under this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to: (a) Operate a permitted source in violation of any requirement of a permit issued under this section; or (b) fail to submit a permit application at the time required by rules adopted under subsection (2) of this section.

10. Each air operating permit shall state the origin of and specific legal authority for each requirement included therein. Every requirement in an operating permit shall be based upon the most stringent of the following requirements:

    a. The federal clean air act and rules implementing that act, including provision of the approved state implementation plan;

    b. This chapter and rules adopted thereunder;

    c. In permits issued by a local air pollution control authority, the requirements of any order or regulation adopted by that authority;

    d. Chapter 70A.388 RCW and rules adopted thereunder; and

    e. Chapter 80.50 RCW and rules adopted thereunder.

11. Consistent with the provisions of the federal clean air act, the permitting authority may issue general permits covering categories of permitted sources, and temporary permits authorizing emissions from similar operations at multiple temporary locations.

12. Permit program sources within the territorial jurisdiction of an authority delegated the operating permit program shall file their permit applications with that authority, except that permit applications for sources regulated on a statewide basis pursuant to RCW 70A.15.3080 shall be filed with the department. Permit program sources outside the territorial jurisdiction of a delegated authority shall file their applications with the department. Permit program sources subject to chapter 80.50 RCW shall, irrespective of their location, file their applications with the energy facility site evaluation council.

13. When issuing operating permits to coal-fired electric generating plants, the permitting authority shall establish requirements consistent with Title IV of the federal clean air act.

14. [Empty]

    a. The department and the local air authorities are authorized to assess and to collect, and each source emitting one hundred tons or more per year of a regulated pollutant shall pay an interim assessment to fund the development of the operating permit program during fiscal year 1994.

    b. The department shall conduct a workload analysis and prepare an operating permit program development budget for fiscal year 1994. The department shall allocate among all sources emitting one hundred tons or more per year of a regulated pollutant during calendar year 1992 the costs identified in its program development budget according to a three-tiered model, with each of the three tiers being equally weighted, based upon:

       i. The number of sources;

       ii. The complexity of sources; and

       iii. The size of sources, as measured by the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted by the source.

    c. Each local authority and the department shall collect from sources under their respective jurisdictions the interim fee determined by the department and shall remit the fee to the department.

    d. Each local authority may, in addition, allocate its fiscal year 1994 operating permit program development costs among the sources under its jurisdiction emitting one hundred tons or more per year of a regulated pollutant during calendar year 1992 and may collect an interim fee from these sources. A fee assessed pursuant to this subsection (14)(d) shall be collected at the same time as the fee assessed pursuant to (c) of this subsection.

    e. The fees assessed to a source under this subsection shall be limited to the first seven thousand five hundred tons for each regulated pollutant per year.

15. [Empty]

    a. The department shall determine the persons liable for the fee imposed by subsection (14) of this section, compute the fee, and provide by November 1, 1993, the identity of the fee payer with the computation of the fee to each local authority and to the department of revenue for collection. The department of revenue shall collect the fee computed by the department from the fee payers under the jurisdiction of the department. The administrative, collection, and penalty provisions of chapter 82.32 RCW shall apply to the collection of the fee by the department of revenue. The department shall provide technical assistance to the department of revenue for decisions made by the department of revenue pursuant to RCW 82.32.160 and 82.32.170. All interim fees collected by the department of revenue on behalf of the department and all interim fees collected by local authorities on behalf of the department shall be deposited in the air operating permit account. The interim fees collected by the local air authorities to cover their permit program development costs under subsection (14)(d) of this section shall be deposited in the dedicated accounts of their respective treasuries.

    b. All fees identified in this section shall be due and payable on March 1, 1994, except that the local air pollution control authorities may adopt by rule an earlier date on which fees are to be due and payable. The section 5, chapter 252, Laws of 1993 amendments to RCW 70A.15.2260 do not have the effect of terminating, or in any way modifying, any liability, civil or criminal, incurred pursuant to the provisions of RCW 70A.15.2260 (15) and (17) as they existed prior to July 25, 1993.

16. For sources or source categories not required to obtain permits under subsection (4) of this section, the department or local authority may establish by rule control technology requirements. If control technology rule revisions are made by the department or local authority under this subsection, the department or local authority shall consider the remaining useful life of control equipment previously installed on existing sources before requiring technology changes. The department or any local air authority may issue a general permit, as authorized under the federal clean air act, for such sources.

## 70A.15.2270 - Annual fees from operating permit program source to cover cost of program.
1. The department and delegated local air authorities are authorized to determine, assess, and collect, and each permit program source shall pay, annual fees sufficient to cover the direct and indirect costs of implementing a state operating permit program approved by the United States environmental protection agency under the federal clean air act. However, a source that receives its operating permit from the United States environmental protection agency shall not be considered a permit program source so long as the environmental protection agency continues to act as the permitting authority for that source. Each permitting authority shall develop by rule a fee schedule allocating among its permit program sources the costs of the operating permit program, and may, by rule, establish a payment schedule whereby periodic installments of the annual fee are due and payable more frequently. All operating permit program fees collected by the department shall be deposited in the air operating permit account. All operating permit program fees collected by the delegated local air authorities shall be deposited in their respective air operating permit accounts or other accounts dedicated exclusively to support of the operating permit program. The fees assessed under this subsection shall first be due not less than forty-five days after the United States environmental protection agency delegates to the department the authority to administer the operating permit program and then annually thereafter.

The department shall establish, by rule, procedures for administrative appeals to the department regarding the fee assessed pursuant to this subsection.

2. The fee schedule developed by each permitting authority shall fully cover and not exceed both its permit administration costs and the permitting authority's share of statewide program development and oversight costs.

   a. Permit administration costs are those incurred by each permitting authority, including the department, in administering and enforcing the operating permit program with respect to sources under its jurisdiction. Costs associated with the following activities are fee eligible as these activities relate to the operating permit program and to the sources permitted by a permitting authority, including, where applicable, sources subject to a general permit:

      i. Preapplication assistance and review of an application and proposed compliance plan for a permit, permit revision, or renewal;

      xv. The share attributable to permitted sources of modeling activities;

      xvi. Provision of assistance to small business as required under section 507 of the federal clean air act as it exists on July 25, 1993, or its later enactment as adopted by reference by the director by rule;

      xvii. Provision of services by the department of revenue and the office of the state attorney general and other state agencies in support of permit program administration;

      xviii. A one-time revision to the state implementation plan to make those administrative changes necessary to ensure coordination of the state implementation plan and the operating permit program; and

      xix. Other activities required by operating permit regulations issued by the United States environmental protection agency under the federal clean air act.

3. The responsibility for operating permit fee determination, assessment, and collection is to be shared by the department and delegated local air authorities as follows:

   a. Each permitting authority, including the department, acting in its capacity as a permitting authority, shall develop a fee schedule and mechanism for collecting fees from the permit program sources under its jurisdiction; the fees collected by each authority shall be sufficient to cover its costs of permit administration and its share of the department's costs of development and oversight. Each delegated local authority shall remit to the department its share of the department's development and oversight costs.

   b. Only those local air authorities to whom the department has delegated the authority to administer the program pursuant to RCW 70A.15.2260(2) (b) and (c) and 70A.15.6240 shall have the authority to administer and collect operating permit fees. The department shall retain the authority to administer and collect such fees with respect to the sources within the jurisdiction of a local air authority until the effective date of program delegation to that air authority.

   c. The department shall allocate its development and oversight costs among all permitting authorities, including the department, in proportion to the number of permit program sources under the jurisdiction of each authority, except that extraordinary costs or other costs readily attributable to a specific permitting authority may be assessed that authority. For purposes of this subsection, all sources covered by a single general permit shall be treated as one source.

4. The department and each delegated local air authority shall adopt by rule a general permit fee schedule for sources under their respective jurisdictions after such time as the department adopts provisions for general permit issuance. Within ninety days of the time that the department adopts a general permit fee schedule, the department shall report to the relevant standing committees of the legislature regarding the general permit fee schedules adopted by the department and by the delegated local air authorities. The permit administration costs of each general permit shall be allocated equitably among only those sources subject to that general permit. The share of development and oversight costs attributable to each general permit shall be determined pursuant to subsection (3)(c) of this section.

5. The fee schedule developed by the department shall allocate among the sources for whom the department acts as a permitting authority, other than sources subject to a general permit, those portions of the department's permit administration costs and the department's share of the development and oversight costs which the department does not plan to recover under its general permit fee schedule or schedules as follows:

   a. The department shall allocate its permit administration costs and its share of the development and oversight costs not recovered through general permit fees according to a three-tiered model based upon:

      i. The number of permit program sources under its jurisdiction;

      ii. The complexity of permit program sources under its jurisdiction; and

      iii. The size of permit program sources under its jurisdiction, as measured by the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted by the source.

   b. Each of the three tiers shall be equally weighted.

   c. The department may, in addition, allocate activities-based costs readily attributable to a specific source to that source under RCW 70A.15.2210(1) and 70A.15.2230(7).

The quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted by a source shall be determined based on the annual emissions during the most recent calendar year for which data is available.

6. The department shall, after opportunity for public review and comment, adopt rules that establish a process for development and review of its operating permit program fee schedule, a methodology for tracking program revenues and expenditures, and, for both the department and the delegated local air authorities, a system of fiscal audits, reports, and periodic performance audits.

   a. The fee schedule development and review process shall include the following:

      i. The department shall conduct a biennial workload analysis. The department shall provide the opportunity for public review of and comment on the workload analysis. The department shall review and update its workload analysis during each biennial budget cycle, taking into account information gathered by tracking previous revenues, time, and expenditures and other information obtained through fiscal audits and performance audits.

      ii. The department shall prepare a biennial budget based upon the resource requirements identified in the workload analysis for that biennium. In preparing the budget, the department shall take into account the projected operating permit account balance at the start of the biennium. The department shall provide the opportunity for public review of and comment on the proposed budget. The department shall review and update its budget each biennium.

      iii. The department shall develop a fee schedule allocating the department's permit administration costs and its share of the development and oversight costs among the department's permit program sources using the methodology described in subsection (5) of this section. The department shall provide the opportunity for public review of and comment on the allocation methodology and fee schedule. The department shall provide procedures for administrative resolution of disputes regarding the source data on which allocation determinations are based; these procedures shall be designed such that resolution occurs prior to the completion of the allocation process. The department shall review and update its fee schedule annually.

   b. The methodology for tracking revenues and expenditures shall include the following:

      i. The department shall develop a system for tracking revenues and expenditures that provides the maximum practicable information. At a minimum, revenues from fees collected under the operating permit program shall be tracked on a source-specific basis and time and expenditures required to administer the program shall be tracked on the basis of source categories and functional categories. Each general permit will be treated as a separate source category for tracking and accounting purposes.

      ii. The department shall use the information obtained from tracking revenues, time, and expenditures to modify the workload analysis required in subsection (6)(a) of this section.

      iii. The information obtained from tracking revenues, time, and expenditures shall not provide a basis for challenge to the amount of an individual source's fee.

   c. The system of fiscal audits, reports, and periodic performance audits shall include the following:

      i. The department and the delegated local air authorities shall periodically report information about the air operating permit program on the department's website.

      ii. The department shall arrange for fiscal audits and routine performance audits and for periodic intensive performance audits of each permitting authority and of the department.

7. Each local air authority requesting delegation shall, after opportunity for public review and comment, publish regulations which establish a process for development and review of its operating permit program fee schedule, and a methodology for tracking its revenues and expenditures. These regulations shall be submitted to the department for review and approval as part of the local authority's delegation request.

8. As used in this section and in RCW 70A.15.2260(14), "regulated pollutant" shall have the same meaning as defined in section 502(b) of the federal clean air act as it exists on July 25, 1993, or its later enactment as adopted by reference by the director by rule.

9. Fee structures as authorized under this section shall remain in effect until such time as the legislature authorizes an alternative structure following receipt of the report required by this subsection.

## 70A.15.2310 - Variances—Application for—Considerations—Limitations—Renewals—Review.
1. Any person who owns or is in control of any plant, building, structure, establishment, process or equipment may apply to the department of ecology or appropriate local authority board for a variance from rules or regulations governing the quality, nature, duration or extent of discharges of air contaminants. The application shall be accompanied by such information and data as the department of ecology or board may require. The department of ecology or board may grant such variance, provided that variances to state rules shall require the department's approval prior to being issued by a local authority board. The total time period for a variance and renewal of such variance shall not exceed one year. Variances may be issued by either the department or a local board but only after public hearing or due notice, if the department or board finds that:

   a. The emissions occurring or proposed to occur do not endanger public health or safety or the environment; and

   b. Compliance with the rules or regulations from which variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public.

2. No variance shall be granted pursuant to this section until the department of ecology or board has considered the relative interests of the applicant, other owners of property likely to be affected by the discharges, and the general public.

3. Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the requirements of subsection (1) of this section and under conditions consistent with the reasons therefor, and within the following limitations:

   a. If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement or control of the pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement or control become known and available, and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the department of ecology or board may prescribe.

   b. If the variance is granted on the ground that compliance with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will require the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the department of ecology or board is requisite for the taking of the necessary measures. A variance granted on the ground specified herein shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to such timetable.

   c. If the variance is granted on the ground that it is justified to relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than that provided for in (a) and (b) of this subsection, it shall be for not more than one year.

4. Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed on terms and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance. If complaint is made to the department of ecology or board on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be granted unless following a public hearing on the complaint on due notice the department or board finds that renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the variance. Immediately upon receipt of an application for renewal, the department of ecology or board shall give public notice of such application in accordance with rules of the department of ecology or board.

5. A variance or renewal shall not be a right of the applicant or holder thereof but shall be granted at the discretion of the department of ecology or board. However, any applicant adversely affected by the denial or the terms and conditions of the granting of an application for a variance or renewal of a variance by the department of ecology or board may obtain judicial review thereof under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW as now or hereafter amended.

6. Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency provisions and procedures of RCW 70A.15.6000 through 70A.15.6040 to any person or his or her property.

7. An application for a variance, or for the renewal thereof, submitted to the department of ecology or board pursuant to this section shall be approved or disapproved by the department or board within sixty-five days of receipt unless the applicant and the department of ecology or board agree to a continuance.

8. Variances approved under this section shall not be included in orders or permits provided for in RCW 70A.15.2260 or 70A.15.2210 until such time as the variance has been accepted by the United States environmental protection agency as part of an approved state implementation plan.

## 70A.15.3000 - Powers and duties of department.
1. The department shall have all the powers as provided in RCW 70A.15.2040.

2. The department, in addition to any other powers vested in it by law after consideration at a public hearing held in accordance with chapters 42.30 and 34.05 RCW shall:

   a. Adopt rules establishing air quality objectives and air quality standards;

   b. Adopt emission standards which shall constitute minimum emission standards throughout the state. An authority may enact more stringent emission standards, except for emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices which shall be statewide, but in no event may less stringent standards be enacted by an authority without the prior approval of the department after public hearing and due notice to interested parties;

   c. Adopt by rule air quality standards and emission standards for the control or prohibition of emissions to the outdoor atmosphere of radionuclides, dust, fumes, mist, smoke, other particulate matter, vapor, gas, odorous substances, or any combination thereof. Such requirements may be based upon a system of classification by types of emissions or types of sources of emissions, or combinations thereof, which it determines most feasible for the purposes of this chapter. However, an industry, or the air pollution control authority having jurisdiction, can choose, subject to the submittal of appropriate data that the industry has quantified, to have any limit on the opacity of emissions from a source whose emission standard is stated in terms of a weight of particulate per unit volume of air (e.g., grains per dry standard cubic foot) be based on the applicable particulate emission standard for that source, such that any violation of the opacity limit accurately indicates a violation of the applicable particulate emission standard. Any alternative opacity limit provided by this section that would result in increasing air contaminants emissions in any nonattainment area shall only be granted if equal or greater emission reductions are provided for by the same source obtaining the revised opacity limit. A reasonable fee may be assessed to the industry to which the alternate opacity standard would apply. The fee shall cover only those costs to the air pollution control authority which are directly related to the determination on the acceptability of the alternate opacity standard, including testing, oversight and review of data.

3. The air quality standards and emission standards may be for the state as a whole or may vary from area to area or source to source, except that emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices shall be statewide, as may be appropriate to facilitate the accomplishment of the objectives of this chapter and to take necessary or desirable account of varying local conditions of population concentration, the existence of actual or reasonably foreseeable air pollution, topographic and meteorologic conditions and other pertinent variables.

4. The department is directed to cooperate with the appropriate agencies of the United States or other states or any interstate agencies or international agencies with respect to the control of air pollution and air contamination, or for the formulation for the submission to the legislature of interstate air pollution control compacts or agreements.

5. The department is directed to conduct or cause to be conducted a continuous surveillance program to monitor the quality of the ambient atmosphere as to concentrations and movements of air contaminants and conduct or cause to be conducted a program to determine the quantity of emissions to the atmosphere.

6. The department shall enforce the air quality standards and emission standards throughout the state except where a local authority is enforcing the state regulations or its own regulations which are more stringent than those of the state.

7. The department shall encourage local units of government to handle air pollution problems within their respective jurisdictions; and, on a cooperative basis provide technical and consultative assistance therefor.

8. The department shall have the power to require the addition to or deletion of a county or counties from an existing authority in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter. No such addition or deletion shall be made without the concurrence of any existing authority involved. Such action shall only be taken after a public hearing held pursuant to the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW.

9. The department shall establish rules requiring sources or source categories to apply reasonable and available control methods. Such rules shall apply to those sources or source categories that individually or collectively contribute the majority of statewide air emissions of each regulated pollutant. The department shall review, and if necessary, update its rules every five years to ensure consistency with current reasonable and available control methods. The department shall have adopted rules required under this subsection for all sources by July 1, 1996.

For the purposes of this section, "reasonable and available control methods" shall include but not be limited to, changes in technology, processes, or other control strategies.

## 70A.15.3070 - Hearing upon activation of authority—Finding—Assumption of jurisdiction by department—Expenses.
The department may, at any time and on its own motion, hold a hearing to determine if the activation of an authority is necessary for the prevention, abatement, and control of air pollution which exists or is likely to exist in any area of the state. Notice of such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 42.30 RCW and chapter 34.05 RCW. If at such hearing the department finds that air pollution exists or is likely to occur in a particular area, and that the purposes of this chapter and the public interest will be best served by the activation of an authority it shall designate the boundaries of such area and set forth in a report to the appropriate county or counties recommendations for the activation of an authority: PROVIDED, That if at such hearing the department determines that the activation of an authority is not practical or feasible for the reason that a local or regional air pollution control program cannot be successfully established or operated due to unusual circumstances and conditions, but that the control and/or prevention of air pollution is necessary for the purposes of this chapter and the public interest, it may assume jurisdiction and so declare by order. Such order shall designate the geographic area in which, and the effective date upon which, the department will exercise jurisdiction for the control and/or prevention of air pollution. The department shall exercise its powers and duties in the same manner as if it had assumed authority under RCW 70A.15.3110.

All expenses incurred by the department in the control and prevention of air pollution in any county pursuant to the provisions of RCW 70A.15.3070 and 70A.15.3110 shall constitute a claim against such county. The department shall certify the expenses to the auditor of the county, who promptly shall issue his or her warrant on the county treasurer payable out of the current expense fund of the county. In the event that the amount in the current expense fund of the county is not adequate to meet the expenses incurred by the department, the department shall certify to the state treasurer that it has a prior claim on any money in the "liquor excise tax fund" that is to be apportioned to that county by the state treasurer as provided in RCW 82.08.170. In the event that the amount in the "liquor excise tax fund" that is to be apportioned to that county by the state treasurer is not adequate to meet the expenses incurred by the department, the department shall certify to the state treasurer that they have a prior claim on any excess funds from the liquor revolving fund that are to be distributed to that county as provided in RCW 66.08.190 through * 66.08.220. All moneys that are collected as provided in this section shall be placed in the general fund in the account of the office of air programs of the department.

## 70A.15.3080 - Air contaminant sources—Regulation by department; authorities may be more stringent—Hearing—Standards.
If the department finds, after public hearing upon due notice to all interested parties, that the emissions from a particular type or class of air contaminant source should be regulated on a statewide basis in the public interest and for the protection of the welfare of the citizens of the state, it may adopt and enforce rules to control and/or prevent the emission of air contaminants from such source. An authority may, after public hearing and a finding by the board of a need for more stringent rules than those adopted by the department under this section, propose the adoption of such rules by the department for the control of emissions from the particular type or class of air contaminant source within the geographical area of the authority. The department shall hold a public hearing and shall adopt the proposed rules within the area of the requesting authority, unless it finds that the proposed rules are inconsistent with the rules adopted by the department under this section. When such standards are adopted by the department it shall delegate solely to the requesting authority all powers necessary for their enforcement at the request of the authority. If after public hearing the department finds that the regulation on a statewide basis of a particular type or class of air contaminant source is no longer required for the public interest and the protection of the welfare of the citizens of the state, the department may relinquish exclusive jurisdiction over such source.

Such order, a certified copy of which shall be filed with the secretary of state, shall specify the participating county or counties and the effective date by which the authority shall begin to function and exercise its powers. Any authority activated by order of the department shall choose the members of its board as provided in RCW 70A.15.2000 and begin to function in the same manner as if it had been activated by resolutions of the county or counties included within its boundaries. The department may, upon due notice to all interested parties, conduct a hearing in accordance with chapter 42.30 RCW and chapter 34.05 RCW within six months after the order was issued to review such order and to ascertain if such order is being carried out in good faith. At such time the department may amend any such order issued if it is determined by the department that such order is being carried out in bad faith or the department may take the appropriate action as is provided in RCW 70A.15.3110.

## 70A.15.3500 - Woodstoves—Policy.
In the interest of the public health and welfare and in keeping with the objectives of RCW 70A.15.1005, the legislature declares it to be the public policy of the state to control, reduce, and prevent air pollution caused by woodstove emissions. It is the state's policy to reduce woodstove emissions by encouraging the department of ecology to continue efforts to educate the public about the effects of woodstove emissions, other heating alternatives, and the desirability of achieving better emission performance and heating efficiency from woodstoves. The legislature further declares that: (1) The purchase of certified woodstoves will not solve the problem of pollution caused by woodstove emissions; and (2) the reduction of air pollution caused by woodstove emissions will only occur when woodstove users adopt proper methods of wood burning.

## 70A.15.3530 - Solid fuel burning devices—Emission performance standards.
The department of ecology shall establish by rule under chapter 34.05 RCW:

1. Statewide emission performance standards for new solid fuel burning devices. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter which allows an authority to adopt more stringent emission standards, no authority shall adopt any emission standard for new solid fuel burning devices other than the statewide standard adopted by the department under this section.

   a. After January 1, 1995, no solid fuel burning device shall be offered for sale in this state to residents of this state that does not meet the following particulate air contaminant emission standards under the test methodology of the United States environmental protection agency in effect on January 1, 1991, or an equivalent standard under any test methodology adopted by the United States environmental protection agency subsequent to such date: (i) Two and one-half grams per hour for catalytic woodstoves; and (ii) four and one-half grams per hour for all other solid fuel burning devices. For purposes of this subsection, "equivalent" shall mean the emissions limits specified in this subsection multiplied by a statistically reliable conversion factor determined by the department that compares the difference between the emission test methodology established by the United States environmental protection agency prior to May 15, 1991, with the test methodology adopted subsequently by the agency. Subsection (a) of this subsection does not apply to fireplaces.

   b. After January 1, 1997, no fireplace, except masonry fireplaces, shall be offered for sale unless such fireplace meets the 1990 United States environmental protection agency standards for woodstoves or equivalent standard that may be established by the state building code council by rule. Prior to January 1, 1997, the state building code council shall establish by rule a methodology for the testing of factory-built fireplaces. The methodology shall be designed to achieve a particulate air emission standard equivalent to the 1990 United States environmental protection agency standard for woodstoves. In developing the rules, the council shall include on the technical advisory committee at least one representative from the masonry fireplace builders and at least one representative of the factory-built fireplace manufacturers.

   c. Prior to January 1, 1997, the state building code council shall establish by rule design standards for the construction of new masonry fireplaces in Washington state. In developing the rules, the council shall include on the technical advisory committee at least one representative from the masonry fireplace builders and at least one representative of the factory-built fireplace manufacturers. It shall be the goal of the council to develop design standards that generally achieve reductions in particulate air contaminant emissions commensurate with the reductions being achieved by factory-built fireplaces at the time the standard is established.

   d. Actions of the department and local air pollution control authorities under this section shall preempt actions of other state agencies and local governments for the purposes of controlling air pollution from solid fuel burning devices, except where authorized by chapter 199, Laws of 1991.

   e. Subsection (1)(a) of this section shall not apply to fireplaces.

   f. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, the department is authorized to adopt, by rule, emission standards adopted by the United States environmental protection agency for new woodstoves sold at retail. For solid fuel burning devices for which the United States environmental protection agency has not established emission standards, the department may exempt or establish, by rule, statewide standards including emission levels and test procedures for such devices and such emission levels and test procedures shall be equivalent to emission levels per pound per hour burned for other new woodstoves and fireplaces regulated under this subsection.

2. A program to:

   a. Determine whether a new solid fuel burning device complies with the statewide emission performance standards established in subsection (1) of this section; and

   b. Approve the sale of devices that comply with the statewide emission performance standards.

## 70A.15.4000 - Transportation demand management—Findings.
The legislature finds that automotive traffic in Washington's metropolitan areas is the major source of emissions of air contaminants. This air pollution causes significant harm to public health, causes damage to trees, plants, structures, and materials and degrades the quality of the environment.

Increasing automotive traffic is also aggravating traffic congestion in Washington's metropolitan areas. This traffic congestion imposes significant costs on Washington's businesses, governmental agencies, and individuals in terms of lost working hours and delays in the delivery of goods and services. Traffic congestion worsens automobile-related air pollution, increases the consumption of fuel, and degrades the habitability of many of Washington's cities and suburban areas. The capital and environmental costs of fully accommodating the existing and projected automobile traffic on roads and highways are prohibitive. Decreasing the demand for vehicle trips is significantly less costly and at least as effective in reducing traffic congestion and its impacts as constructing new transportation facilities such as roads and bridges, to accommodate increased traffic volumes.

The legislature also finds that increasing automotive transportation is a major factor in increasing consumption of gasoline and, thereby, increasing reliance on imported sources of petroleum. Moderating the growth in automotive travel is essential to stabilizing and reducing dependence on imported petroleum and improving the nation's energy security.

The legislature further finds that reducing the number of commute trips to work made via single-occupant cars and light trucks is an effective way of reducing automobile-related air pollution, traffic congestion, and energy use. Major employers have significant opportunities to encourage and facilitate reducing single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees. In addition, the legislature also recognizes the importance of increasing individual citizens' awareness of air quality, energy consumption, and traffic congestion, and the contribution individual actions can make towards addressing these issues.

The intent of this chapter is to require local governments in those counties experiencing the greatest automobile-related air pollution and traffic congestion to develop and implement plans to reduce single-occupant vehicle commute trips. Such plans shall require major employers and employers at major worksites to implement programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees at major worksites. Local governments in counties experiencing significant but less severe automobile-related air pollution and traffic congestion may implement such plans. State agencies shall implement programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting at all major worksites throughout the state.

The jurisdiction shall complete review of each employer's initial commute trip reduction program within ninety days of receipt.

2. Employers implementing commute trip reduction programs are expected to undertake good faith efforts to achieve the goals outlined in RCW 70A.15.4020(4). Employers are considered to be making a good faith effort if the following conditions have been met:

   a. The employer has met the minimum requirements identified in RCW 70A.15.4040;

   b. The employer has notified the jurisdiction of its intent to substantially change or modify its program and has either received the approval of the jurisdiction to do so or has acknowledged that its program may not be approved without additional modifications;

   c. The employer has provided adequate information and documentation of implementation when requested by the jurisdiction; and

   d. The employer is working collaboratively with its jurisdiction to continue its existing program or is developing and implementing program modifications likely to result in improvements to the program over an agreed upon length of time.

3. Each jurisdiction shall review at least once every two years each employer's progress and good faith efforts toward meeting the applicable commute trip reduction goals. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in this section, but is not likely to meet the applicable commute trip reduction goals, the jurisdiction shall work collaboratively with the employer to make modifications to the commute trip reduction program. Failure of an employer to reach the applicable commute trip reduction goals is not a violation of this chapter.

4. If an employer fails to make a good faith effort and fails to meet the applicable commute trip reduction goals, the jurisdiction shall work collaboratively with the employer to propose modifications to the program and shall direct the employer to revise its program within thirty days to incorporate those modifications or modifications which the jurisdiction determines to be equivalent.

5. Each jurisdiction implementing a commute trip reduction plan pursuant to this chapter may impose civil penalties, in the manner provided in chapter 7.80 RCW, for failure by an employer to implement a commute trip reduction program or to modify its commute trip reduction program as required in subsection (4) of this section. No major employer may be held liable for civil penalties for failure to reach the applicable commute trip reduction goals. No major employer shall be liable for civil penalties under this chapter if failure to achieve a commute trip reduction program goal was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith.

6. Jurisdictions shall notify major employers of the procedures for applying for goal modification or exemption from the commute trip reduction requirements based on the guidelines established by the commute trip reduction board authorized under RCW 70A.15.4060.

## 70A.15.5110 - Open burning of grasses grown for seed—Alternatives—Studies—Deposit of permit fees in special grass seed burning account—Procedures—Limitations—Report.
It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that strong efforts should be made to minimize adverse effects on air quality from the open burning of field and turf grasses grown for seed. To such end this section is intended to promote the development of economical and practical alternate agricultural practices to such burning, and to provide for interim regulation of such burning until practical alternates are found.

1. The department shall approve of a study or studies for the exploration and identification of economical and practical alternate agricultural practices to the open burning of field and turf grasses grown for seed. Any study conducted pursuant to this section shall be conducted by Washington State University. The university may not charge more than eight percent for administrative overhead. Prior to the issuance of any permit for such burning under RCW 70A.15.5090, there shall be collected a fee not to exceed one dollar per acre of crop to be burned. Any such fees received by any authority shall be transferred to the department of ecology. The department of ecology shall deposit all such acreage fees in the general fund.

2. The department shall allocate moneys annually for the support of any approved study or studies as provided for in subsection (1) of this section. The fee collected under subsection (1) of this section shall constitute the research portion of fees required under RCW 70A.15.5090 for open burning of grass grown for seed.

3. Whenever on the basis of information available to it, the department after public hearings have been conducted wherein testimony will be received and considered from interested parties wishing to testify shall conclude that any procedure, program, technique, or device constitutes a practical alternate agricultural practice to the open burning of field or turf grasses grown for seed, the department shall, by order, certify approval of such alternate. Thereafter, in any case which any such approved alternate is reasonably available, the open burning of field and turf grasses grown for seed shall be disallowed and no permit shall issue therefor.

4. Until approved alternates become available, the department or the authority may limit the number of acres on a pro rata basis among those affected for which permits to burn will be issued in order to effectively control emissions from this source.

5. Permits issued for burning of field and turf grasses may be conditioned to minimize emissions insofar as practical, including denial of permission to burn during periods of adverse meteorological conditions.

6. Every two years until grass seed burning is prohibited, Washington State University may prepare a brief report assessing the potential of the university's research to result in economical and practical alternatives to grass seed burning.

1. [Empty]

   a. The department of natural resources shall administer a program to reduce statewide emissions from silvicultural forest burning so as to achieve the following minimum objectives:

      i. Twenty percent reduction by December 31, 1994, providing a ceiling for emissions until December 31, 2000; and

      ii. Fifty percent reduction by December 31, 2000, providing a ceiling for emissions thereafter.

   b. Reductions shall be calculated from the average annual emissions level from calendar years 1985 to 1989, using the same methodology for both reduction and base year calculations.

2. [Empty]

   a. The department of natural resources, within twelve months after May 15, 1991, shall develop a plan, based upon the existing smoke management agreement to carry out the programs as described in this section in the most efficient, cost-effective manner possible. The plan shall be developed in consultation with the department of ecology, public and private landowners engaged in silvicultural forest burning, and representatives of the public.

   b. The plan shall recognize the variations in silvicultural forest burning including, but not limited to, a landowner's responsibility to abate an extreme fire hazard under chapter 76.04 RCW and other objectives of burning, including abating and preventing a fire hazard, geographic region, climate, elevation and slope, proximity to populated areas, diversity of land ownership, improving forest health and resiliency, decreasing forest insect or disease susceptibility, maintaining or restoring native vegetation, or otherwise enhancing resiliency to fire. The plan shall establish priorities that the department of natural resources shall use to allocate allowable emissions, including but not limited to, forest health and resiliency, silvicultural burning used to improve or maintain fire dependent ecosystems for rare plants or animals within state, federal, and private natural area preserves, natural resource conservation areas, parks, and other wildlife areas. The plan shall also recognize the real costs of the emissions program and recommend equitable fees to cover the costs of the program.

   c. The emission reductions in this section are to apply to all forestlands including those owned and managed by the United States. If the United States does not participate in implementing the plan, the departments of natural resources and ecology shall use all appropriate and available methods or enforcement powers to ensure participation.

   d. The plan shall include a tracking system designed to measure the degree of progress toward the emission reductions goals set in this section. The department of natural resources shall report annually to the department of ecology and the legislature on the status of the plan, emission reductions and progress toward meeting the objectives specified in this section, and the goals of this chapter and chapter 76.04 RCW.

3. If the December 31, 1994, emission reductions targets in this section are not met, the department of natural resources, in consultation with the department of ecology, shall use its authority granted in this chapter and chapter 76.04 RCW to immediately limit emissions from such burning to the 1994 target levels and limit silvicultural forest burning in subsequent years to achieve equal annual incremental reductions so as to achieve the December 31, 2000, target level. If, as a result of the program established in this section, the emission reductions are met in 1994, but are not met by December 31, 2000, the department of natural resources in consultation with the department of ecology shall immediately limit silvicultural forest burning to reduce emissions from such burning to the December 31, 2000, target level in all subsequent years.

4. Emissions from silvicultural burning in eastern Washington that is conducted for the purpose of restoring forest health or preventing the additional deterioration of forest health are exempt from the reduction targets and calculations in this section if the following conditions are met:

   a. The landowner submits a written request to the department identifying the location of the proposed burning and the nature of the forest health problem to be corrected. The request shall include a brief description of alternatives to silvicultural burning and reasons why the landowner believes the alternatives not to be appropriate.

   b. The department determines that the proposed silvicultural burning operation is being conducted to restore forest health or prevent additional deterioration to forest health; meets the requirements of the state smoke management plan to protect public health, visibility, and the environment; and will not be conducted during an air pollution episode or during periods of impaired air quality in the vicinity of the proposed burn.

   c. Upon approval of the request by the department and before burning, the landowner is encouraged to notify the public in the vicinity of the burn of the general location and approximate time of ignition.

## 70A.15.5140 - Burning permits for abating or prevention of forest fire hazards, management of ecosystems, instruction or silvicultural operations—Conditions for issuance and use of permits—Air quality standards to be met—Alternate methods to lessen forest debris.
The department of natural resources, in granting burning permits for fires for the purposes set forth in RCW 70A.15.5120, shall condition the issuance and use of such permits to comply to the extent feasible with air quality standards established by the department of ecology. Such burning shall not cause the state air quality standards to be exceeded in the ambient air up to two thousand feet above ground level over critical areas designated by the department of ecology, otherwise subject to air pollution from other sources. Air quality standards shall be established and published by the department of ecology which shall also establish a procedure for advising the department of natural resources when and where air contaminant levels exceed or threaten to exceed the ambient air standards over such critical areas. The air quality shall be quantitatively measured by the department of ecology or the appropriate local air pollution control authority at established monitoring stations over such designated areas. Further, such permitted burning shall not cause damage to public health or the environment. All permits issued under this section shall be subject to all applicable fees, permitting, penalty, and enforcement provisions of this chapter. The department of natural resources shall set forth smoke dispersal objectives designed consistent with this section to minimize any air pollution from such burning and the procedures necessary to meet those objectives.

The department of natural resources shall encourage more intense utilization in logging and alternative silviculture practices to reduce the need for burning. The department of natural resources shall, whenever practical, encourage landowners to develop and use alternative acceptable disposal methods subject to the following priorities: (1) Slash production minimization, (2) slash utilization, (3) nonburning disposal, (4) silvicultural burning. Such alternative methods shall be evaluated as to the relative impact on air, water, and land pollution, public health, and their financial feasibility.

The department of natural resources shall not issue burning permits and shall revoke previously issued permits at any time in any area where the department of ecology or local board has declared a stage of impaired air quality as defined in RCW 70A.15.3580.

## 70A.15.6000 - Air pollution episodes—Legislative finding—Declaration of policy.
The legislature finds that whenever meteorological conditions occur which reduce the effective volume of air into which air contaminants are introduced, there is a high danger that normal operations at air contaminant sources in the area affected will be detrimental to public health or safety. Whenever such conditions, herein denominated as air pollution episodes, are forecast, there is a need for rapid short-term emission reduction in order to avoid adverse health or safety consequences.

Therefore, it is declared to be the policy of this state that an episode avoidance plan should be developed and implemented for the temporary reduction of emissions during air pollution episodes.

It is further declared that power should be vested in the governor to issue emergency orders for the reduction or discontinuance of emissions when such emissions and weather combine to create conditions imminently dangerous to public health and safety.

## 70A.15.6010 - Air pollution episodes—Episode avoidance plan—Contents—Source emission reduction plans—Authority—Considered orders.
The department of ecology is hereby authorized to develop an episode avoidance plan providing for the phased reduction of emissions wherever and whenever an air pollution episode is forecast. Such an episode avoidance plan shall conform with any applicable federal standards and shall be effective statewide. The episode avoidance plan may be implemented on an area basis in accordance with the occurrence of air pollution episodes in any given area.

The department of ecology may delegate authority to adopt source emission reduction plans and authority to implement all stages of occurrence up to and including the warning stage, and all intermediate stages up to the warning stage, in any area of the state, to the air pollution control authority with jurisdiction therein.

The episode avoidance plan, which shall be established by regulation in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. The designation of episode criteria and stages, the occurrence of which will require the carrying out of preplanned episode avoidance procedures. The stages of occurrence shall be (a) forecast, (b) alert, (c) warning, (d) emergency, and such intermediate stages as the department shall designate. "Forecast" means the presence of meteorological conditions that are conducive to accumulation of air contaminants and is the first stage of an episode. The department shall not call a forecast episode prior to the department or an authority calling a first stage impaired air quality condition as provided by RCW 70A.15.3580(1)(b) or calling a single-stage impaired air quality condition as provided by RCW 70A.15.3580. "Alert" means concentration of air contaminants at levels at which short-term health effects may occur, and is the second stage of an episode. "Warning" means concentrations are continuing to degrade, contaminant concentrations have reached a level which, if maintained, can result in damage to health, and additional control actions are needed and is the third level of an episode. "Emergency" means the air quality is posing an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and is the fourth level of an episode;

2. The requirement that persons responsible for the operation of air contaminant sources prepare and obtain approval from the director of source emission reduction plans, consistent with good operating practice and safe operating procedures, for reducing emissions during designated episode stages;

3. Provision for the director of the department of ecology or his or her authorized representative, or the air pollution control officer if implementation has been delegated, on the satisfaction of applicable criteria, to declare and terminate the forecast, alert, warning and all intermediate stages, up to the warning episode stage, such declarations constituting orders for action in accordance with applicable source emission reduction plans;

4. Provision for the governor to declare and terminate the emergency stage and all intermediate stages above the warning episode stage, such declarations constituting orders in accordance with applicable source emission reduction plans;

5. Provisions for enforcement by state and local police, personnel of the departments of ecology and social and health services, and personnel of local air pollution control agencies; and

6. Provisions for reduction or discontinuance of emissions immediately, consistent with good operating practice and safe operating procedures, under an air pollution emergency as provided in RCW 70A.15.6020.

Source emission reduction plans shall be considered orders of the department and shall be subject to appeal to the pollution control hearings board according to the procedure in chapter 43.21B RCW.

## 70A.15.6200 - Legislative declaration—Intent.
The legislature recognizes that:

1. Acid deposition resulting from commercial, industrial or other emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides pose a threat to the delicate balance of the state's ecological systems, particularly in alpine lakes that are known to be highly sensitive to acidification;

2. Failure to act promptly and decisively to mitigate or eliminate this danger may soon result in untold and irreparable damage to the fish, forest, wildlife, agricultural, water, and recreational resources of this state;

3. There is a direct correlation between emissions of sulphur dioxides and nitrogen oxides and increases in acid deposition;

4. Acidification is cumulative; and

5. Once an environment is acidified, it is difficult, if not impossible, to restore the natural balance.

It is therefore the intent of the legislature to provide for early detection of acidification and the resulting environmental degradation through continued monitoring of acid deposition levels and trends, and major source changes, so that the legislature can take any necessary action to prevent environmental degradation resulting from acid deposition.

## 70A.15.6210 - Definitions.
As used in RCW 70A.15.6200 through 70A.15.6220, the following terms have the following meanings.
