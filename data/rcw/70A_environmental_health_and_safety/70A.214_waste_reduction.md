## 70A.214.010 - Legislative findings.
The legislature finds that land disposal and incineration of solid and hazardous waste can be both harmful to the environment and costly to those who must dispose of the waste. In order to address this problem in the most cost-effective and environmentally sound manner, and to implement the highest waste management priority as articulated in RCW 70A.205.005 and 70A.300.260, public and private efforts should focus on reducing the generation of waste. Waste reduction can be achieved by encouraging voluntary efforts to redesign industrial, commercial, production, and other processes to result in the reduction or elimination of waste by-products and to maximize the in-process reuse or reclamation of valuable spent material.

In the interest of protecting the public health, safety, and the environment, the legislature declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage reduction in the use of hazardous substances and reduction in the generation of hazardous waste whenever economically and technically practicable.

The legislature finds that hazardous wastes are generated by numerous different sources including, but not limited to, large and small business, households, and state and local government. The legislature further finds that a goal against which efforts at waste reduction may be measured is essential for an effective hazardous waste reduction program. The Pacific Northwest hazardous waste advisory council has endorsed a goal of reducing, through hazardous substance use reduction and waste reduction techniques, the generation of hazardous waste by fifty percent by 1995. The legislature adopts this as a policy goal for the state of Washington. The legislature recognizes that many individual businesses have already reduced the generation of hazardous waste through appropriate hazardous waste reduction techniques. The legislature also recognizes that there are some basic industrial processes which by their nature have limited potential for significantly reducing the use of certain raw materials or substantially reducing the generation of hazardous wastes. Therefore, the goal of reducing hazardous waste generation by fifty percent cannot be applied as a regulatory requirement.

## 70A.214.130 - Voluntary reduction plan, executive summary, or progress report—Department review.
1. The department may review a plan, executive summary, or an annual progress report to determine whether the plan, executive summary, or annual progress report is adequate pursuant to the rules developed under this section and with the provisions of RCW 70A.214.110. In determining the adequacy of any plan, executive summary, or annual progress report, the department shall base its determination solely on whether the plan, executive summary, or annual progress report is complete and prepared in accordance with the provisions of RCW 70A.214.110.

2. Plans developed under RCW 70A.214.110 shall be retained at the facility of the hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator preparing a plan. The plan is not a public record under the public records act, chapter 42.56 RCW. A user or generator required to prepare a plan shall permit the director or a representative of the director to review the plan to determine its adequacy. No visit made by the director or a representative of the director to a facility for the purposes of this subsection may be regarded as an inspection or investigation, and no notices or citations may be issued, nor any civil penalty assessed, upon such a visit.

3. If a hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator fails to complete an adequate plan, executive summary, or annual progress report, the department shall notify the user or generator of the inadequacy, identifying specific deficiencies. For the purposes of this section, a deficiency may include failure to develop a plan, failure to submit an executive summary pursuant to the schedule provided in RCW 70A.214.110(5), and failure to submit an annual progress report pursuant to the rules developed under RCW 70A.214.110(6). The department shall specify a reasonable time frame, of not less than ninety days, within which the user or generator shall complete a modified plan, executive summary, or annual progress report addressing the specified deficiencies.

4. If the department determines that a modified plan, executive summary, or annual progress report is inadequate, the department may, within its discretion, either require further modification or enter an order pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section.

5. [Empty]

   a. If, after having received a list of specified deficiencies from the department, a hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator required to prepare a plan fails to complete modification of a plan, executive summary, or annual progress report within the time period specified by the department, the department may enter an order pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW finding the user or generator not in compliance with the requirements of RCW 70A.214.110. When the order is final, the department shall notify the department of revenue to charge a penalty fee. The penalty fee shall be the greater of one thousand dollars or three times the amount of the user's or generator's previous year's fee, in addition to the current year's fee. If no fee was assessed the previous year, the penalty shall be the greater of one thousand dollars or three times the amount of the current year's fee. The penalty assessed under this subsection shall be collected each year after the year for which the penalty was assessed until an adequate plan or executive summary is completed.

   b. If a hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator required to prepare a plan fails to complete an adequate plan, executive summary, or annual progress report after the department has levied against the user or generator the penalty provided in (a) of this subsection, the user or generator shall be required to pay a surcharge to the department whenever the user or generator disposes of a hazardous waste at any hazardous waste incinerator or hazardous waste landfill facility located in Washington state, until a plan, executive summary, or annual progress report is completed and determined to be adequate by the department. The surcharge shall be equal to three times the fee charged for disposal. The department shall furnish the incinerator and landfill facilities in this state with a list of environmental protection agency/state identification numbers of the hazardous waste generators that are not in compliance with the requirements of RCW 70A.214.110.

## 70A.214.150 - Public inspection of plans, summaries, progress reports.
1. The department shall make available for public inspection any executive summary or annual progress report submitted to the department. Any hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator required to prepare an executive summary or annual progress report who believes that disclosure of any information contained in the executive summary or annual progress report may adversely affect the competitive position of the user or generator may request the department pursuant to RCW 43.21A.160 to delete from the public record those portions of the executive summary or annual progress report that may affect the user's or generator's competitive position. The department shall not disclose any information contained in an executive summary or annual progress report pending a determination of whether the department will delete any information contained in the report from the public record.

2. Any ten persons residing within ten miles of a hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator required to prepare a plan may file with the department a petition requesting the department to examine a plan to determine its adequacy. The department shall report its determination of adequacy to the petitioners and to the user or generator within a reasonable time. The department may deny a petition if the department has within the previous year determined the plan of the user or generator named in the petition to be adequate.

3. The department shall maintain a record of each plan, executive summary, or annual progress report it reviews, and a list of all plans, executive summaries, or annual progress reports the department has determined to be inadequate, including descriptions of corrective actions taken. This information shall be made available to the public.
