## 70A.25.080 - Vehicle emission and equipment standards—Designation of noncompliance areas and emission contributing areas.
The director:

1. Shall adopt motor vehicle emission and equipment standards to: Ensure that no less than seventy percent of the vehicles tested comply with the standards on the first inspection conducted, meet federal clean air act requirements, and protect human health and the environment.

2. Shall adopt rules implementing the smoke opacity testing requirement for diesel vehicles that ensure that such test is objective and repeatable and that properly maintained engines that otherwise would meet the applicable federal emission standards, as measured by the new engine certification test, would not fail the smoke opacity test.

3. Shall designate a geographic area as being a "noncompliance area" for motor vehicle emissions if (a) the department's analysis of emission and ambient air quality data, covering a period of no less than one year, indicates that the standard has or will probably be exceeded, and (b) the department determines that the primary source of the air contaminant is motor vehicle emissions.

4. Shall reevaluate noncompliance areas if the United States environmental protection agency modifies the relevant air quality standards, and shall discontinue the program if compliance is indicated and if the department determines that the area would continue to be in compliance after the program is discontinued. The director shall notify persons residing in noncompliance areas of the reevaluation.

5. Shall analyze information regarding the motor vehicle traffic in a noncompliance area to determine the smallest land area within whose boundaries are present registered motor vehicles that contribute significantly to the violation of motor vehicle-related air quality standards in the noncompliance area. The director shall declare the area to be an "emission contributing area." An emission contributing area established for a carbon monoxide or oxides of nitrogen noncompliance area must contain the noncompliance area within its boundaries. An emission contributing area established for an ozone noncompliance area located in this state need not contain the ozone noncompliance area within its boundaries if it can be proven that vehicles registered in the area contribute significantly to violations of the ozone air quality standard in the noncompliance area. An emission contributing area may be established in this state for violations of federal air quality standards for ozone in an adjacent state if (a) the United States environmental protection agency designates an area to be a "nonattainment area for ozone" under the provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and (b) it can be proven that vehicles registered in this state contribute significantly to the violation of the federal air quality standards for ozone in the adjacent state's nonattainment area.

6. Shall, after consultation with the appropriate local government entities, designate areas as being noncompliance areas or emission contributing areas, and shall establish the boundaries of such areas by rule. The director may also modify boundaries. In establishing the external boundaries of an emission contributing area, the director shall use the boundaries established for ZIP code service areas by the United States postal service.

7. May make grants to units of government in support of planning efforts to reduce motor vehicle emissions.

\[ [1991 c 199 § 207](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1028-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20199%20§%20207); [1989 c 240 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c240.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20240%20§%202); \]

## 70A.25.090 - Noncompliance areas—Annual review.
1. The director shall review annually the air quality and forecasted air quality of each area in the state designated as a noncompliance area for motor vehicle emissions.

2. An area shall no longer be designated as a noncompliance area if the director determines that:

   a. Air quality standards for contaminants derived from motor vehicle emissions are no longer being violated in the noncompliance area; and

   b. The standards would not be violated if the emission inspection system in the emission contributing area was discontinued and the requirements of RCW 46.16A.060 no longer applied.

\[ [2011 c 171 § 109](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5061.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20171%20§%20109); [1989 c 240 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c240.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20240%20§%203); \]

## 70A.25.110 - Used vehicles.
1. Motor vehicle dealers selling a used vehicle not under a new vehicle warranty shall include a notice in each vehicle purchase order form that reads as follows: "The owner of a vehicle may be required to spend up to (a dollar amount established under RCW 70A.25.030) for repairs if the vehicle does not meet the vehicle emission standards under this chapter. Unless expressly warranted by the motor vehicle dealer, the dealer is not warranting that this vehicle will pass any emission tests required by federal or state law."

2. The signature of the purchaser on the notice required under subsection (1) of this section shall constitute a valid disclaimer of any implied warranty by the dealer as to a vehicle's compliance with any emission standards.

3. The disclosure requirement of subsection (1) of this section applies to all motor vehicle dealers located in counties where state emission inspections are required.

\[ [2020 c 20 § 1365](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2246-S.SL.pdf?cite=2020%20c%2020%20§%201365); [1991 c 199 § 210](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1028-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20199%20§%20210); \]

## 70A.25.120 - Clean-fuel performance and clean-fuel vehicle emissions specifications.
By July 1, 1992, the department shall develop, in cooperation with the departments of *general administration and transportation, and Washington State University, aggressive clean-fuel performance and clean-fuel vehicle emissions specifications including clean-fuel vehicle conversion equipment. To the extent possible, such specifications shall be equivalent for all fuel types. In developing such specifications the department shall consider the requirements of the clean air act and the findings of the environmental protection agency, other states, the American petroleum institute, the gas research institute, and the motor vehicles manufacturers association.

## 70A.25.130 - Scientific advisory board—Composition of board—Duties.
The department shall establish a scientific advisory board to review plans to establish or expand the geographic area where an inspection and maintenance system for motor vehicle emissions is required. The board shall consist of three to five members. All members shall have at least a master's degree in physics, chemistry, or engineering, or a closely related field. No member may be a current employee of a local air pollution control authority, the department, the United States environmental protection agency, or a company that may benefit from a review by the board.

The board shall review an inspection and maintenance plan at the request of a local air pollution control authority, the department, or by a petition of at least fifty people living within the proposed boundaries of a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance system. The entity or entities requesting a scientific review may include specific issues for the board to consider in its review. The board shall limit its review to matters of science and shall not provide advice on penalties or issues that are strictly legal in nature.

The board shall provide a complete written review to the department. If the board members are not in agreement as to the scientific merit of any issue under review, the board may include a dissenting opinion in its report to the department. The department shall immediately make copies available to the local air pollution control authority and to the public.

The department shall conduct a public hearing, within the area affected by the proposed rule, if any significant aspect of the rule is in conflict with a majority opinion of the board. The department shall include in its responsiveness summary the rationale for including a rule that is not consistent with the review of the board, including a response to the issues raised at the public hearing.

Members shall be reimbursed for travel expenses as provided in RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.
