## 70A.340.010 - Findings.
The legislature finds that:

1. Brake friction material is an essential component of motor vehicle brakes and is critically important to transportation safety and public safety in general;

2. Debris from brake friction material containing copper and its compounds is generated and released to the environment during normal operation of motor vehicle brakes;

3. Thousands of pounds of copper and other substances released from brake friction material enter Washington state's streams, rivers, and marine environment every year; and

4. Copper is toxic to many aquatic organisms, including salmon.

## 70A.340.060 - Application for exemption from chapter.
Any motor vehicle manufacturer or brake friction material manufacturer may apply to the department for an exemption from this chapter for brake friction material intended for a specific motor vehicle model or class of motor vehicles based on special needs or characteristics of the motor vehicles for which the brake friction material is intended. Exemptions may only be issued for small volume motor vehicle manufacturers, specific motor vehicle models, or special classes of vehicles, such as fire trucks, police cars, and heavy or wide-load equipment hauling, provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that complying with the requirements of this chapter is not feasible, does not allow compliance with safety standards, or causes significant financial hardship. Exemptions are valid for no less than one year and may be renewed automatically as needed or the exemption may be permanent for as long as the vehicle is used in the manner described in the application.

\[ [2010 c 147 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6557-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20147%20§%206); \]

2. Using data provided pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and other data as needed, and in consultation with the brake friction material manufacturing industry, the department must:

   a. By July 1, 2013, establish baseline concentration levels for constituents identified in subsection (1) of this section in brake friction material; and

   b. Track progress toward reducing the use of copper and its compounds and ensure that concentration levels of antimony, nickel, or zinc and their compounds do not increase by more than fifty percent above baseline concentration levels.

3. If concentration levels of antimony, nickel, or zinc and their compounds in brake friction material increase by more than fifty percent above baseline concentration levels, the department shall review scientific studies to determine the potential impact of the constituent on human health and the environment. If scientific studies demonstrate the need for controlling the use of the constituent in brake friction material, the department may consider recommending limits on concentration levels of the constituent in the material.

4. Confidential business information otherwise protected under RCW 43.21A.160 or chapter 42.56 RCW is exempt from public disclosure.

\[ [2010 c 147 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6557-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20147%20§%207); \]

## 70A.340.080 - Compliance with chapter—Proof of compliance.

## 70A.340.090 - Enforcement of chapter—Violations—Penalties.
1. The department must enforce this chapter. The department may periodically purchase and test brake friction material sold or offered for sale in Washington state to verify that the material complies with this chapter.

2. Enforcement of this chapter by the department must rely on notification and information exchange between the department and manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. The department must issue one warning letter by certified mail to a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer that sells or offers to sell brake friction material in violation of this chapter, and offer information or other appropriate assistance regarding compliance with this chapter. Once a warning letter has been issued to a distributor or retailer for violations under subsections (3) and (5) of this section, the department need not provide warning letters for subsequent violations by that distributor or retailer. For the purposes of subsection (6) of this section, a warning letter serves as notice of the violation. If compliance is not achieved, the department may assess penalties under this section.

3. A brake friction material distributor or retailer that violates this chapter is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation. Brake friction material distributors or retailers that sell brake friction material that is packaged consistent with RCW 70A.340.080(2)(b) are not in violation of this chapter. However, if the department conclusively proves that the brake friction material distributor or retailer was aware that the brake friction material being sold violates RCW 70A.340.030 or 70A.340.050, the brake friction material distributor or retailer is subject to civil penalties according to this section.

4. A brake friction material manufacturer that knowingly violates this chapter must recall the brake friction material and reimburse the brake friction distributor, retailer, or any other purchaser for the material and any applicable shipping and handling charges for returning the material. A brake friction material manufacturer that violates this chapter is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation.

5. A motor vehicle distributor or retailer that violates this chapter is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation. A motor vehicle distributor or retailer is not in violation of this chapter for selling a vehicle that was previously sold at retail and that contains brake friction material failing to meet the requirements of this chapter. However, if the department conclusively proves that the motor vehicle distributor or retailer installed brake friction material that violates RCW 70A.340.030, 70A.340.050, or 70A.340.080(2)(b) on the vehicle being sold and was aware that the brake friction material violates RCW 70A.340.030, 70A.340.050, or 70A.340.080(2)(b), the motor vehicle distributor or retailer is subject to civil penalties under this section.

6. A motor vehicle manufacturer that violates this chapter must notify the registered owner of the vehicle within six months of knowledge of the violation and must replace at no cost to the owner the noncompliant brake friction material with brake friction material that complies with this chapter. A motor vehicle manufacturer that fails to provide the required notification to registered owners of the affected vehicles within six months of knowledge of the violation is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars. A motor vehicle manufacturer that fails to provide the required notification to registered owners of the affected vehicles after twelve months of knowledge of the violation is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars per vehicle. For purposes of this section, "motor vehicle manufacturer" does not include a vehicle dealer defined under RCW 46.70.011 and required to be licensed as a vehicle dealer under chapter 46.70 RCW.

7. Before the effective date of the prohibitions in RCW 70A.340.030 or 70A.340.050, the department must prepare and distribute information about the prohibitions to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to the maximum extent practicable.

8. All penalties collected under this chapter must be deposited in the model toxics control operating account created in RCW 70A.305.180.
