## 70A.355.005 - Findings—Intent.
The legislature finds that leaking underground storage tanks containing petroleum and other regulated substances pose a serious threat to human health and the environment. To address this threat, the legislature intends for the department of ecology to establish an underground storage tank program designed, operated, and enforced in a manner that, at a minimum, meets the requirements for delegation of the federal underground storage tank program of the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. Sec. 6901, et seq.). The legislature intends that statewide requirements for underground storage tanks adopted by the department be consistent with and no less stringent than the requirements in the federal regulations and the underground storage tank compliance act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 15801 et seq., energy policy act of 2005, P.L. 109-58, Title XV, subtitle B).

The legislature further finds that certain areas of the state possess physical characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to threats from leaking underground storage tanks and that in these environmentally sensitive areas, local requirements more stringent than the statewide requirements may apply.

   a. Compliance monitoring, including procedures for recordkeeping and a program for systematic inspections;

   b. Enforcement;

   c. Public participation;

   d. Information sharing;

   e. Owner and operator training; and

   f. Delivery prohibition for underground storage tank systems or facilities that are determined by the department to be ineligible to receive regulated substances.

4. The department must establish a program that provides for the annual licensing of underground storage tanks. The license must take the form of a tank endorsement on the facility's annual business license issued by the department of revenue under chapter 19.02 RCW. A tank is not eligible for a license unless the owner or operator can demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the annual tank fees have been remitted. The department may revoke a tank license if a facility is not in compliance with this chapter, or any rules adopted under this chapter. The business license must be displayed by the tank owner or operator in a location clearly identifiable.

5. [Empty]

   a. The department must issue a one-time "facility compliance tag" to underground storage tank facilities that have installed the equipment required to meet corrosion protection, spill prevention, overfill prevention, leak detection standards, have demonstrated financial responsibility, and have paid annual tank fees. The facility must continue to maintain compliance with corrosion protection, spill prevention, overfill prevention, and leak detection standards, financial responsibility, and have remitted annual tank fees to display a facility compliance tag. The facility compliance tag must be displayed on or near the fire emergency shutoff device, or in the absence of such a device in close proximity to the fill pipes and clearly identifiable to persons delivering regulated substance to underground storage tanks.

   b. The department may revoke a facility compliance tag if a facility is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, or any rules adopted under this chapter.

6. The department may place a red tag on a tank at a facility if the department determines that the owner or operator is not in compliance with this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter regarding the compliance requirements related to that tank. Removal of a red tag without authorization from the department is a violation of this chapter.

7. The department may establish programs to certify persons who install or decommission underground storage tank systems or conduct inspections, testing, closure, cathodic protection, interior tank lining, corrective action, site assessments, or other activities required under this chapter. Certification programs must be designed to ensure that each certification will be effective in all jurisdictions of the state.

8. When adopting rules under this chapter, the department must consult with the state building code council to ensure coordination with the building and fire codes adopted under chapter 19.27 RCW.

## 70A.355.080 - Annual tank fee.
1. An annual tank fee of one hundred twenty dollars per tank is effective July 1, 2007, to June 30, 2008. An annual tank fee of one hundred forty dollars per tank is effective from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009. Effective July 1, 2009, the annual tank fee will increase up to one hundred sixty dollars per tank unless the department has received sufficient additional federal grant funding to offset the increased cost of implementation of the underground storage tank compliance act of 2005 (Title XV, Subtitle B of the energy policy act of 2005). Annually, beginning on July 1, 2010, and upon a finding by the department that a fee increase is necessary, the previous tank fee amount may be increased up to the fiscal growth factor for the next year. The fiscal growth factor is calculated by the office of financial management under RCW 43.135.025 for the upcoming biennium. The department shall use the fiscal growth factor to calculate the fee for the next year and shall publish the new fee by March 1st before the year for which the new fee is effective. The new tank fee is effective from July 1st to June 30th of every year. The tank fee shall be paid by every person who:

   a. Owns an underground storage tank located in this state; and

   b. Was required to provide notification to the department under the federal act.

This fee is not required of persons who have (i) permanently closed their tanks, and (ii) if required, have completed corrective action in accordance with the rules adopted under this chapter.

2. The department may authorize the imposition of additional annual local tank fees in environmentally sensitive areas designated under RCW 70A.355.030. Annual local tank fees may not exceed fifty percent of the annual state tank fee.

3. State and local tank fees collected under this section shall be deposited in the account established under RCW 70A.355.090.

4. Other than the annual local tank fee authorized for environmentally sensitive areas, no local government may levy an annual tank fee on the ownership or operation of an underground storage tank.
