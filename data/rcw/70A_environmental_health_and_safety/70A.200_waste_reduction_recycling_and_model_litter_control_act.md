## 70A.200.010 - Legislative findings.
1. The legislature finds:

   a. Washington state is experiencing rapid population growth and its citizens are increasingly mobile;

   b. There is a fundamental need for a healthful, clean, and beautiful environment;

   c. The proliferation and accumulation of litter discarded throughout this state impairs this need and constitutes a public health hazard;

   d. There is a need to conserve energy and natural resources, and the effective litter control and recovery and recycling of litter materials will serve to accomplish such conservation;

   e. In addition to effective litter control, there must be effective programs to accomplish waste reduction, the state's highest waste management priority; and

   f. There must also be effective systems to accomplish all components of recycling, including collection and processing.

2. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of the state's solid waste management problems, the legislation enacted in 1971 and entitled the "Model Litter Control and Recycling Act" is hereby renamed the "waste reduction, recycling, and model litter control act."

## 70A.200.020 - Declaration of purpose.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to accomplish litter control, increase waste reduction, and stimulate all components of recycling and composting throughout this state by delegating to the department of ecology the authority to:

   a. Conduct a permanent and continuous program to control and remove litter from this state to the maximum practical extent possible;

   b. Recover and recycle waste materials related to litter and littering;

   c. Foster public and private recycling of recyclable materials and composting of compostable materials;

   d. Increase public awareness of the need for waste reduction, recycling, litter control, and composting;

   e. Coordinate the litter collection efforts by other agencies identified in this chapter; and

   f. Coordinate and expend funds collected under chapter 82.19 RCW with priority given to products identified under RCW 82.19.020 and solely for the purposes of waste reduction, recycling, composting, and litter collection and control programs.

2. It is further the intent and purpose of this chapter to: (a) Create jobs for employment of youth in litter cleanup and related activities; (b) stimulate and encourage recycling; and (c) encourage proper and appropriate composting. This program shall include the compatible goal of recovery of recyclable materials to conserve energy and natural resources wherever practicable.

1. There is hereby created an account within the state treasury to be known as the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account shall be used as follows:

   a. Forty percent to the department of ecology, primarily for use by the departments of ecology, natural resources, revenue, transportation, and corrections, and the parks and recreation commission, for litter collection programs under RCW 70A.200.170. The amount to the department of ecology shall also be used for a central coordination function for litter control efforts statewide; to support employment of youth in litter cleanup as intended in RCW 70A.200.020, and for litter pick up using other authorized agencies; and for statewide public awareness programs under RCW 70A.200.150(7). The amount to the department shall also be used to defray the costs of administering the funding, coordination, and oversight of local government programs for waste reduction, litter control, recycling, and composting so that local governments can apply one hundred percent of their funding to achieving program goals. The amount to the department of revenue shall be used to enforce compliance with the litter tax imposed in chapter 82.19 RCW;

   b. [Empty]

      i. Twenty percent to the department for local government funding programs for waste reduction, litter control, recycling activities, and composting activities by cities and counties under RCW 70A.200.190, to be administered by the department of ecology; (ii) any unspent funds under (b)(i) of this subsection may be used to create and pay for a matching fund competitive grant program to be used by local governments for the development and implementation of contamination reduction and outreach plans for inclusion in comprehensive solid waste management plans or by local governments and nonprofit organizations for local or statewide education programs designed to help the public with litter control, waste reduction, recycling, and composting of primarily the products taxed under chapter 82.19 RCW. Recipients under this subsection include programs to reduce wasted food and food waste that are designed to achieve the goals established in RCW 70A.205.715(1) and that are consistent with the plan developed in RCW 70A.205.715(3). Grants must adhere to the following requirements: (A) No grant may exceed sixty thousand dollars; (B) grant recipients shall match the grant funding allocated by the department by an amount equal to twenty-five percent of eligible expenses. A local government's share of these costs may be met by cash or contributed services; (C) the obligation of the department to make grant payments is contingent upon the availability of the amount of money appropriated for this subsection (1)(b); and (D) grants are managed under the guidelines for existing grant programs; and

   c. Forty percent to the department of ecology to: (i) Implement activities under RCW 70A.200.150 for waste reduction, recycling, and composting efforts; (ii) provide technical assistance to local governments and commercial businesses to increase recycling markets and recycling and composting programs primarily for the products taxed under chapter 82.19 RCW designed to educate citizens about waste reduction, litter control, and recyclable and compostable products and programs; (iii) increase access to waste reduction, composting, and recycling programs, particularly for food packaging and plastic bags and appropriate composting techniques; and (iv) for programs to reduce wasted food and food waste that are designed to achieve the goals established in RCW 70A.205.715(1) and that are consistent with the plan developed in RCW 70A.205.715(3).

3. Not less than five percent and no more than ten percent of the amount appropriated into the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account every biennium shall be reserved for capital needs, including the purchase of vehicles for transporting crews and for collecting litter and solid waste. Capital funds shall be distributed among state agencies and local governments according to the same criteria provided in RCW 70A.200.170 for the remainder of the funds, so that the most effective waste reduction, litter control, recycling, and composting programs receive the most funding. The intent of this subsection is to provide funds for the purchase of equipment that will enable the department to account for the greatest return on investment in terms of reaching a zero litter goal.

4. Funds in the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account, collected under chapter 82.19 RCW, must be prioritized for the products identified under RCW 82.19.020 solely for the purposes of recycling, composting, and litter collection, reduction, and control programs.

5. During the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, Washington State University may use funds in the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account, collected under chapter 82.19 RCW, to conduct an organic waste study.
