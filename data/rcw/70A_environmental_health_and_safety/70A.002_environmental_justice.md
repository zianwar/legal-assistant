## 70A.02.005 - Purpose.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to reduce environmental and health disparities in Washington state and improve the health of all Washington state residents. This chapter implements the recommendations of the environmental justice task force established in section 221(48), chapter 415, Laws of 2019 entitled "Report to the Washington state governor and legislature, Environmental Justice Task Force: Recommendations for Prioritizing EJ in Washington State Government (October 2020)."

2. As conveyed in the task force report, Washington state studies and national studies found that people of color and low-income people continue to be disproportionately exposed to environmental harms in their communities. As a result, there is a higher risk of adverse health outcomes for those communities. This risk is amplified when overlaid on communities with preexisting social and economic barriers and environmental risks, and creates cumulative environmental health impacts, which chapter 314, Laws of 2021 seeks to prevent and mitigate.

This chapter also seeks to reduce exposure to environmental hazards within Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1151, due to off-reservation activities within the state, and to improve state practices to reduce contamination of traditional foods wherever they occur. Exposure to such hazards can result in generational health and ecological problems, particularly on small reservations where it is impossible to move away from a hazard.

3. Accordingly, the state has a compelling interest in preventing and addressing such environmental health disparities in the administration of ongoing and new environmental programs, including allocation of funds, and in administering these programs so as to remedy the effects of past disparate treatment of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.

4. The task force provided recommendations to state agencies for measurable goals and model policies to reduce environmental health inequities in Washington, equitable practices for meaningful community involvement, and how to use the environmental health disparities map to identify and promote the equitable distribution of environmental benefits to overburdened communities. In order for all communities in Washington state to be healthy and thriving, state government should aim to concentrate government actions to benefit communities that currently have the greatest environmental and health burdens.

   b. A covered agency must aspire to complete the environmental justice assessment for a significant agency action without delaying the completion of the underlying agency action.

2. [Empty]

   a. Consistent with RCW 70A.02.010(12)(e), for the purpose of preparing environmental justice assessments, a covered agency may deem actions significant that are additional to the significant agency actions identified in RCW 70A.02.010(12) (a) through (d), in iterative consultation with the council and interagency work group established under RCW 70A.02.110. By July 1, 2025, each covered agency must consider their agency's activities and identify and begin applying environmental justice assessments to any actions that the agency identifies as significant that are in addition to the significant agency actions identified in RCW 70A.02.010(12) (a) through (d). Significant agency actions designated by a covered agency under this subsection must be actions that may cause environmental harm or may affect the equitable distribution of environmental benefits to an overburdened community or a vulnerable population.

   b. In the identification of significant agency actions, covered agencies shall consider guidance issued by the council established in RCW 70A.02.110. Each covered agency must periodically review and update its identified types of significant agency actions for which an environmental justice assessment is required under this section, and the relevant factors to the agency's environmental justice assessments that result from the unique mission, authorities, and priorities of the agency.

3. By July 1, 2023, and periodically thereafter, after an opportunity for public comment on its determinations, each covered agency must:

   a. Publish on its website the types of agency actions that the agency has determined are significant agency actions that require an environmental justice assessment under this section, including any significant agency actions identified under subsection (2)(a) of this section;

   b. Provide notification of the determination of the types of significant agency actions in the Washington State Register; and

   c. Prepare an environmental justice assessment when considering a listed action, after publication of the list of any additional significant agency actions identified under (a) of this subsection.

   b. A covered agency may include items in the checklist required under subsection (4) of this section that are not specified in subsection (4) of this section.

   c. The completion of an environmental justice checklist under subsection (4) of this section is not required to be a comprehensive or an exhaustive examination of all potential impacts of a significant agency action and does not require a covered agency to conduct novel quantitative or economic analysis of the proposed significant agency action.

6. Based on the environmental justice assessment, each covered agency must seek, to the extent legal and feasible and consistent with the underlying statute being implemented, to reduce or eliminate the environmental harms and maximize the environmental benefits created by the significant agency action on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations. Consistent with agency authority, mission, and statutory responsibilities, the covered agency must consider each of the following methods for reducing environmental harms or equitably distributing environmental benefits:

   a. Eliminating the disparate impact of environmental harms on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations;

   b. Reducing cumulative environmental health impacts on overburdened communities or vulnerable populations;

   c. Preventing the action from adding to the cumulative environmental health impacts on overburdened communities or vulnerable populations;

   d. Providing equitable participation and meaningful engagement of vulnerable populations and overburdened communities in the development of the significant agency action;

   e. Prioritizing equitable distribution of resources and benefits to overburdened communities;

   f. Promoting positive workforce and job outcomes for overburdened communities;

   g. Meeting community needs identified by the affected overburdened community;
