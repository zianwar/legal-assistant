## 70A.224.005 - Finding.
1. The legislature finds that:

   a. Millions of gallons of used oil are generated each year in this state, and used oil is a valuable petroleum resource that can be recycled;

   b. The improper collection, transportation, recycling, use, or disposal of used oil contributes to the pollution of air, water, and land, and endangers public health and welfare;

   c. The private sector is a vital resource in the collection and recycling of used oil and should be involved in its collection and recycling whenever practicable.

2. In light of the harmful consequences of improper disposal and use of used oil, and its value as a resource, the legislature declares that the collection, recycling, and reuse of used oil is in the public interest.

3. The department, when appropriate, should promote the rerefining of used oil in its grants, public education, regulatory, and other programs.
