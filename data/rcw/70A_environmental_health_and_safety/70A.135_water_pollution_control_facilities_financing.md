## 70A.135.010 - Purpose—Legislative intent.
The long-range health and environmental goals for the state of Washington require the protection of the state's surface and underground waters for the health, safety, use, enjoyment, and economic benefit of its people. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide financial assistance to the state and to local governments for the planning, design, acquisition, construction, and improvement of water pollution control facilities and related activities in the achievement of state and federal water pollution control requirements for the protection of the state's waters.

It is the intent of the legislature that distribution of moneys for water pollution control facilities under this chapter be made on an equitable basis taking into consideration legal mandates, local effort, ratepayer impacts, and past distributions of state and federal moneys for water pollution control facilities.

It is the intent of this chapter that the cost of any water pollution control facility attributable to increased or additional capacity that exceeds one hundred ten percent of existing needs at the time of application for assistance under this chapter shall be entirely a local or private responsibility. It is the intent of this chapter that industrial pretreatment be paid by industries and that state funds shall not be used for such purposes.

3. "Nonpoint source water pollution" means pollution that enters any waters of the state from any dispersed water-based or land-use activities, including, but not limited to, atmospheric deposition, surface water runoff from agricultural lands, urban areas, and forestlands, subsurface or underground sources, and discharges from boats or other marine vessels.

   b. The cost to residential ratepayers if they had to finance water pollution control facilities without state assistance;

   c. Actions required under federal and state permits and compliance orders;

   d. The level of local fiscal effort by residential ratepayers since 1972 in financing water pollution control facilities;

   e. Except as otherwise conditioned by RCW 70A.135.110, whether the entity receiving assistance is a Puget Sound partner, as defined in RCW 90.71.010;

   f. Whether the project is referenced in the action agenda developed by the Puget Sound partnership under RCW 90.71.310;

   g. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 70A.135.120, and effective one calendar year following the development and statewide availability of urban forestry management plans and ordinances under RCW 76.15.090, whether the project is sponsored by an entity that has been recognized, and what gradation of recognition was received, in the evergreen community designation program created in RCW 76.15.090;

   h. The extent to which the applicant county or city, or if the applicant is another public body, the extent to which the county or city in which the applicant public body is located, has established programs to mitigate nonpoint pollution of the surface or subterranean water sought to be protected by the water pollution control facility named in the application for state assistance; and

   i. The recommendations of the Puget Sound partnership, created in RCW 90.71.210, and any other board, council, commission, or group established by the legislature or a state agency to study water pollution control issues in the state.

2. Except where necessary to address a public health need or substantial environmental degradation, a county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may not receive a grant or loan for water pollution control facilities unless it has adopted a comprehensive plan, including a capital facilities plan element, and development regulations as required by RCW 36.70A.040. A county, city, or town that has adopted a comprehensive plan and development regulations as provided in RCW 36.70A.040 may request a grant or loan for water pollution control facilities. This subsection does not require any county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 to adopt a comprehensive plan or development regulations before requesting a grant or loan under this chapter if such request is made before the expiration of the time periods specified in RCW 36.70A.040. A county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 that has not adopted a comprehensive plan and development regulations within the time periods specified in RCW 36.70A.040 is not prohibited from receiving a grant or loan under this chapter if the comprehensive plan and development regulations are adopted as required by RCW 36.70A.040 before the department executes a contractual agreement for the grant or loan.

3. Whenever the department is considering awarding grants or loans for public facilities to special districts requesting funding for a proposed facility located in a county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040, it shall consider whether the county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 in whose planning jurisdiction the proposed facility is located has adopted a comprehensive plan and development regulations as required by RCW 36.70A.040.

4. After January 1, 2010, any project designed to address the effects of water pollution on Puget Sound may be funded under this chapter only if the project is not in conflict with the action agenda developed by the Puget Sound partnership under RCW 90.71.310.
