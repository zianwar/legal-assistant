## 31.12.003 - Findings—Intent—1997 c 397.
The legislature finds that credit unions provide many valuable services to the consumers of this state and will be better prepared to continue providing these services if the Washington state credit union act is modernized, clarified, and reorganized.

Furthermore, the legislature finds that credit unions and credit union members will benefit by enacting provisions clearly specifying the director of financial institutions' authority to enforce statutory provisions.

Revisions to this chapter reflect the legislature's intent to modernize, clarify, and reorganize the existing act, and specify the director's enforcement authority. By enacting the revisions to this chapter, it is not the intent of the legislature to affect the scope of credit unions' field of membership or tax status, or impact federal parity provisions.

## 31.12.015 - Declaration of policy.
A credit union is a cooperative society organized under this chapter as a nonprofit corporation for the purposes of promoting thrift among its members and creating a source of credit for them at fair and reasonable rates of interest.

The director is the state's credit union regulatory authority whose purpose is to protect members' financial interests, the integrity of credit unions as cooperative institutions, and the interests of the general public, and to ensure that credit unions remain viable and competitive in this state.

Following the hearing the director may either rescind his or her finding or reaffirm the finding that the alternative share insurance program does not meet the standards in this section. If the finding is reaffirmed, the director shall order all credit unions whose shares are insured with the alternative share insurance program to file, immediately, an application with the national credit union administration to convert to the federal share insurance program.

Such activity may not pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the credit union or the credit union industry. The entity may be engaged in other activity that is not incidental to or complementary to the credit union's operations.

   b. A credit union may not invest in:

      i. A federal depository institution or state depository institution as those terms are defined in the federal deposit insurance act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1813; or

      ii. A bank holding company or savings bank holding company as those terms are defined in the federal bank holding company act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1841.

   c. Until January 1, 2025, the initial aggregate amount of funds invested under this subsection (2) shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the net worth of the credit union, and when combined with the amount of funds invested in organizations described in subsection (1)(h) of this section, shall not exceed 10 percent of the assets of the credit union, whichever is less.

   d. Beginning January 1, 2025, the initial aggregate amount of funds invested under this subsection (2) shall not exceed five percent of the net worth of the credit union, and when combined with the amount of funds invested in organizations described in subsection (1)(h) of this section, shall not exceed 10 percent of the assets of the credit union, whichever is less.

   e. A credit union may engage in an activity permitted under this section only with the prior authorization of the director and subject to such requirements, restrictions, or other conditions as the director may adopt by rule, order, directive, standard, policy, memorandum, or other written communication with regard to the activity. In approving or denying a proposed activity, the director shall consider the financial and management strength of the credit union and the relationship of the activity to the credit union's operations.

3. If a credit union has lawfully made an investment that later becomes impermissible because of a change in circumstances or law, and the director finds that this investment will have an adverse effect on the safety and soundness of the credit union, then the director may require that the credit union develop a reasonable plan for the divestiture of the investment.

## 31.12.461 - Mergers.
1. For purposes of this section, a "merging credit union" is a credit union whose charter ceases to exist upon merger with the continuing credit union, and a "continuing credit union" is a credit union whose charter continues upon merger with the merging credit union.

2. A credit union may be merged with another credit union with the approval by the director of a plan of merger or in accordance with requirements the director may otherwise prescribe. The merger must be approved by a majority vote of the board of each credit union and a majority vote of those members of the merging credit union voting on the merger at a membership meeting. The requirement of approval by the members of the merging credit union may be waived by the director if the merging credit union is in imminent danger of insolvency.

3. The property, rights, and interests of the merging credit union transfer to and vest in the continuing credit union without deed, endorsement, or instrument of transfer, although instruments of transfer may be used if their use is deemed appropriate. The debts and obligations of the merging credit union that are known or reasonably should be known are assumed by the continuing credit union.

4. The continuing credit union shall cause to be published notice of merger once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal place of business of the merging credit union is located.

5. The notice of merger must also inform creditors of the merging credit union how to make a claim on the continuing credit union, and that if a claim is not made upon the continuing credit union within thirty days of the last date of publication, creditors' claims that are not known by the continuing credit union are thereafter barred.

6. Except for claims filed as requested by the notice, or debts or obligations that are known or reasonably should be known by the continuing credit union, the debts and obligations of the merging credit union are discharged.

7. Upon merger, the charter of the merging credit union ceases to exist.

8. Mergers are effective after the thirty-day notice period to creditors and all regulatory waiting periods have expired, and upon filing of the credit union's articles of merger by the secretary of state, or a later date stated in the articles, which in no event may be later than ninety days after the articles are filed.

## 31.12.464 - Merger or conversion of state into federal, out-of-state, or foreign credit union, or other type of financial institution.
1. A credit union may merge or convert into a federal credit union as authorized by the federal credit union act.

For all other purposes, the credit union is merged or converted into a federal credit union and the credit union may execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the successor federal credit union the instruments of transfer, conveyance, and assignment that are necessary or desirable to complete the merger or conversion, and the property, tangible or intangible, and all rights, titles, and interests that are agreed to by the board and the federal regulator.

4. Mergers and conversions are effective after all applicable regulatory waiting periods have expired and upon filing of the credit union's articles of merger or articles of conversion, as appropriate, by the secretary of state, or a later date stated in the articles, which in no event may be later than ninety days after the articles are filed.

2. Upon a vote to liquidate under subsection (1) of this section, a three-person liquidating committee must be elected to liquidate the assets of the credit union. The committee shall act in accordance with any requirements of the director and may be reasonably compensated by the board of the credit union. Each share account holder and depositor at the credit union is entitled to his, her, or its proportionate part of the assets in liquidation after all shares, deposits, and debts have been paid.

In case of doubt or conflicting claims, the director may require an order of the superior court of the county in which the principal place of business of the credit union was located, authorizing and directing the payment of the funds. The director may apply the interest earned by the funds toward defraying the expenses incurred in the holding and paying of the funds. Five years after the receipt of the funds, the funds still remaining with the director must be remitted to the state as unclaimed property.

Upon taking possession of the credit union, the receiver shall give written notice to the directors of the credit union and to all persons having possession of any assets of the credit union. No person with knowledge of the taking of possession by the receiver shall have a lien or charge for any payment advanced, clearance made, or liability incurred against any of the assets of the credit union, after the receiver takes possession, unless approved by the receiver.

The director, the department and its employees, and any third-party receiver acting on behalf of the department are not subject to liability for actions taken pursuant to appointment of a receiver under this section. Funds of the department may not be required to be expended on behalf of the credit union or its members, directors, officers, employees, or any other person.

At the hearing, the credit union has the burden to show cause why the director's action ordering involuntary liquidation or appointing a receiver should not be affirmed.

2. The court shall summarily hear and dismiss the complaint if it finds that the order of involuntary liquidation or order appointing receiver was issued for cause. However, if the court finds that no cause existed for the order of involuntary liquidation or order appointing receiver, the court shall require the director to restore the credit union to possession of its assets and enjoin the director from involuntary liquidation of the credit union or further appointment of a receiver for the credit union without cause.

3. Failure of the credit union to serve notice of show cause hearing on the director as required under subsection (1) of this section bars a credit union from any judicial review of a director's order of involuntary liquidation under RCW 31.12.664(2) or of a director's appointment of receiver under RCW 31.12.671.

The receiver may deliver to each purchaser or lender an appropriate deed, mortgage, agreement of pledge, or other instrument of title or security. The receiver may employ an attorney or other assistants to assist in carrying out the receivership, subject to such surety bond as the director may require. The premium for any such bond must be paid out of the assets of the credit union.

In carrying out the receivership, the receiver may without limitation arrange for the merger or consolidation of the credit union in receivership with another credit union, out-of-state credit union, or federal credit union, or may arrange for the purchase of the credit union's assets and the assumption of its liabilities by such a credit union, in whole or in part, or may arrange for such a transaction with another type of financial institution as may be otherwise permitted by law.

Claims of depositors or share account holders may be presented after the expiration of the time fixed in the notice and may be approved by the receiver. If such a claim is approved, the depositor or share account holder is entitled to its proportion of prior liquidation dividends, if sufficient funds are available for it, and will share in the distribution of the remaining assets.

The receiver may approve or reject any claim, but shall serve notice of rejection upon the claimant by mail or personally.
