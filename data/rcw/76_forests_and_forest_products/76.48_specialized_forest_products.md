## 76.48.221 - Effect of RCW  76.48.031 with respect to huckleberries.
1. Nothing in RCW 76.48.031 creates a requirement that a specialized forest products permit is required for an individual to harvest, possess, or transport huckleberries.

2. Compliance with RCW 76.48.031 allows an individual to sell, or offer for sale, raw or unprocessed huckleberries. Possession of a specialized forest products permit does not create a right or privilege to harvest huckleberries. Huckleberries may be harvested only with the permission of the landowner and under the terms and conditions established between the landowner and the harvester.
