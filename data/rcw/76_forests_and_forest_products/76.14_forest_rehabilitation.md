The department shall develop fire protection projects within the high hazard forest area and shall determine the boundaries thereof in accordance with the lands benefited thereby and shall assess one-sixth of the cost of such projects equally upon all forestlands within the project on an acreage basis.

The landowner may by written notice to the department elect to pay his or her assessment on a deferred basis at a rate of ten cents per thousand board feet and/or one cent per Christmas tree when these products are harvested from the lands for commercial use until the assessment plus two percent interest from the date of completion of each project has been paid for each acre. Payments under the deferred plan shall be credited by forty acre tracts and shall be first applied to payment of the assessment against the forty acre tract from which the funds were derived and secondly to other forty acre tracts held and designated by the payor. In the event total ownership is less than forty acres, then payment shall be applied on an undivided basis to the entire areas as to which the assessment remains unpaid. The landowner who elects to pay on deferred basis may pay any unpaid assessment and interest at any time.

## 76.14.090 - Fire protection projects—Notice—Hearing.
Notice of each project, the estimated assessment per acre, and a description of the boundaries thereof shall be given by publication in a local newspaper of general circulation thirty days in advance of commencing work. Any person owning land within the project may within ten days after publication of notice demand a hearing before the department in Olympia and present any reasons why he or she feels the assessment should not be made upon his or her land. Thereafter, the department may change the boundaries of said project to eliminate land from the project which it determines in its discretion will not be benefited by the project.

\[ [2013 c 23 § 233](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5077-S.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%2023%20§%20233); [1988 c 128 § 44](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c128.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20128%20§%2044); [1955 c 171 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1955c171.pdf?cite=1955%20c%20171%20§%206); \]

Errors in assessments may be corrected at any time by the department by certifying them to the treasurer of the county in which the land involved is situated. Upon the collection of such assessments, the county treasurer shall transmit them to the department. Payment on the deferred plan shall be made directly to the department. Such payment must be made by January 31st for any timber or Christmas trees harvested during the previous calendar year and must be accompanied by a statement of the amount of timber or number of Christmas trees harvested and the legal description of the property from which they were harvested. Whenever an owner paying on the deferred plan desires to pay any unpaid balance or portion thereof, he or she may make direct payment to the department.

## 76.14.110 - Fire protection projects—Credit on assessment for private expenditure.
Where the department finds that a portion of the work in any project, except road building, has been done by private expenditures for fire protection purposes only and that the work was not required by other forestry laws having general application, then the department shall appraise the work on the basis of what it would have cost the state and shall credit the amount of the appraisal toward payment of any sums assessed against lands contained in the project and owned by the person or his or her predecessors in title making the expenditure. Such appraisal shall be added to the cost of the project for purposes of determining the general assessment.
