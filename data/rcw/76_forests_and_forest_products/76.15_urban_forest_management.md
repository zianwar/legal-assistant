## 76.15.005 - Finding.
1. Trees and other woody vegetation are a necessary and important part of community environments. Urban and community forests have many values and uses including conserving energy, reducing air and water pollution and soil erosion, contributing to property values, attracting business, reducing glare and noise, providing aesthetic and historical values, providing wood products, and affording comfort and protection for humans and wildlife.

2. As urban and community areas in Washington state grow, the need to plan for, promote, and manage urban and community forests increases. Cities and communities benefit from assistance in developing and maintaining urban and community forestry programs that also address future growth.

3. Assistance and encouragement in the establishment, retention, and enhancement of these forests and trees by local governments, residents, organizations, and professionals are in the interest of the state based on the contributions these forests make in preserving and enhancing the quality of life of Washington's cities, counties, and tribal lands while providing opportunities for economic development.

4. Well-maintained urban forests deliver local air and water quality benefits that can have positive impacts on human health.

5. Increased tree canopy in urban areas can positively impact salmon populations through stormwater management and reduction of stream temperatures, thereby improving critical salmon habitat.

## 76.15.007 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to:

1. Encourage planning for, planting, maintaining, and managing of trees in the state's cities, counties, and tribal lands and maximize the potential of tree and vegetative cover in improving the quality of the environment;

2. Encourage the coordination of activities by state, local agency, and federally recognized tribes, and maximize resident participation in the development and implementation of urban and community forestry-related programs, including through capacity building to facilitate participation from new partners;

3. Foster healthy economic activity for the state's urban and community forestry-related businesses through cooperative and supportive contracts with the private business sector;

4. Facilitate the creation of employment opportunities related to urban and community forestry activities, including opportunities for youth, especially in urban areas, to learn teamwork, resource conservation, environmental appreciation, and job skills;

5. Provide meaningful voluntary opportunities for the state's residents and organizations interested in urban and community forestry activities;

6. Contribute to improved human health through targeted delivery of programs and activities in highly impacted communities with greater health disparities;

7. Contribute to salmon and orca recovery through targeted delivery of programs and activities in regions that include important salmon habitat identified by regional salmon recovery plans.
