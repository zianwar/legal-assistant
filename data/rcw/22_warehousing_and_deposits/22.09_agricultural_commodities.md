## 22.09.090 - Bond requisites—Certificate of deposit or other security—Additional security—Suspension of license for failure to maintain.
1. An applicant for a warehouse or grain dealer license pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall give a bond to the state of Washington executed by the applicant as the principal and by a corporate surety licensed to do business in this state as surety.

2. The bond required under this section for the issuance of a warehouse license shall be in the sum of not less than fifty thousand dollars nor more than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. The department shall, after holding a public hearing, determine the amount that will be required for the warehouse bond which shall be computed at a rate of not less than fifteen cents nor more than thirty cents per bushel multiplied by the number of bushels of licensed commodity storage capacity of the warehouses of the applicant furnishing the bond. The applicant for a warehouse license may give a single bond meeting the requirements of this chapter, and all warehouses operated by the warehouse operator are deemed to be one warehouse for the purpose of the amount of the bond required under this subsection. Any change in the capacity of a warehouse or addition of any new warehouse involving a change in bond liability under this chapter shall be immediately reported to the department.

3. The bond required under this section for the issuance of a grain dealer license shall be in the sum of not less than fifty thousand dollars nor more than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. The department shall, after holding a public hearing, determine the amount that will be required for the dealer bond which shall be computed at a rate not less than six percent nor more than twelve percent of the sales of agricultural commodities purchased by the dealer from producers during the dealer's last completed fiscal year or in the case of a grain dealer who has been engaged in business as a grain dealer less than one year, the estimated aggregate dollar amount to be paid by the dealer to producers for agricultural commodities to be purchased by the dealer during the dealer's first fiscal year.

4. An applicant making application for both a warehouse license and a grain dealer license may satisfy the bonding requirements set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of this section by giving to the state of Washington a single bond for the issuance of both licenses, which bond shall be in the sum of not less than fifty thousand dollars nor more than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. The department shall, after holding a public hearing, determine the amount of the bond which shall be computed at a rate of not less than fifteen cents nor more than thirty cents per bushel multiplied by the number of bushels of licensed commodity storage capacity of the warehouses of the applicant furnishing the bond, or at the rate of not less than six percent nor more than twelve percent of the gross sales of agricultural commodities of the applicant whichever is greater.

5. The bonds required under this chapter shall be approved by the department and shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance by the licensee of the duties imposed upon him or her by this chapter. If a person has applied for warehouse licenses to operate two or more warehouses in this state, the assets applicable to all warehouses, but not the deposits except in case of a station, are subject to the liabilities of each. The total and aggregate liability of the surety for all claims upon the bond is limited to the face amount of the bond.

6. Any person required to submit a bond to the department under this chapter has the option to give the department a certificate of deposit or other security acceptable to the department payable to the director as trustee, in lieu of a bond or a portion thereof. The principal amount of the certificate or other security shall be the same as that required for a surety bond under this chapter or may be in an amount which, when added to the bond, will satisfy the licensee's requirements for a surety bond under this chapter, and the interest thereon shall be made payable to the purchaser of the certificate or other security. The certificate of deposit or other security shall remain on deposit until it is released, canceled, or discharged as provided for by rule of the department. The provisions of this chapter that apply to a bond required under this chapter apply to each certificate of deposit or other security given in lieu of such a bond.

7. The department may, when it has reason to believe that a grain dealer does not have the ability to pay producers for grain purchased, or when it determines that the grain dealer does not have a sufficient net worth to outstanding financial obligations ratio, or when it believes there may be claims made against the bond in excess of the face amount of the bond, require a grain dealer to post an additional bond in a dollar amount deemed appropriate by the department or may require an additional certificate of deposit or other security. The additional bonding or other security may exceed the maximum amount of the bond otherwise required under this chapter. Failure to post the additional bond, certificate of deposit, or other security constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of a license issued under this chapter.

8. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the license of a warehouse operator or grain dealer shall automatically be suspended in accordance with RCW 22.09.100 for failure at any time to have or to maintain a bond, certificate of deposit, or other security or combination thereof in the amount and type required by this chapter. The department shall remove the suspension or issue a license as the case may be, when the required bond, certificate of deposit, or other security has been obtained.

1. Every bond filed with and approved by the department shall without the necessity of periodic renewal remain in force and effect until such time as the warehouse operator or grain dealer license of each principal on the bond is revoked or otherwise canceled.

2. The surety on a bond, as provided in this chapter, shall be released and discharged from all liability to the state, as to a principal whose license is revoked or canceled, which liability accrues after the expiration of thirty days from the effective date of the revocation or cancellation of the license. The surety on a bond under this chapter shall be released and discharged from all liability to the state accruing on the bond after the expiration of ninety days from the date upon which the surety lodges with the department a written request to be released and discharged. Nothing in this section shall operate to relieve, release, or discharge the surety from any liability which accrues before the expiration of the respective thirty or ninety-day period.

## 22.09.361 - Seizure of commodities or warehouse operator's records—Department duties—Warehouse operator's remedies—Expenses and attorneys' fees.
1. Whenever the department, pursuant to court order, seizes and takes possession of all or a portion of special piles and special bins of commodities, all or a portion of commingled commodities in a warehouse owned, operated, or controlled by a warehouse operator, or books, papers, and property of any kind used in connection with the conduct of a warehouse operator's warehouse business, the department shall:

   a. Give written notice of its action to the surety on the bond of the warehouse operator and may notify the holders of record, as shown by the warehouse operator's records, of all warehouse receipts or scale weight tickets issued for commodities, to present their warehouse receipt or other evidence of deposits for inspection, or to account for the same. The department may thereupon cause an audit to be made of the affairs of the warehouse, especially with respect to the commodities in which there is an apparent shortage, to determine the amount of the shortage and compute the shortage as to each depositor as shown by the warehouse operator's records, if practicable. The department shall notify the warehouse operator and the surety on his or her bond of the approximate amount of the shortage and notify each depositor thereby affected by sending notice to the depositor's last known address as shown by the records of the warehouse operator.

   b. Retain possession of the commodities in the warehouse or warehouses, and of the books, papers, and property of the warehouse operator, until the warehouse operator or the surety on the bond has satisfied the claims of all holders of warehouse receipts or other evidence of deposits, or, in case the shortage exceeds the amount of the bond, the surety on the bond has satisfied the claims pro rata.

2. At any time within ten days after the department takes possession of any commodities or the books, papers, and property of any warehouse, the warehouse operator may serve notice upon the department to appear in the superior court of the county in which the warehouse is located, at a time to be fixed by the court, which shall not be less than five nor more than fifteen days from the date of the service of the notice, and show cause why such commodities, books, papers, and property should not be restored to his or her possession.

3. All necessary expenses and attorneys' fees incurred by the department in carrying out the provisions of this section may be recovered in the same action or in a separate civil action brought by the department in the superior court.

4. As a part of the expenses so incurred, the department is authorized to include the cost of adequate liability insurance necessary to protect the department, its officers, and others engaged in carrying out the provisions of this section.

## 22.09.371 - Depositor's lien.
1. When a depositor stores a commodity with a warehouse operator or sells a commodity to a grain dealer, the depositor has a first priority statutory lien on the commodity or the proceeds therefrom or on commodities owned by the warehouse operator or grain dealer if the depositor has written evidence of ownership disclosing a storage obligation or written evidence of sale. The lien arises at the time the title is transferred from the depositor to the warehouse operator or grain dealer, or if the commodity is under a storage obligation, the lien arises at the commencement of the storage obligation. The lien terminates when the liability of the warehouse operator or grain dealer to the depositor terminates or if the depositor sells his or her commodity to the warehouse operator or grain dealer, then thirty days after the date title passes. If, however, the depositor is tendered payment by check or draft, then the lien shall not terminate until forty days after the date title passes.

2. The lien created under this section shall be preferred to any lien or security interest in favor of any creditor of the warehouse operator or grain dealer, regardless of whether the creditor's lien or security interest attached to the commodity or proceeds before or after the date on which the depositor's lien attached under subsection (1) of this section.

3. A depositor who claims a lien under subsection (1) of this section need not file any notice of the lien in order to perfect the lien.

4. The lien created by subsection (1) of this section is discharged, except as to the proceeds therefrom and except as to commodities owned by the warehouse operator or grain dealer, upon sale of the commodity by the warehouse operator or grain dealer to a buyer in the ordinary course of business.

## 22.09.381 - Depositors' claims, processing by department.
In the event of a failure of a grain dealer or warehouse operator, the department may process the claims of depositors possessing written evidence of ownership disclosing a storage obligation or written evidence of a sale of commodities in the following manner:

1. The department shall give notice and provide a reasonable time to depositors possessing written evidence of ownership disclosing a storage obligation or written evidence of sale of commodities to file their claims with the department.

2. The department may investigate each claim and determine whether the claimant's commodities are under a storage obligation or whether a sale of the commodities has occurred. The department may, in writing, notify each claimant and the failed grain dealer or warehouse operator of the department's determination as to the status and amount of each claimant's claim. A claimant, failed warehouse operator, or grain dealer may request a hearing on the department's determination within twenty days of receipt of written notification, and a hearing shall be held in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

3. The department may inspect and audit the failed warehouse operator to determine whether the warehouse operator has in his or her possession sufficient quantities of commodities to cover his or her storage obligations. In the event of a shortage, the department shall determine each depositor's pro rata share of available commodities and the deficiency shall be considered as a claim of the depositor. Each type of commodity shall be treated separately for the purpose of determining shortages.

4. The department shall determine the amount, if any, due each claimant by the surety and make demand upon the bond in the manner set forth in this chapter.

\[ [2011 c 336 § 627](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5045.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20336%20§%20627); [1983 c 305 § 51](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c305.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20305%20§%2051); \]

## 22.09.391 - Depositor's lien—Liquidation procedure.
Upon the failure of a grain dealer or warehouse operator, the statutory lien created in RCW 22.09.371 shall be liquidated by the department to satisfy the claims of depositors in the following manner:

1. The department shall take possession of all commodities in the warehouse, including those owned by the warehouse operator or grain dealer, and those that are under warehouse receipts or any written evidence of ownership that discloses a storage obligation by a failed warehouse operator, including but not limited to scale weight tickets, settlement sheets, and ledger cards. These commodities shall be distributed or sold and the proceeds distributed to satisfy the outstanding warehouse receipts or other written evidences of ownership. If a shortage exists, the department shall distribute the commodities or the proceeds from the sale of the commodities on a prorated basis to the depositors. To the extent the commodities or the proceeds from their sale are inadequate to satisfy the claims of depositors with evidence of storage obligations, the depositors have a first priority lien against any proceeds received from commodities sold while under a storage obligation or against any commodities owned by the failed warehouse operator or grain dealer.

2. Depositors possessing written evidence of the sale of a commodity to the failed warehouse operator or grain dealer, including but not limited to scale weight tickets, settlement sheets, deferred price contracts, or similar commodity delivery contracts, who have completed delivery and passed title during a thirty-day period immediately before the failure of the failed warehouse operator or grain dealer have a second priority lien against the commodity, the proceeds of the sale, or warehouse-owned or grain dealer-owned commodities. If the commodity, commodity proceeds, or warehouse-owned or grain dealer-owned commodities are insufficient to wholly satisfy the claim of depositors possessing written evidence of the sale of the commodity to the failed warehouse operator or grain dealer, each depositor shall receive a pro rata share thereof.

3. Upon the satisfaction of the claims of depositors qualifying for first or second priority treatment, all other depositors possessing written evidence of the sale of the commodity to the failed warehouse operator or grain dealer have a third priority lien against the commodity, the proceeds of the sale, or warehouse-owned or grain dealer-owned commodities. If the commodities, commodity proceeds, or warehouse-owned or grain dealer-owned commodities are insufficient to wholly satisfy these claims, each depositor shall receive a pro rata share thereof.

4. The director of agriculture may represent depositors whom, under RCW 22.09.381, the director has determined have claims against the failed warehouse operator or failed grain dealer in any action brought to enjoin or otherwise contest the distributions made by the director under this section.

## 22.09.431 - Grain indemnity fund program—Additional security.
The department may, when it has reason to believe that a licensee does not have the ability to pay producers for grain purchased, or when it determines that the licensee does not have a sufficient net worth to outstanding financial obligations ratio, require from the licensee the payment of an additional assessment or, at the department's option, the posting of a bond or other additional security in an amount to be prescribed by rule. The additional assessment or other security may exceed the maximum amount set forth in RCW 22.09.416. Failure of the licensee to timely pay the additional assessment or post the additional bond or other security constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of a license issued under this chapter.

No sample shall be deemed to be representative unless it is of the size and procured in accordance with the uniform methods prescribed by the department.

2. An inspection may be made of a submitted sample of a commodity, provided that the certificate issued in such case clearly shows that the inspection or grading covers only the submitted sample of such commodity and not the lot from which it is purportedly drawn.
