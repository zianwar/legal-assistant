## 34.05.001 - Legislative intent.
The legislature intends, by enacting this 1988 Administrative Procedure Act, to clarify the existing law of administrative procedure, to achieve greater consistency with other states and the federal government in administrative procedure, and to provide greater public and legislative access to administrative decision making. The legislature intends that to the greatest extent possible and unless this chapter clearly requires otherwise, current agency practices and court decisions interpreting the Administrative Procedure Act in effect before July 1, 1989, shall remain in effect. The legislature also intends that the courts should interpret provisions of this chapter consistently with decisions of other courts interpreting similar provisions of other states, the federal government, and model acts.

## 34.05.110 - Violations of state law or agency rule by small businesses—Notice requirements—Waiver of penalty for first-time paperwork violations.
1. Agencies must provide to a small business a copy of the state law or agency rule that a small business is violating and a period of at least seven calendar days to correct the violation before the agency may impose any fines, civil penalties, or administrative sanctions for a violation of a state law or agency rule by a small business. If no correction is possible or if an agency is acting in response to a complaint made by a third party and the third party would be disadvantaged by the application of this subsection, the requirements in this subsection do not apply.

2. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, agencies shall waive any fines, civil penalties, or administrative sanctions for first-time paperwork violations by a small business.

3. When an agency waives a fine, penalty, or sanction under this section, when possible it shall require the small business to correct the violation within a reasonable period of time, in a manner specified by the agency. If correction is impossible, no correction may be required and failure to correct is not grounds for reinstatement of fines, penalties, or sanctions under subsection (5)(b) of this section.

4. Exceptions to requirements of subsection (1) of this section and the waiver requirement in subsection (2) of this section may be made for any of the following reasons:

   a.

   b. The violation involves a knowing or willful violation;

   c. The violation is of a requirement concerning the assessment, collection, or administration of any tax, tax program, debt, revenue, receipt, a regulated entity's financial filings, or insurance rate or form filing;

   d. The requirements of this section are in conflict with federal law or program requirements, federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or the requirements for eligibility of employers in this state for federal unemployment tax credits, as determined by the agency head;

   e. The small business committing the violation previously violated a substantially similar requirement; or

   f. The owner or operator of the small business committing the violation owns or operates, or owned or operated a different small business which previously violated a substantially similar requirement.

5. [Empty]

   a. Nothing in this section prohibits an agency from waiving fines, civil penalties, or administrative sanctions incurred by a small business for a paperwork violation that is not a first-time offense.

   b. Any fine, civil penalty, or administrative sanction that is waived under this section may be reinstated and imposed in addition to any additional fines, penalties, or administrative sanctions associated with a subsequent violation for noncompliance with a substantially similar paperwork requirement, or failure to correct the previous violation as required by the agency under subsection (3) of this section.

6. Nothing in this section may be construed to diminish the responsibility for any citizen or business to apply for and obtain a permit, license, or authorizing document that is required to engage in a regulated activity, or otherwise comply with state or federal law.

7. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to small businesses required to provide accurate and complete information and documentation in relation to any claim for payment of state or federal funds or who are licensed or certified to provide care and services to vulnerable adults or children.

8. Nothing in this section affects the attorney general's authority to impose fines, civil penalties, or administrative sanctions as otherwise authorized by law; nor shall this section affect the attorney general's authority to enforce the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

9. As used in this section:

   a. "Small business" means a business with two hundred fifty or fewer employees or a gross revenue of less than seven million dollars annually as reported on its most recent federal income tax return or its most recent return filed with the department of revenue.

   b. "Paperwork violation" means the violation of any statutory or regulatory requirement that mandates the collection of information by an agency, or the collection, posting, or retention of information by a small business. This includes but is not limited to requirements in the Revised Code of Washington, the Washington Administrative Code, the Washington State Register, or any other agency directive.

   c. "First-time paperwork violation" means the first instance of a particular or substantially similar paperwork violation.

## 34.05.120 - Extension of rights and responsibilities—State registered domestic partnerships.
1. Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose, except where inconsistent with federal law or regulations applicable to federal benefit programs, agencies shall amend their rules to reflect the intent of the legislature to ensure that all privileges, immunities, rights, benefits, or responsibilities granted or imposed by statute to an individual because that individual is or was a spouse in a marital relationship are granted or imposed on equivalent terms to an individual because that individual is or was in a state registered domestic partnership.

2. Except where inconsistent with federal law or regulations applicable to federal benefit programs, all agency orders creating new rules, or amending existing rules, shall be formulated to reflect the intent stated in subsection (1) of this section.

5. The code reviser may edit and revise rules for publication, codification, and compilation, without changing the meaning of any such rule.

6. When a rule, in whole or in part, is declared invalid and unconstitutional by a court of final appeal, the adopting agency shall give notice to that effect in the register. With the consent of the attorney general, the code reviser may remove obsolete rules or parts of rules from the Washington Administrative Code when:

   a. The rules are declared unconstitutional by a court of final appeal; or

   b. The adopting agency ceases to exist and the rules are not transferred by statute to a successor agency.

1. In addition to other rule-making requirements imposed by law:

   a. Each agency may adopt rules governing the formal and informal procedures prescribed or authorized by this chapter and rules of practice before the agency, together with forms and instructions. If an agency has not adopted procedural rules under this section, the model rules adopted by the chief administrative law judge under RCW 34.05.250 govern procedures before the agency.

   b. To assist interested persons dealing with it, each agency shall adopt as a rule a description of its organization, stating the general course and method of its operations and the methods whereby the public may obtain information and make submissions or requests. No person may be required to comply with agency procedure not adopted as a rule as herein required.

2. To the extent not prohibited by federal law or regulation, nor prohibited for reasons of confidentiality by state law, each agency shall keep on file for public inspection all final orders, decisions, and opinions in adjudicative proceedings, interpretive statements, policy statements, and any digest or index to those orders, decisions, opinions, or statements prepared by or for the agency.

3. No agency order, decision, or opinion is valid or effective against any person, nor may it be invoked by the agency for any purpose, unless it is available for public inspection. This subsection is not applicable in favor of any person who has actual knowledge of the order, decision, or opinion. The agency has the burden of proving that knowledge, but may meet that burden by proving that the person has been properly served with a copy of the order.

4. Each agency that is authorized by law to exercise discretion in deciding individual cases is encouraged to formalize the general principles that may evolve from these decisions by adopting the principles as rules that the agency will follow until they are amended or repealed.

5. To the extent practicable, any rule proposed or adopted by an agency should be clearly and simply stated, so that it can be understood by those required to comply.

6. The departments of employment security, labor and industries, ecology, and revenue shall develop and use a notification process to communicate information to the public regarding the postadoption notice required by RCW 34.05.362.

## 34.05.230 - Interpretive and policy statements.
1. An agency is encouraged to advise the public of its current opinions, approaches, and likely courses of action by means of interpretive or policy statements. Current interpretive and policy statements are advisory only. To better inform and involve the public, an agency is encouraged to convert long-standing interpretive and policy statements into rules.

2. A person may petition an agency requesting the conversion of interpretive and policy statements into rules. Upon submission, the agency shall notify the joint administrative rules review committee of the petition. Within sixty days after submission of a petition, the agency shall either deny the petition in writing, stating its reasons for the denial, or initiate rule-making proceedings in accordance with this chapter.

3. Each agency shall maintain a roster of interested persons, consisting of persons who have requested in writing to be notified of all interpretive and policy statements issued by that agency. Each agency shall update the roster periodically and eliminate persons who do not indicate a desire to continue on the roster. Whenever an agency issues an interpretive or policy statement, it shall send a copy of the statement to each person listed on the roster. The agency may charge a nominal fee to the interested person for this service.

## 34.05.325 - Public participation—Concise explanatory statement.
1. The agency shall make a good faith effort to insure that the information on the proposed rule published pursuant to RCW 34.05.320 accurately reflects the rule to be presented and considered at the oral hearing on the rule. Written comment about a proposed rule, including supporting data, shall be accepted by an agency if received no later than the time and date specified in the notice, or such later time and date established at the rule-making hearing.

2. The agency shall provide an opportunity for oral comment to be received by the agency in a rule-making hearing.

3. If the agency possesses equipment capable of receiving telefacsimile transmissions or recorded telephonic communications, the agency may provide in its notice of hearing filed under RCW 34.05.320 that interested parties may comment on proposed rules by these means. If the agency chooses to receive comments by these means, the notice of hearing shall provide instructions for making such comments, including, but not limited to, appropriate telephone numbers to be used; the date and time by which comments must be received; required methods to verify the receipt and authenticity of the comments; and any limitations on the number of pages for telefacsimile transmission comments and on the minutes of tape recorded comments. The agency shall accept comments received by these means for inclusion in the official record if the comments are made in accordance with the agency's instructions.

4. The agency head, a member of the agency head, or a presiding officer designated by the agency head shall preside at the rule-making hearing. Rule-making hearings shall be open to the public. The agency shall cause a record to be made of the hearing by stenographic, mechanical, or electronic means. Regardless of whether the agency head has delegated rule-making authority, the presiding official shall prepare a memorandum for consideration by the agency head, summarizing the contents of the presentations made at the rule-making hearing, unless the agency head presided or was present at substantially all of the hearings. The summarizing memorandum is a public document and shall be made available to any person in accordance with chapter 42.56 RCW.

5. Rule-making hearings are legislative in character and shall be reasonably conducted by the presiding official to afford interested persons the opportunity to present comment individually. All comments by all persons shall be made in the presence and hearing of other attendees. Written or electronic submissions may be accepted and included in the record. Rule-making hearings may be continued to a later time and place established on the record without publication of further notice under RCW 34.05.320.

2. The following factors shall be considered in determining whether an adopted rule is substantially different from the proposed rule on which it is based:

   a. The extent to which a reasonable person affected by the adopted rule would have understood that the published proposed rule would affect his or her interests;

   b. The extent to which the subject of the adopted rule or the issues determined in it are substantially different from the subject or issues involved in the published proposed rule; and

   c. The extent to which the effects of the adopted rule differ from the effects of the published proposed rule.

3. If the agency, without filing a supplemental notice under subsection (1) of this section, adopts a rule that varies in content from the proposed rule, the general subject matter of the adopted rule must remain the same as the proposed rule. The agency shall briefly describe any changes, other than editing changes, and the principal reasons for adopting the changes. The brief description shall be filed with the code reviser together with the order of adoption for publication in the state register. Within sixty days of publication of the adopted rule in the state register, any interested person may petition the agency to amend any portion of the adopted rule that is substantially different from the proposed rule. The petition shall briefly demonstrate how the adopted rule is substantially different from the proposed rule and shall contain the text of the petitioner's proposed amendment. For purposes of the petition, an adopted rule is substantially different if the issues determined in the adopted rule differ from the issues determined in the proposed rule or the anticipated effects of the adopted rule differ from those of the proposed rule. If the petition meets the requirements of this subsection and RCW 34.05.330, the agency shall initiate rule-making proceedings upon the proposed amendments within the time provided in RCW 34.05.330.

## 34.05.345 - Failure to give twenty days notice of intended action—Effect.
Except for emergency rules adopted under RCW 34.05.350, when twenty days notice of intended action to adopt, amend, or repeal a rule has not been published in the state register, as required by RCW 34.05.320, the code reviser shall not publish such rule and such rule shall not be effective for any purpose.

\[ [1988 c 288 § 308](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20308); [1967 c 237 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c237.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20237%20§%204); \]

## 34.05.350 - Emergency rules and amendments.
1. If an agency for good cause finds:

   a. That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest;

   b. That state or federal law or federal rule or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule; or

   c. In order to implement the requirements or reductions in appropriations enacted in any budget for fiscal year 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, or in an omnibus transportation appropriations act for the 2021-2023 biennium related to setting toll rates or ferry fares, which necessitates the need for the immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the fiscal needs or requirements of the agency,

the agency may dispense with those requirements and adopt, amend, or repeal the rule on an emergency basis. The agency's finding and a concise statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the order for adoption of the emergency rule or amendment filed with the office of the code reviser under RCW 34.05.380 and with the rules review committee.

2. An emergency rule adopted under this section takes effect upon filing with the code reviser, unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption, and may not remain in effect for longer than one hundred twenty days after filing. Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that its permanent rules be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective.

3. Within seven days after the rule is adopted, any person may petition the governor requesting the immediate repeal of a rule adopted on an emergency basis by any department listed in RCW 43.17.010. Within seven days after submission of the petition, the governor shall either deny the petition in writing, stating his or her reasons for the denial, or order the immediate repeal of the rule. In ruling on the petition, the governor shall consider only whether the conditions in subsection (1) of this section were met such that adoption of the rule on an emergency basis was necessary. If the governor orders the repeal of the emergency rule, any sanction imposed based on that rule is void. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit adoption of any rule as a permanent rule.

## 34.05.353 - Expedited rule making.
1. An agency may file notice for the expedited adoption of rules in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section for rules meeting any one of the following criteria:

   a. The proposed rules relate only to internal governmental operations that are not subject to violation by a person;

   b. The proposed rules adopt or incorporate by reference without material change federal statutes or regulations, Washington state statutes, rules of other Washington state agencies, shoreline master programs other than those programs governing shorelines of statewide significance, or, as referenced by Washington state law, national consensus codes that generally establish industry standards, if the material adopted or incorporated regulates the same subject matter and conduct as the adopting or incorporating rule;

   c. The proposed rules only correct typographical errors, make address or name changes, or clarify language of a rule without changing its effect;

   d. The content of the proposed rules is explicitly and specifically dictated by statute;

   e. The proposed rules have been the subject of negotiated rule making, pilot rule making, or some other process that involved substantial participation by interested parties before the development of the proposed rule; or

   f. The proposed rule is being amended after a review under RCW 34.05.328.

2. An agency may file notice for the expedited repeal of rules under the procedures set forth in this section for rules meeting any one of the following criteria:

   a. The statute on which the rule is based has been repealed and has not been replaced by another statute providing statutory authority for the rule;

   b. The statute on which the rule is based has been declared unconstitutional by a court with jurisdiction, there is a final judgment, and no statute has been enacted to replace the unconstitutional statute;

   c. The rule is no longer necessary because of changed circumstances; or

   d. Other rules of the agency or of another agency govern the same activity as the rule, making the rule redundant.

3. The expedited rule-making process must follow the requirements for rule making set forth in RCW 34.05.320, except that the agency is not required to prepare a small business economic impact statement under RCW 19.85.025, a statement indicating whether the rule constitutes a significant legislative rule under RCW 34.05.328(5)(c)(iii), or a significant legislative rule analysis under RCW 34.05.328. An agency is not required to prepare statements of inquiry under RCW 34.05.310 or conduct a hearing for the expedited rule making. The notice for the expedited rule making must contain a statement in at least ten-point type, that is substantially in the following form:

NOTICE

THIS RULE IS BEING PROPOSED UNDER AN EXPEDITED RULE-MAKING PROCESS THAT WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THE AGENCY TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS, PREPARE A SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT, OR PROVIDE RESPONSES TO THE CRITERIA FOR A SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE RULE. IF YOU OBJECT TO THIS USE OF THE EXPEDITED RULE-MAKING PROCESS, YOU MUST EXPRESS YOUR OBJECTIONS IN WRITING AND THEY MUST BE SENT TO (INSERT NAME AND ADDRESS) AND RECEIVED BY (INSERT DATE).

4. The agency shall send either a copy of the notice of the proposed expedited rule making, or a summary of the information on the notice, to any person who has requested notification of proposals for expedited rule making or of regular agency rule making, as well as the joint administrative rules review committee, within three days after its publication in the Washington State Register. An agency may charge for the actual cost of providing a requesting party mailed copies of these notices. The notice of the proposed expedited rule making must be preceded by a statement substantially in the form provided in subsection (3) of this section. The notice must also include an explanation of the reasons the agency believes the expedited rule-making process is appropriate.

5. The code reviser shall publish the text of all rules proposed for expedited adoption, and the citation and caption of all rules proposed for expedited repeal, along with the notice required in this section in a separate section of the Washington State Register. Once the notice of expedited rule making has been published in the Washington State Register, the only changes that an agency may make in the noticed materials before their final adoption or repeal are to correct typographical errors.

6. Any person may file a written objection to the expedited rule making. The objection must be filed with the agency rules coordinator within forty-five days after the notice of the proposed expedited rule making has been published in the Washington State Register. A person who has filed a written objection to the expedited rule making may withdraw the objection.

7. If no written objections to the expedited rule making are filed with the agency within forty-five days after the notice of proposed expedited rule making is published, or if all objections that have been filed are withdrawn by the persons filing the objections, the agency may enter an order adopting or repealing the rule without further notice or a public hearing. The order must be published in the manner required by this chapter for any other agency order adopting, amending, or repealing a rule.

8. If a written notice of objection to the expedited rule making is timely filed with the agency and is not withdrawn, the notice of proposed expedited rule making published under this section is considered a statement of inquiry for the purposes of RCW 34.05.310, and the agency may initiate further rule-making proceedings in accordance with this chapter.

9. As used in this section, "expedited rule making" includes both the expedited adoption of rules and the expedited repeal of rules.

## 34.05.360 - Order adopting rule, contents.
The order of adoption by which each rule is adopted by an agency shall contain all of the following:

1. The date the agency adopted the rule;

2. A concise statement of the purpose of the rule;

3. A reference to all rules repealed, amended, or suspended by the rule;

4. A reference to the specific statutory or other authority authorizing adoption of the rule;

5. Any findings required by any provision of law as a precondition to adoption or effectiveness of the rule; and

6. The effective date of the rule if other than that specified in RCW 34.05.380(2).

## 34.05.362 - Postadoption notice.
Either before or within two hundred days after the effective date of an adopted rule that imposes additional requirements on businesses the violation of which subjects the business to a penalty, assessment, or administrative sanction, an agency identified in RCW 34.05.220(6) shall notify businesses affected by the rule of the requirements of the rule and how to obtain technical assistance to comply. Notification must be provided by email, if possible, to every person identified to receive the postadoption notice under RCW 34.05.220(6).

The notification must announce the rule change, briefly summarize the rule change, refer to appeal procedures under RCW 34.05.330, and include a contact for more information. Failure to notify a specific business under this section does not invalidate a rule or waive the requirement to comply with the rule. The requirements of this section do not apply to emergency rules adopted under RCW 34.05.350.

## 34.05.365 - Incorporation by reference.
An agency may incorporate by reference and without publishing the incorporated matter in full, all or any part of a code, standard, rule, or regulation that has been adopted by an agency of the United States, of this state, or of another state, by a political subdivision of this state, or by a generally recognized organization or association if incorporation of the full text in the agency rules would be unduly cumbersome, expensive, or otherwise inexpedient. The reference in agency rules shall fully identify the incorporated matter. An agency may incorporate by reference such matter in its rules only if the agency, organization, or association originally issuing that matter makes copies readily available to the public. The incorporating agency shall have, maintain, and make available for public inspection a copy of the incorporated matter. The rule must state where copies of the incorporated matter are available.

\[ [1988 c 288 § 312](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20312); \]

## 34.05.370 - Rule-making file.
1. Each agency shall maintain an official rule-making file for each rule that it (a) proposes by publication in the state register, or (b) adopts. The file and materials incorporated by reference shall be available for public inspection.

2. The agency rule-making file shall contain all of the following:

   a. A list of citations to all notices in the state register with respect to the rule or the proceeding upon which the rule is based;

   b. Copies of any portions of the agency's public rule-making docket containing entries relating to the rule or the proceeding on which the rule is based;

   c. All written petitions, requests, submissions, and comments received by the agency and all other written material regarded by the agency as important to adoption of the rule or the proceeding on which the rule is based;

   d. Any official transcript of oral presentations made in the proceeding on which the rule is based or, if not transcribed, any tape recording or stenographic record of them, and any memorandum prepared by a presiding official summarizing the contents of those presentations;

   e. All petitions for exceptions to, amendment of, or repeal or suspension of, the rule;

   f. Citations to data, factual information, studies, or reports on which the agency relies in the adoption of the rule, indicating where such data, factual information, studies, or reports are available for review by the public, but this subsection (2)(f) does not require the agency to include in the rule-making file any data, factual information, studies, or reports gathered pursuant to chapter 19.85 RCW or RCW 34.05.328 that can be identified to a particular business;

   g. The concise explanatory statement required by RCW 34.05.325(6); and

   h. Any other material placed in the file by the agency.

3. Internal agency documents are exempt from inclusion in the rule-making file under subsection (2) of this section to the extent they constitute preliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, and intra-agency memoranda in which opinions are expressed or policies formulated or recommended, except that a specific document is not exempt from inclusion when it is publicly cited by an agency in connection with its decision.

4. Upon judicial review, the file required by this section constitutes the official agency rule-making file with respect to that rule. Unless otherwise required by another provision of law, the official agency rule-making file need not be the exclusive basis for agency action on that rule.

## 34.05.375 - Substantial compliance with procedures.
No rule proposed after July 1, 1989, is valid unless it is adopted in substantial compliance with RCW 34.05.310 through 34.05.395. Inadvertent failure to mail notice of a proposed rule adoption to any person as required by RCW 34.05.320(3) does not invalidate a rule. No action based upon this section may be maintained to contest the validity of any rule unless it is commenced within two years after the effective date of the rule.

\[ [1988 c 288 § 314](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20314); \]

## 34.05.380 - Filing with code reviser—Written record—Effective dates.
1. Each agency shall file in the office of the code reviser a certified copy of all rules it adopts, except for rules contained in tariffs filed with or published by the Washington utilities and transportation commission. The code reviser shall place upon each rule a notation of the time and date of filing and shall keep a permanent written record of filed rules open to public inspection. In filing a rule, each agency shall use the standard form prescribed for this purpose by the code reviser.

2. Emergency rules adopted under RCW 34.05.350 become effective upon filing unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption. All other rules become effective upon the expiration of thirty days after the date of filing, unless a later date is required by statute or specified in the order of adoption.

3. A rule may become effective immediately upon its filing with the code reviser or on any subsequent date earlier than that established by subsection (2) of this section, if the agency establishes that effective date in the adopting order and finds that:

   a. Such action is required by the state or federal Constitution, a statute, or court order;

   b. The rule only delays the effective date of another rule that is not yet effective; or

   c. The earlier effective date is necessary because of imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare.

The finding and a brief statement of the reasons therefor required by this subsection shall be made a part of the order adopting the rule.

4. With respect to a rule made effective pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, each agency shall make reasonable efforts to make the effective date known to persons who may be affected by it.

## 34.05.390 - Style, format, and numbering—Agency compliance.
After the rules of an agency have been published by the code reviser:

1. All agency orders amending or rescinding such rules, or creating new rules, shall be formulated in accordance with the style, format, and numbering system of the Washington Administrative Code;

2. Any subsequent printing or reprinting of such rules shall be printed in the style and format (including the numbering system) of such code; and

3. Amendments of previously adopted rules shall incorporate any editorial corrections made by the code reviser.

\[ [1988 c 288 § 317](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20317); [1967 c 237 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967c237.pdf?cite=1967%20c%20237%20§%2014); \]

## 34.05.395 - Format and style of amendatory and new sections—Failure to comply.
1. Rules proposed or adopted by an agency pursuant to this chapter that amend existing sections of the administrative code shall have the words which are amendatory to such existing sections underlined. Any matter to be deleted from an existing section shall be indicated by setting such matter forth in full, enclosed by double parentheses, and such deleted matter shall be lined out with hyphens. A new section shall be designated "NEW SECTION" in upper case type and such designation shall be underlined, but the complete text of the section shall not be underlined. No rule may be forwarded by any agency to the code reviser, nor may the code reviser accept for filing any rule unless the format of such rule is in compliance with the provisions of this section.

2. Once the rule has been formally adopted by the agency the code reviser need not, except with regard to the register published pursuant to RCW 34.05.210(3), include the items enumerated in subsection (1) of this section in the official code.

3. Any addition to or deletion from an existing code section not filed by the agency in the style prescribed by subsection (1) of this section shall in all respects be ineffectual, and shall not be shown in subsequent publications or codifications of that section unless the ineffectual portion of the rule is clearly distinguished and an explanatory note is appended thereto by the code reviser in accordance with RCW 34.05.210.

## 34.05.410 - Application of Part IV.
1. Adjudicative proceedings are governed by RCW 34.05.413 through 34.05.476, except as otherwise provided:

   a. By a rule that adopts the procedures for brief adjudicative proceedings in accordance with the standards provided in RCW 34.05.482 for those proceedings;

   b. By RCW 34.05.479 pertaining to emergency adjudicative proceedings; or

   c. By RCW 34.05.240 pertaining to declaratory proceedings.

## 34.05.413 - Commencement—When required.
1. Within the scope of its authority, an agency may commence an adjudicative proceeding at any time with respect to a matter within the agency's jurisdiction.

2. When required by law or constitutional right, and upon the timely application of any person, an agency shall commence an adjudicative proceeding.

3. An agency may provide forms for and, by rule, may provide procedures for filing an application for an adjudicative proceeding. An agency may require by rule that an application be in writing and that it be filed at a specific address, in a specified manner, and within specified time limits. The agency shall allow at least twenty days to apply for an adjudicative proceeding from the time notice is given of the opportunity to file such an application.

3. When a licensee has made timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a license or a new license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature, an existing full, temporary, or provisional license does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency, and, in case the application is denied or the terms of the new license limited, until the last day for seeking review of the agency order or a later date fixed by order of the reviewing court.

4. If the agency finds that public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, summary suspension of a license may be ordered pending proceedings for revocation or other action. These proceedings must be promptly instituted and determined.

5. This section does not apply to requests made by the department of revenue, under the authority of RCW 82.08.155, to the *liquor control board to suspend a person's spirits license and to refuse to renew any spirits license held by the person and to issue any new spirits license to the person.

## 34.05.440 - Default.
1. Failure of a party to file an application for an adjudicative proceeding within the time limit or limits established by statute or agency rule constitutes a default and results in the loss of that party's right to an adjudicative proceeding, and the agency may proceed to resolve the case without further notice to, or hearing for the benefit of, that party, except that any default or other dispositive order affecting that party shall be served upon him or her or upon his or her attorney, if any.

2. If a party fails to attend or participate in a hearing or other stage of an adjudicative proceeding, other than failing to timely request an adjudicative proceeding as set out in subsection (1) of this section, the presiding officer may serve upon all parties a default or other dispositive order, which shall include a statement of the grounds for the order.

   a. Limiting the intervenor's participation to designated issues in which the intervenor has a particular interest demonstrated by the petition; and

   b. Limiting the intervenor's use of discovery, cross-examination, and other procedures so as to promote the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings; and

## 34.05.446 - Subpoenas, discovery, and protective orders.
1. The presiding officer may issue subpoenas and may enter protective orders. A subpoena may be issued with like effect by the agency or the attorney of record in whose behalf the witness is required to appear.

2. An agency may by rule determine whether or not discovery is to be available in adjudicative proceedings and, if so, which forms of discovery may be used.

3. Except as otherwise provided by agency rules, the presiding officer may decide whether to permit the taking of depositions, the requesting of admissions, and all other procedures authorized by rules 26 through 36 of the superior court civil rules. The presiding officer may condition use of discovery on a showing of necessity and unavailability by other means. In exercising such discretion, the presiding officer shall consider: (a) Whether all parties are represented by counsel; (b) whether undue expense or delay in bringing the case to hearing will result; (c) whether the discovery will promote the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceeding; and (d) whether the interests of justice will be promoted.

4. Discovery orders and protective orders entered under this section may be enforced under the provisions of this chapter on civil enforcement of agency action.

5. Subpoenas issued under this section may be enforced under RCW 34.05.588(1).

6. The subpoena powers created by this section shall be statewide in effect.

In the discretion of the presiding officer, and where the rights of the parties will not be prejudiced thereby, all or part of the hearing may be conducted by telephone, television, or other electronic means.

4. The presiding officer shall cause the hearing to be recorded by a method chosen by the agency. The agency is not required, at its expense, to prepare a transcript, unless required to do so by a provision of law. Any party, at the party's expense, may cause a reporter approved by the agency to prepare a transcript from the agency's record, or cause additional recordings to be made during the hearing if the making of the additional recording does not cause distraction or disruption.

5. The hearing is open to public observation, except for the parts that the presiding officer states to be closed under a provision of law expressly authorizing closure or under a protective order entered by the presiding officer pursuant to applicable rules. A presiding officer may order the exclusion of witnesses upon a showing of good cause. To the extent that the hearing is conducted by telephone, television, or other electronic means, and is not closed, the availability of public observation is satisfied by giving members of the public an opportunity, at reasonable times, to hear or inspect the agency's record, and to inspect any transcript obtained by the agency.

## 34.05.452 - Rules of evidence—Cross-examination.
1. Evidence, including hearsay evidence, is admissible if in the judgment of the presiding officer it is the kind of evidence on which reasonably prudent persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of their affairs. The presiding officer shall exclude evidence that is excludable on constitutional or statutory grounds or on the basis of evidentiary privilege recognized in the courts of this state. The presiding officer may exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.

2. If not inconsistent with subsection (1) of this section, the presiding officer shall refer to the Washington Rules of Evidence as guidelines for evidentiary rulings.

3. All testimony of parties and witnesses shall be made under oath or affirmation.

4. Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts, or by incorporation by reference.

   c. [(iii)] Presiding officers may communicate with other employees or consultants of the agency who have not participated in the proceeding in any manner, and who are not engaged in any investigative or prosecutorial functions in the same or a factually related case.

   d. [(b)] This subsection does not apply to communications required for the disposition of ex parte matters specifically authorized by statute.

2. Unless required for the disposition of ex parte matters specifically authorized by statute or unless necessary to procedural aspects of maintaining an orderly process, a presiding officer may not communicate, directly or indirectly, regarding any issue in the proceeding, with any person not employed by the agency who has a direct or indirect interest in the outcome of the proceeding, without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate.

3. Unless necessary to procedural aspects of maintaining an orderly process, persons to whom a presiding officer may not communicate under subsections (1) and (2) of this section may not communicate with presiding officers without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate.

4. If, before serving as presiding officer in an adjudicative proceeding, a person receives an ex parte communication of a type that could not properly be received while serving, the person, promptly after starting to serve, shall disclose the communication in the manner prescribed in subsection (5) of this section.

5. A presiding officer who receives an ex parte communication in violation of this section shall place on the record of the pending matter all written communications received, all written responses to the communications, and a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications received, all responses made, and the identity of each person from whom the presiding officer received an ex parte communication. The presiding officer shall advise all parties that these matters have been placed on the record. Upon request made within ten days after notice of the ex parte communication, any party desiring to rebut the communication shall be allowed to place a written rebuttal statement on the record. Portions of the record pertaining to ex parte communications or rebuttal statements do not constitute evidence of any fact at issue in the matter unless a party moves the admission of any portion of the record for purposes of establishing a fact at issue and that portion is admitted pursuant to RCW 34.05.452.

6. If necessary to eliminate the effect of an ex parte communication received in violation of this section, a presiding officer who receives the communication may be disqualified, and the portions of the record pertaining to the communication may be sealed by protective order.

2. A person, including an agency head, who has participated in a determination of probable cause or other equivalent preliminary determination in an adjudicative proceeding may serve as presiding officer or assist or advise a presiding officer in the same proceeding unless a party demonstrates grounds for disqualification in accordance with RCW 34.05.425.

3. A person may serve as presiding officer at successive stages of the same adjudicative proceeding unless a party demonstrates grounds for disqualification in accordance with RCW 34.05.425.

## 34.05.461 - Entry of orders.
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section:

   a. If the presiding officer is the agency head or one or more members of the agency head, the presiding officer may enter an initial order if further review is available within the agency, or a final order if further review is not available;

   b. If the presiding officer is a person designated by the agency to make the final decision and enter the final order, the presiding officer shall enter a final order; and

   c. If the presiding officer is one or more administrative law judges, the presiding officer shall enter an initial order.

2. With respect to agencies exempt from chapter 34.12 RCW or an institution of higher education, the presiding officer shall transmit a full and complete record of the proceedings, including such comments upon demeanor of witnesses as the presiding officer deems relevant, to each agency official who is to enter a final or initial order after considering the record and evidence so transmitted.

3. Initial and final orders shall include a statement of findings and conclusions, and the reasons and basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, including the remedy or sanction and, if applicable, the action taken on a petition for a stay of effectiveness. Any findings based substantially on credibility of evidence or demeanor of witnesses shall be so identified. Findings set forth in language that is essentially a repetition or paraphrase of the relevant provision of law shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying evidence of record to support the findings. The order shall also include a statement of the available procedures and time limits for seeking reconsideration or other administrative relief. An initial order shall include a statement of any circumstances under which the initial order, without further notice, may become a final order.

4. Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence of record in the adjudicative proceeding and on matters officially noticed in that proceeding. Findings shall be based on the kind of evidence on which reasonably prudent persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of their affairs. Findings may be based on such evidence even if it would be inadmissible in a civil trial. However, the presiding officer shall not base a finding exclusively on such inadmissible evidence unless the presiding officer determines that doing so would not unduly abridge the parties' opportunities to confront witnesses and rebut evidence. The basis for this determination shall appear in the order.

## 34.05.464 - Review of initial orders.
1. As authorized by law, an agency may by rule provide that initial orders in specified classes of cases may become final without further agency action unless, within a specified period, (a) the agency head upon its own motion determines that the initial order should be reviewed, or (b) a party to the proceedings files a petition for administrative review of the initial order. Upon occurrence of either event, notice shall be given to all parties to the proceeding.

2. As authorized by law, an agency head may appoint a person to review initial orders and to prepare and enter final agency orders.

3. RCW 34.05.425 and 34.05.455 apply to any person reviewing an initial order on behalf of an agency as part of the decision process, and to persons communicating with them, to the same extent that it is applicable to presiding officers.

4. The officer reviewing the initial order (including the agency head reviewing an initial order) is, for the purposes of this chapter, termed the reviewing officer. The reviewing officer shall exercise all the decision-making power that the reviewing officer would have had to decide and enter the final order had the reviewing officer presided over the hearing, except to the extent that the issues subject to review are limited by a provision of law or by the reviewing officer upon notice to all the parties. In reviewing findings of fact by presiding officers, the reviewing officers shall give due regard to the presiding officer's opportunity to observe the witnesses.

5. The reviewing officer shall personally consider the whole record or such portions of it as may be cited by the parties.

6. The reviewing officer shall afford each party an opportunity to present written argument and may afford each party an opportunity to present oral argument.

Upon remanding a matter, the reviewing officer shall order such temporary relief as is authorized and appropriate.

8. A final order shall include, or incorporate by reference to the initial order, all matters required by RCW 34.05.461(3).

9. The reviewing officer shall cause copies of the final order or order remanding the matter for further proceedings to be served upon each party.

## 34.05.467 - Stay.
A party may submit to the presiding or reviewing officer, as is appropriate to the stage of the proceeding, a petition for stay of effectiveness of a final order within ten days of its service unless otherwise provided by statute or stated in the final order. Disposition of the petition for stay shall be made by the presiding officer, reviewing officer, or agency head as provided by agency rule. Disposition may be made either before or after the effective date of the final order. Disposition denying a stay is not subject to judicial review.

\[ [1988 c 288 § 420](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20420); \]

2. No petition for reconsideration may stay the effectiveness of an order.

3. If a petition for reconsideration is timely filed, and the petitioner has complied with the agency's procedural rules for reconsideration, if any, the time for filing a petition for judicial review does not commence until the agency disposes of the petition for reconsideration. The agency is deemed to have denied the petition for reconsideration if, within twenty days from the date the petition is filed, the agency does not either: (a) Dispose of the petition; or (b) serve the parties with a written notice specifying the date by which it will act on the petition.

4. Unless the petition for reconsideration is deemed denied under subsection (3) of this section, the petition shall be disposed of by the same person or persons who entered the order, if reasonably available. The disposition shall be in the form of a written order denying the petition, granting the petition and dissolving or modifying the final order, or granting the petition and setting the matter for further hearing.

5. The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite for seeking judicial review. An order denying reconsideration, or a notice provided for in subsection (3)(b) of this section is not subject to judicial review.

\[ [1989 c 175 § 21](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c175.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20175%20§%2021); [1988 c 288 § 421](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20421); \]

## 34.05.473 - Effectiveness of orders.

   a. A party may not be required to comply with a final order unless the party has been served with or has actual knowledge of the final order;

   b. A nonparty may not be required to comply with a final order unless the agency has made the final order available for public inspection and copying or the nonparty has actual knowledge of the final order;

   c. For purposes of determining time limits for further administrative procedure or for judicial review, the determinative date is the date of service of the order.

2. Unless a later date is stated in the initial order or a stay is granted, the time when an initial order becomes a final order in accordance with RCW 34.05.461 is determined as follows:

   a. When the initial order is entered, if administrative review is unavailable; or

   b. When the agency head with such authority enters an order stating, after a petition for administrative review has been filed, that review will not be exercised.

3. This section does not preclude an agency from taking immediate action to protect the public interest in accordance with RCW 34.05.479.

\[ [1989 c 175 § 22](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c175.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20175%20§%2022); [1988 c 288 § 422](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20422); \]

## 34.05.479 - Emergency adjudicative proceedings.
1. Unless otherwise provided by law, an agency may use emergency adjudicative proceedings in a situation involving an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requiring immediate agency action.

2. The agency may take only such action as is necessary to prevent or avoid the immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare that justifies use of emergency adjudication.

3. The agency shall enter an order, including a brief statement of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and policy reasons for the decision if it is an exercise of the agency's discretion, to justify the determination of an immediate danger and the agency's decision to take the specific action.

A person may file a petition for judicial review under this chapter only after exhausting all administrative remedies available within the agency whose action is being challenged, or available within any other agency authorized to exercise administrative review, except:

1. A petitioner for judicial review of a rule need not have participated in the rule-making proceeding upon which that rule is based, have petitioned for its amendment or repeal, have petitioned the joint administrative rules review committee for its review, or have appealed a petition for amendment or repeal to the governor;

2. A petitioner for judicial review need not exhaust administrative remedies to the extent that this chapter or any other statute states that exhaustion is not required; or

3. The court may relieve a petitioner of the requirement to exhaust any or all administrative remedies upon a showing that:

   a. The remedies would be patently inadequate;

   b. The exhaustion of remedies would be futile; or

   c. The grave irreparable harm that would result from having to exhaust administrative remedies would clearly outweigh the public policy requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies.

3. A petition for judicial review of agency action other than the adoption of a rule or the entry of an order is not timely unless filed with the court and served on the agency, the office of the attorney general, and all other parties of record within thirty days after the agency action, but the time is extended during any period that the petitioner did not know and was under no duty to discover or could not reasonably have discovered that the agency had taken the action or that the agency action had a sufficient effect to confer standing upon the petitioner to obtain judicial review under this chapter.

4. Service of the petition on the agency shall be by delivery of a copy of the petition to the office of the director, or other chief administrative officer or chairperson of the agency, at the principal office of the agency. Service of a copy by mail upon the other parties of record and the office of the attorney general shall be deemed complete upon deposit in the United States mail, as evidenced by the postmark.

5. Failure to timely serve a petition on the office of the attorney general is not grounds for dismissal of the petition.

6. For purposes of this section, service upon the attorney of record of any agency or party of record constitutes service upon the agency or party of record.

\[ [1998 c 186 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6172.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20186%20§%201); [1988 c 288 § 509](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20509); \]

      ii. Agency action occurring after the person exhausted the last feasible opportunity for seeking relief from the agency.

2. The court shall remand to the agency for determination any issue that is properly raised pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

\[ [1988 c 288 § 512](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20512); \]

## 34.05.558 - Judicial review of facts confined to record.
Judicial review of disputed issues of fact shall be conducted by the court without a jury and must be confined to the agency record for judicial review as defined by this chapter, supplemented by additional evidence taken pursuant to this chapter.

## 34.05.562 - New evidence taken by court or agency.
1. The court may receive evidence in addition to that contained in the agency record for judicial review, only if it relates to the validity of the agency action at the time it was taken and is needed to decide disputed issues regarding:

   b. Unlawfulness of procedure or of decision-making process; or

   c. Material facts in rule making, brief adjudications, or other proceedings not required to be determined on the agency record.

2. The court may remand a matter to the agency, before final disposition of a petition for review, with directions that the agency conduct fact-finding and other proceedings the court considers necessary and that the agency take such further action on the basis thereof as the court directs, if:

   a. The agency was required by this chapter or any other provision of law to base its action exclusively on a record of a type reasonably suitable for judicial review, but the agency failed to prepare or preserve an adequate record;

   b. The court finds that (i) new evidence has become available that relates to the validity of the agency action at the time it was taken, that one or more of the parties did not know and was under no duty to discover or could not have reasonably been discovered until after the agency action, and (ii) the interests of justice would be served by remand to the agency;

   c. The agency improperly excluded or omitted evidence from the record; or

2. If part of the record has been preserved without a transcript, the agency shall prepare a transcript for inclusion in the record transmitted to the court, except for portions that the parties stipulate to omit in accordance with subsection (4) of this section.

3. The agency may charge a nonindigent petitioner with the reasonable costs of preparing any necessary copies and transcripts for transmittal to the court. A failure by the petitioner to pay any of this cost to the agency relieves the agency from the responsibility for preparation of the record and transmittal to the court.

4. The record may be shortened, summarized, or organized temporarily or, by stipulation of all parties, permanently.

5. The court may tax the cost of preparing transcripts and copies of the record:

7. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.

   b. [Empty]

      i. The validity of any rule may be determined upon petition for a declaratory judgment addressed to the superior court of Thurston county, when it appears that the rule, or its threatened application, interferes with or impairs or immediately threatens to interfere with or impair the legal rights or privileges of the petitioner.

      ii. From June 10, 2004, until July 1, 2008:

          A.  If the petitioner's residence or principal place of business is within the geographical boundaries of the third division of the court of appeals as defined by RCW 2.06.020(3), the petition may be filed in the superior court of Spokane, Yakima, or Thurston county; and

          B.  If the petitioner's residence or principal place of business is within the geographical boundaries of district three of the first division of the court of appeals as defined by RCW 2.06.020(1), the petition may be filed in the superior court of Whatcom or Thurston county.

3. Review of agency orders in adjudicative proceedings. The court shall grant relief from an agency order in an adjudicative proceeding only if it determines that:

Within twenty days after service of the petition for review, the agency shall file and serve an answer to the petition, made in the same manner as an answer to a complaint in a civil action. The court may hear evidence, pursuant to RCW 34.05.562, on material issues of fact raised by the petition and answer.

   c. Relief for persons aggrieved by the performance of an agency action, including the exercise of discretion, or an action under (b) of this subsection can be granted only if the court determines that the action is:

      i. Unconstitutional;

      ii. Outside the statutory authority of the agency or the authority conferred by a provision of law;

In a review under RCW 34.05.570, the court may (a) affirm the agency action or (b) order an agency to take action required by law, order an agency to exercise discretion required by law, set aside agency action, enjoin or stay the agency action, remand the matter for further proceedings, or enter a declaratory judgment order. The court shall set out in its findings and conclusions, as appropriate, each violation or error by the agency under the standards for review set out in this chapter on which the court bases its decision and order. In reviewing matters within agency discretion, the court shall limit its function to assuring that the agency has exercised its discretion in accordance with law, and shall not itself undertake to exercise the discretion that the legislature has placed in the agency. The court shall remand to the agency for modification of agency action, unless remand is impracticable or would cause unnecessary delay.

2. The sole remedy available to a person who is wrongfully denied licensure based upon a failure to pass an examination administered by a state agency, or under its auspices, is the right to retake the examination free of the defect or defects the court may have found in the examination or the examination procedure.

3. The court may award damages, compensation, or ancillary relief only to the extent expressly authorized by another provision of law.

4. If the court sets aside or modifies agency action or remands the matter to the agency for further proceedings, the court may make any interlocutory order it finds necessary to preserve the interests of the parties and the public, pending further proceedings or agency action.

   b. If the agency has filed and is diligently prosecuting a petition for civil enforcement of the same order against the same person; or

   c. If a petition for review of the same order has been filed and a stay is in effect.

2. The petition shall name, as respondents, the agency whose order is sought to be enforced and each person against whom the petitioner seeks civil enforcement.

3. The agency whose order is sought to be enforced may move to dismiss the petition on the grounds that it fails to qualify under this section or that the enforcement would be contrary to the policy of the agency. The court shall grant the motion to dismiss the petition unless the petitioner demonstrates that (a) the petition qualifies under this section and (b) the agency's failure to enforce its order is based on an exercise of discretion that is arbitrary or capricious.

4. Except to the extent expressly authorized by law, a petition for civil enforcement may not request, and the court may not grant, any monetary payment apart from taxable costs.

\[ [1988 c 288 § 519](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20519); \]

   a. The agency action sought to be enforced is a rule and the respondent has not been a party in an adjudicative proceeding that provided an adequate opportunity to raise the issue; or

   b. The agency action sought to be enforced is an order and the respondent was not notified actually or constructively of the related adjudicative proceeding in substantial compliance with this chapter.

3. The court, to the extent necessary for the determination of the matter, may take new evidence.

\[ [1989 c 175 § 29](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c175.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20175%20§%2029); [1988 c 288 § 520](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c288.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20288%20§%20520); \]

A copy of the court's show cause order shall be served upon the person. If it appears to the court that the subpoena was properly issued, and that the particular questions the person refused to answer or the requests for production of documents were reasonable and relevant, the court shall enter an order that the person appear before the agency at the time and place fixed in the order and testify or produce the required documents, and on failing to obey this order the person shall be dealt with as for contempt of court.

2. Agencies with statutory authority to issue investigative subpoenas may petition for enforcement of such subpoenas in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. The agency may petition the superior court of any county where the subpoenaed person resides or is found, or where subpoenaed documents are located. If it appears to the court that the subpoena was properly issued, that the investigation is being conducted for a lawfully authorized purpose, and that the testimony or documents required to be produced are adequately specified and relevant to the investigation, the court shall enter an order that the person appear before the agency at the time and place fixed in the order and testify or produce the required documents, and failing to obey this order the person shall be dealt with as for contempt of court.
