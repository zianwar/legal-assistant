The schedule must be plainly printed in large type, and a copy of it shall be kept by every carrier readily accessible to inspection by the public in every station or office of the carrier where passengers or property are respectively received for transportation, when the station or office is in charge of any agent.

The form of each schedule must be prescribed by the commission.

In the case of a solid waste collection company, a change may not be made except after forty-five days' notice to the commission and to the public. The notice must be published as provided in RCW 81.28.040 and must plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the schedule then in force and the time when the changed rate, classification, fare, or charge will go into effect.
