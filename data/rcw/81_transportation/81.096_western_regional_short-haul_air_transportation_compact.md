## 81.96.020 - Terms and provisions.
The terms and provisions of the compact referred to in RCW 81.96.010 are as follows:

WESTERN REGIONAL SHORT-HAUL AIR

TRANSPORTATION COMPACT

Article I

PURPOSE

The party states recognize that short-haul air transportation is essential to a balanced and efficient transportation system in the West, meeting special needs created by particular geographic and population patterns in both rural and urban areas. They further recognize that it is not economically feasible for the commercial airlines to provide a full complement of short-haul air services or to explore fully the capabilities and limitations of the various types and locations of such services. They also recognize that careful planning, experimentation, and testing are needed before appropriate short-haul air transportation can be developed for all the situations in which it would be beneficial to the economy and general welfare of the western states. To meet this need, the party states agree that a regional compact should be established for the purpose of organizing and conducting a series of demonstration programs to test the feasibility of new short-haul air transportation concepts in the West.

Article II

REGIONAL COMMISSION

A. There is hereby established an agency of the party states to be known as the Western Regional Short-Haul Air Transportation Commission (hereinafter called the "Commission").

B. The Commission shall be composed of one member from each party state and one federal member, if authorized by federal law, who shall be the Secretary of Transportation or his designee. Each state member shall be appointed, suspended, or removed and shall serve subject to and in accordance with the laws of the state which he represents.

C. The state members shall each be entitled to one vote on the Commission. No action of the Commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all members representing the party states are present, and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the Commission are cast in favor thereof. The federal member shall not be entitled to a vote on the Commission unless authorized by a majority vote of the state members. The state members may provide that decisions of the Commission shall require the affirmative vote of the federal member and of a majority of the state members, if such provision is necessary in order to meet the requirements of federal law. In matters coming before the Commission, the state members shall, to the extent practicable, consult with representatives of appropriate local subdivisions within their respective states and the federal member, if any, shall consult with the federal departments and agencies having an interest in the subject matter.

D. The state members of the Commission shall elect annually, from among their number, a chairman and a vice chairman. The state members may provide that the chairman so elected shall be designated as the state cochairman and the federal member shall be designated as the federal cochairman, if such provision is necessary in order to meet the requirements of federal law.

E. Each state member shall have an alternate appointed in accordance with the laws of the state which he represents. The federal member, if any, shall have an alternate appointed in accordance with federal law. An alternate shall be entitled to vote in the event of the absence, death, disability, removal, or resignation of the state or federal member for whom he is an alternate.

Article III

FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION

A. It shall be the primary function of the Commission to authorize and effect a series of demonstration programs to test the feasibility of new short-haul air transportation concepts in the West. To carry out this function, the Commission shall have power to:

1. Establish basic regional demonstration policy and coordinate with federal policymakers where appropriate;

2. Create a management plan and implement programs through a suitable staff;

3. Designate demonstration arenas and facilities;

4. Select demonstration operators;
