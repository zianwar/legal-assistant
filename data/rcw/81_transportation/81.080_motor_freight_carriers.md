## 81.80.020 - Declaration of policy.
The business of operating as a motor carrier of freight for compensation along the highways of this state is declared to be a business affected with a public interest. The rapid increase of motor carrier freight traffic and the fact that under the existing law many motor trucks are not effectively regulated have increased the dangers and hazards on public highways and make it imperative that regulation to the fullest extent allowed under 49 U.S.C. Sec. 14501 should be employed to the end that the highways may be rendered safer for the use of the general public; that the wear of such highways may be reduced; that congestion on highways may be minimized; that the shippers of the state may be provided with a stabilized service and rate structure; that sound economic conditions in such transportation and among such carriers may be fostered in the public interest; that adequate, economical, and efficient service by motor carriers, and reasonable charges therefor, without unjust discrimination, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices may be promoted; that the common carriage of commodities by motor carrier may be preserved in the public interest; that the relations between, and transportation by and regulation of, motor carriers and other carriers may be improved and coordinated so that the highways of the state of Washington may be properly developed and preserved, and the public may be assured adequate, complete, dependable, and stable transportation service in all its phases.

Permits issued under this chapter are neither irrevocable nor subject to transfer or assignment except upon a proper showing that property rights might be affected thereby, and then in the discretion of the commission.

Any person, partnership, or corporation, singly or in combination with any other person, partnership, or corporation, whether a household goods carrier holding a permit or otherwise, or any combination of such, shall not acquire control or enter into any agreement or arrangement to acquire control of a household goods carrier holding a permit through ownership of its stock or through purchase, lease, or contract to manage the business, or otherwise, except after and with the approval and authorization of the commission. However, upon the dissolution of a partnership, which holds a permit, because of the death, bankruptcy, or withdrawal of a partner where the partner's interest is transferred to his or her spouse or to one or more remaining partners, or in the case of a corporation which holds a permit, in the case of the death of a shareholder where a shareholder's interest upon death is transferred to his or her spouse or to one or more of the remaining shareholders, the commission shall transfer the permit to the newly organized partnership that is substantially composed of the remaining partners, or continue the corporation's permit without hearing and protest. In all other cases, any transaction either directly or indirectly entered into without approval of the commission is void, and it is unlawful for any person seeking to acquire or divest control of the permit to be a party to the transaction without approval of the commission.

Every carrier who ceases operation and abandons his or her rights under the permits issued to him or her shall notify the commission within thirty days of the cessation or abandonment.

## 81.80.272 - Transfer of decedent's interest—Temporary continuance of operations.
Except as otherwise provided in RCW 81.80.270, any permit granted or issued to any household goods carrier under this chapter and held by a person alone or in conjunction with others other than as stockholders in a corporation at the time of his or her death is transferable as any other right or interest of the person's estate subject to the following:

1. Application for transfer must be made to the commission in a form and contain information prescribed by the commission. The transfer described in the application must be approved if it appears from the application or from any hearing held thereon or from any investigation thereof that the proposed transferee is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the services authorized by the permit to be transferred and to conform to the provisions of this chapter and the requirements, rules, and regulations of the commission, otherwise the application must be denied.

2. Temporary continuance of motor carrier operations without prior compliance with this section is recognized as justified by the public interest when the personal representatives, heirs, or surviving spouses of deceased persons desire to continue the operations of the carriers whom they succeed in interest subject to reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by the commission.

In case of temporary continuance under this section, the successor shall immediately procure insurance or deposit security as required by RCW 81.80.190.

The commission may enjoin any person from any violation of this chapter, or any order, rule, or regulation made by the commission pursuant to the terms hereof. If the suit is instituted by the commission, a bond is not required as a condition to the issuance of the injunction.

2. When the commission has canceled a household goods carrier permit, the carrier must, when directed by the commission, provide notice to every customer that its permit has been canceled, and provide proof of such notice to the commission.

For the purposes of this chapter, the terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband, wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family shall be interpreted as applying equally to state registered domestic partnerships or individuals in state registered domestic partnerships as well as to marital relationships and married persons, and references to dissolution of marriage shall apply equally to state registered domestic partnerships that have been terminated, dissolved, or invalidated, to the extent that such interpretation does not conflict with federal law. Where necessary to implement chapter 521, Laws of 2009, gender-specific terms such as husband and wife used in any statute, rule, or other law shall be construed to be gender neutral, and applicable to individuals in state registered domestic partnerships.
