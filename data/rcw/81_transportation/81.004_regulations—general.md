Complaint may be made by the commission of its own motion or by any person or corporation, chamber of commerce, board of trade, or any commercial, mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, or any body politic or municipal corporation, by petition or complaint in writing, setting forth any act or thing done or omitted to be done by any public service company or any person, persons, or entity acting as a public service company in violation, or claimed to be in violation, of any provision of law or of any order or rule of the commission.

When two or more public service companies or a person, persons, or entity acting as a public service company, (meaning to exclude municipal and other public corporations) are engaged in competition in any locality or localities in the state, either may make complaint against the other or others that the rates, charges, rules, regulations or practices of such other or others with or in respect to which the complainant is in competition, are unreasonable, unremunerative, discriminatory, illegal, unfair or intending or tending to oppress the complainant, to stifle competition, or to create or encourage the creation of monopoly, and upon such complaint or upon complaint of the commission upon its own motion, the commission shall have power, after notice and hearing as in other cases, to, by its order, subject to appeal as in other cases, correct the abuse complained of by establishing such uniform rates, charges, rules, regulations or practices in lieu of those complained of, to be observed by all of such competing public service companies in the locality or localities specified as shall be found reasonable, remunerative, nondiscriminatory, legal, and fair or tending to prevent oppression or monopoly or to encourage competition, and upon any such hearing it shall be proper for the commission to take into consideration the rates, charges, rules, regulations and practices of the public service company or companies complained of in any other locality or localities in the state.

All matters upon which complaint may be founded may be joined in one hearing, and no motion shall be entertained against a complaint for misjoinder of complaints or grievances or misjoinder of parties; and in any review of the courts of orders of the commission the same rule shall apply and pertain with regard to the joinder of complaints and parties as herein provided: PROVIDED, All grievances to be inquired into shall be plainly set forth in the complaint. No complaint shall be dismissed because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant.

Upon the filing of a complaint, the commission shall cause a copy thereof to be served upon the person or company complained of, which shall be accompanied by a notice fixing the time when and place where a hearing will be had upon such complaint. The time fixed for such hearing shall not be less than ten days after the date of the service of such notice and complaint, excepting as herein provided. Rules of practice and procedure not otherwise provided for in this title may be prescribed by the commission.

Whenever any public service company, subject to regulation by the commission as to rates and service, files with the commission any schedule, classification, rule, or regulation, the effect of which is to change any rate, fare, charge, rental, or toll previously charged, the commission may, either upon its own motion or upon complaint, upon notice, hold a hearing concerning the proposed change and the reasonableness and justness of it. Pending the hearing and the decision, the commission may suspend the operation of the rate, fare, charge, rental, or toll, if the change is proposed by a common carrier other than a solid waste collection company, for a period not exceeding seven months, and, if proposed by a solid waste collection company, for a period not exceeding ten months from the time the change would otherwise go into effect. After a full hearing the commission may make the order in reference to the change as would be provided in a hearing initiated after the change had become effective.

At any hearing involving any change in any schedule, classification, rule, or regulation the effect of which is to increase any rate, fare, charge, rental, or toll theretofore charged, the burden of proof to show that the increase is just and reasonable is upon the public service company. When any common carrier files any tariff, classification, rule, or regulation the effect of which is to decrease any rate, fare, or charge, the burden of proof to show that such decrease is just and reasonable is upon the common carrier.

Supp. 1943 § 10433-2; \]

## 81.04.250 - Determination of rates.
The commission may, upon complaint or upon its own motion, prescribe and authorize just and reasonable rates for the transportation of persons or property for any public service company subject to regulation by the commission as to rates and service, whenever and as often as it deems necessary or proper. The commission shall, before any hearing upon the complaint or motion, notify the complainants and the carrier concerned of the time and place of the hearing by giving at least ten days' written notice thereof, specifying that at the time and place designated a hearing will be held for the purpose of prescribing and authorizing the rates. The notice is sufficient to authorize the commission to inquire into and pass upon the matters designated in this section.

In exercising this power, the commission may use any standard, formula, method, or theory of valuation reasonably calculated to arrive at the objective of prescribing and authorizing just and reasonable rates.

In the exercise of this power, the commission may consider, in addition to other factors, the following:

1. The effect of the rates upon movement of traffic by the carriers;

2. The public need for adequate transportation facilities, equipment, and service at the lowest level of charges consistent with the provision, maintenance, and renewal of the facilities, equipment, and service; and

3. The carrier need for revenue of a level that under honest, efficient, and economical management is sufficient to cover the cost, including all operating expenses, depreciation accruals, rents, and taxes of every kind, of providing adequate transportation service, plus an amount equal to the percentage of that cost as is reasonably necessary for the provision, maintenance, and renewal of the transportation facilities or equipment and a reasonable profit to the carrier. The relation of carrier expenses to carrier revenues may be deemed the proper test of a reasonable profit.

The attorney general shall thereupon begin such action or proceeding by petition to such superior court, alleging the violation complained of, and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or injunction. It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify a time, not exceeding twenty days after the service of the copy of the petition, within which the public service company complained of must answer the petition. In case of default in answer or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances in such manner as the court shall direct, without other or formal pleadings, and without respect to any technical requirement. Such persons or corporations as the court may deem necessary or proper to be joined as parties, in order to make its judgment, order or writ effective, may be joined as parties. The final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that the writ of mandamus or injunction, or both, issue as prayed for in the petition, or in such other modified form as the court may determine will afford appropriate relief. Appellate review of the final judgment may be sought in the same manner and with the same effect as review of judgments of the superior court in actions to review orders of the commission. All provisions of this chapter relating to the time of review, the manner of perfecting the same, the filing of briefs, hearings and supersedeas, shall apply to appeals to the supreme court or the court of appeals under the provisions of this section.
