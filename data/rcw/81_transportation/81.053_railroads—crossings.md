In determining whether a separation of grades is practicable, the commission shall take into consideration the amount and character of travel on the railroad and on the highway; the grade and alignment of the railroad and the highway; the cost of separating grades; the topography of the country, and all other circumstances and conditions naturally involved in such an inquiry.

\[ [1961 c 14 § 81.53.020](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c14.pdf?cite=1961%20c%2014%20§%2081.53.020); [1913 c 30 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1913c30.pdf?cite=1913%20c%2030%20§%202); RRS § 10512; \]

## 81.53.030 - Petition for crossing—Hearing—Order.
Whenever a railroad company desires to cross a highway or railroad at grade, it shall file a written petition with the commission setting forth the reasons why the crossing cannot be made either above or below grade. Whenever the legislative authority of a county, or the municipal authorities of a city, or the state officers authorized to lay out and construct state roads, or the state parks and recreation commission, desire to extend a highway across a railroad at grade, they shall file a written petition with the commission, setting forth the reasons why the crossing cannot be made either above or below grade. Upon receiving the petition, the commission shall immediately investigate it, giving at least ten days' notice to the railroad company and the county or city affected thereby, of the time and place of the investigation, to the end that all parties interested may be present and heard. If the highway involved is a state road or parkway, the secretary of transportation or the state parks and recreation commission shall be notified of the time and place of hearing. The evidence introduced shall be reduced to writing and be filed by the commission. If it finds that it is not practicable to cross the railroad or highway either above or below grade, the commission shall enter a written order in the cause, either granting or denying the right to construct a grade crossing at the point in question. The commission may provide in the order authorizing a grade crossing, or at any subsequent time, that the railroad company shall install and maintain proper signals, warnings, flaggers, interlocking devices, or other devices or means to secure the safety of the public and its employees. In respect to existing railroad grade crossings over highways the construction of which grade crossings was accomplished other than under a commission order authorizing it, the commission may in any event require the railroad company to install and maintain, at or near each crossing, on both sides of it, a sign known as the sawbuck crossing sign with the lettering "Railroad Crossing" inscribed thereon with a suitable inscription indicating the number of tracks. The sign shall be of standard design conforming to specifications furnished by the Washington state department of transportation.

## 81.53.040 - Supplemental hearing—Change of route.
If the commission finds that it is impracticable to construct an over-crossing or under-crossing on the established or proposed highway, and shall find that by deflecting the established or proposed highway a practicable and feasible over-crossing or under-crossing or a safer grade crossing can be provided, it shall continue the hearing and hold a supplemental hearing thereon. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the supplemental hearing shall be given to all landowners that may be affected by the proposed change in location of the highways. At the supplemental hearing the commission shall inquire into the propriety and necessity of changing and deflecting the highway as proposed. If the proposed change in route of the highway involves the abandonment and vacation of a portion of an established highway, the owners of land contiguous to the portion of the highway to be vacated shall, in like manner, be notified of the time and place of the supplemental hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall enter its findings in writing, and shall determine the location of the crossing which may be constructed, and whether it shall be an under-crossing, over-crossing or grade crossing, and shall determine whether or not any proposed change in the route of an existing highway, or the abandonment of a portion thereof is advisable or necessary to secure an over-crossing, under-crossing, or safer grade crossing.

\[ [1961 c 14 § 81.53.040](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c14.pdf?cite=1961%20c%2014%20§%2081.53.040); [1955 c 310 § 4](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1955c310.pdf?cite=1955%20c%20310%20§%204); prior: 1937 c 22 § 1, part; 1913 c 30 § 3, part; RRS § 10513, part; \]

## 81.53.050 - Requirements of order on change of route.
If the commission finds and determines that a change in route of an existing highway, or vacation of a portion thereof, is necessary or advisable, it shall further find and determine what private property or property rights it is necessary to take, damage, or injuriously affect for the purpose of constructing the highway along a new route, and what private property or property rights, will be affected by the proposed vacation of a portion of an existing highway. The property and property rights found necessary to be taken, damaged, or affected shall be described in the findings with reasonable accuracy. In any action brought to acquire the right to take or damage any such property or property rights, the findings of the commission shall be conclusive as to the necessity therefor. A copy of the findings shall be served upon all parties to the cause.

## 81.53.060 - Petition for alteration of crossing—Closure of grade crossing without hearing.
The mayor and city council, or other governing body of any city or town, or the legislative authority of any county within which there exists any under-crossing, over-crossing, or grade crossing, or where any street or highway is proposed to be located or established across any railroad, or any railroad company whose road is crossed by any highway, may file with the commission their or its petition in writing, alleging that the public safety requires the establishment of an under-crossing or over-crossing, or an alteration in the method and manner of an existing crossing and its approaches, or in the style and nature of construction of an existing over-crossing, under-crossing, or grade crossing, or a change in the location of an existing highway or crossing, the closing or discontinuance of an existing highway crossing, and the diversion of travel thereon to another highway or crossing, or if not practicable, to change the crossing from grade or to close and discontinue the crossing, the opening of an additional crossing for the partial diversion of travel, and praying that this relief may be ordered. If the existing or proposed crossing is on a state road, highway, or parkway, the petition may be filed by the secretary of transportation or the state parks and recreation commission. If the existing crossing is adjacent to a project funded in part or in full by the state of Washington and managed by the department of transportation, and closure of the crossing is part of the project, the petition may be filed by the secretary of transportation or the secretary's designee, or if the petition is filed by another entity, the secretary of transportation or the secretary's designee shall intervene as a party in any hearing at which the closure of the crossing is contested. If the department of transportation is not a lead agency under chapter 43.21C RCW, a lead agency shall also intervene as a party in any hearing at which the closure of the crossing is contested. Upon the petition being filed, the commission shall fix a time and place for hearing the petition and shall give not less than twenty days' notice to the petitioner, the railroad company, and the municipality or county in which the crossing is situated. If the highway involved is a state highway or parkway, or if the crossing is adjacent to a project funded in part or in full by the state of Washington and managed by the department of transportation and closure of the crossing is part of the project, like notice shall be given to the secretary of transportation or the state parks and recreation commission. If the change petitioned for requires that private lands, property, or property rights be taken, damaged, or injuriously affected to open up a new route for the highway, or requires that any portion of any existing highway be vacated and abandoned, twenty days' notice of the hearing shall be given to the owner or owners of the private lands, property, and property rights which it is necessary to take, damage, or injuriously affect, and to the owner or owners of the private lands, property, or property rights that will be affected by the proposed vacation and abandonment of the existing highway. The commission shall also cause notice of the hearing to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community where the crossing is situated, which publication shall appear at least two days before the date of hearing. At the time and place fixed in the notice, all persons and parties interested are entitled to be heard and introduce evidence. In the case of a petition for closure of a grade crossing the commission may order the grade crossing closed without hearing where: (1) Notice of the filing of the petition is posted at, or as near as practical to, the crossing; (2) notice of the filing of the petition is published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community or area where the crossing is situated, which publication shall appear within the same week that the notice referred to in subsection (1) of this section is posted; and (3) no objections are received by the commission within twenty days from the date of the publication of the notice.

## 81.53.130 - Apportionment of cost.
In the construction of new railroads across existing highways, the railroads shall do or cause to be done all the work of constructing the crossings and road changes that may be required, and shall acquire and furnish whatever property or easements may be necessary, and shall pay, as provided in RCW 81.53.100 through 81.53.120, the entire expense of such work including all compensation or damages for property or property rights taken, damaged or injuriously affected. In all other cases the construction work may be apportioned by the commission between the parties who may be required to contribute to the cost thereof as the parties may agree, or as the commission may consider advisable. All work within the limits of railroad rights-of-way shall in every case be done by the railroad company owning or operating the same. The cost of acquiring additional lands, rights or easements to provide for the change of existing crossings shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, in the first instance be paid by the municipality or county within which the crossing is located; or in the case of a state road or parkway, shall be paid in the manner provided by law for paying the cost of acquiring lands, rights or easements for the construction of state roads or parkways. The expense accruing on account of property taken or damaged shall be divided and paid in the manner provided for dividing and paying other costs of construction. Upon the completion of the work and its approval by the commission, an accounting shall be had, and if it shall appear that any party has expended more than its proportion of the total cost, a settlement shall be forthwith made. If the parties shall be unable to agree upon a settlement, the commission shall arbitrate, adjust and settle the account after notice to the parties. In the event of failure and refusal of any party to pay its proportion of the expense, the sum with interest from the date of the settlement may be recovered in a civil action by the party entitled thereto. In cases where the commission has settled the account, the finding of the commission as to the amount due shall be conclusive in any civil action brought to recover the same if such finding has not been reviewed or appealed from as herein provided, and the time for review or appeal has expired. If any party shall seek review of any finding or order of the commission apportioning the cost between the parties liable therefor, the superior court, the court of appeals, or the supreme court, as the case may be, shall cause judgment to be entered in such review proceedings for such sum or sums as may be found lawfully or justly due by one party to another.

## 81.53.261 - Crossing signals, warning devices—Petition—Hearing—Order—Costs apportionment—Records not evidence for actions—Appeal.
Whenever the secretary of transportation or the governing body of any city, town, or county, or any railroad company whose road is crossed by any highway, shall deem that the public safety requires signals or other warning devices, other than sawbuck signs, at any crossing of a railroad at common grade by any state, city, town, or county highway, road, street, alley, avenue, boulevard, parkway, or other public place actually open and in use or to be opened and used for travel by the public, he or she or it shall file with the utilities and transportation commission a petition in writing, alleging that the public safety requires the installation of specified signals or other warning devices at such crossing or specified changes in the method and manner of existing crossing warning devices. Upon receiving such petition, the commission shall promptly set the matter for hearing, giving at least twenty days notice to the railroad company or companies and the county or municipality affected thereby, or the secretary of transportation in the case of a state highway, of the time and place of such hearing. At the time and place fixed in the notice, all persons and parties interested shall be entitled to be heard and introduce evidence, which shall be reduced to writing and filed by the commission. If the commission shall determine from the evidence that public safety does not require the installation of the signal, other warning device or change in the existing warning device specified in the petition, it shall make determinations to that effect and enter an order denying said petition in toto. If the commission shall determine from the evidence that public safety requires the installation of such signals or other warning devices at such crossing or such change in the existing warning devices at said crossing, it shall make determinations to that effect and enter an order directing the installation of such signals or other warning devices or directing that such changes shall be made in existing warning devices. The commission shall also at said hearing apportion the entire cost of installation and maintenance of such signals or other warning devices, other than sawbuck signs, as provided in RCW 81.53.271: PROVIDED, That upon agreement by all parties to waive hearing, the commission shall forthwith enter its order.

No railroad shall be required to install any such signal or other warning device until the public body involved has either paid or executed its promise to pay to the railroad its portion of the estimated cost thereof.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to foreclose the right of the interested parties to enter into an agreement, franchise, or permit arrangement providing for the installation of signals or other warning devices at any such crossing or for the apportionment of the cost of installation and maintenance thereof, or compliance with an existing agreement, franchise, or permit arrangement providing for the same.

The hearing and determinations authorized by this section may be instituted by the commission on its own motion, and the proceedings, hearing, and consequences thereof shall be the same as for the hearing and determination of any petition authorized by this section.

No part of the record, or a copy thereof, of the hearing and determination provided for in this section and no finding, conclusion, or order made pursuant thereto shall be used as evidence in any trial, civil or criminal, arising out of an accident at or in the vicinity of any crossing prior to installation of signals or other warning devices pursuant to an order of the commission as a result of any such investigation.

## 81.53.271 - Crossing signals, warning devices—Petition contents—Apportionment of installation and maintenance costs.
The petition shall set forth by description the location of the crossing or crossings, the type of signal or other warning device to be installed, the necessity from the standpoint of public safety for such installation, the approximate cost of installation and related work, and the approximate annual cost of maintenance. If the commission directs the installation of a grade crossing protective device, and a federal-aid funding program is available to participate in the costs of such installation, installation and maintenance costs of the device shall be apportioned in accordance with the provisions of RCW 81.53.295. Otherwise if installation is directed by the commission, it shall apportion the cost of installation and maintenance as provided in this section:

1. Installation: (a) The first twenty thousand dollars shall be apportioned to the grade crossing protective fund created by RCW 81.53.281; and

   b. The remainder of the cost shall be apportioned as follows:

      i. Sixty percent to the grade crossing protective fund, created by RCW 81.53.281;

      ii. Thirty percent to the city, town, county, or state; and

      iii. Ten percent to the railroad:

PROVIDED, That, if the proposed installation is located at a new crossing requested by a city, town, county, or state, forty percent of the cost shall be apportioned to the city, town, county, or state, and none to the railroad. If the proposed installation is located at a new crossing requested by a railroad, then the entire cost shall be apportioned to the railroad. In the event the city, town, county, or state should concurrently petition the commission and secure an order authorizing the closure of an existing crossing or crossings in proximity to the crossing for which installation of signals or other warning devices shall have been directed, the apportionment to the petitioning city, town, county, or state shall be reduced by ten percent of the total cost for each crossing ordered closed and the apportionment from the grade crossing protective fund increased accordingly. This exception shall not be construed to permit a charge to the grade crossing protective fund in an amount greater than the total cost otherwise apportionable to the city, town, county, or state. No reduction shall be applied where one crossing is closed and another opened in lieu thereof, nor to crossings of a private nature.

2. Maintenance: (a) Twenty-five percent to the grade crossing protective fund, created by RCW 81.53.281; and

   b. Seventy-five percent to the railroad:

PROVIDED, That if the proposed installation is located at a new crossing requested by a railroad, then the entire cost shall be apportioned to the railroad.

## 81.53.281 - Crossing signals, warning devices—Grade crossing protective fund—Use and transfer of funds—Allocation of costs—Procedure—Federal funding.
There is hereby created in the state treasury a "grade crossing protective fund" to carry out the provisions of RCW 81.53.261, 81.53.271, 81.53.281, 81.53.291, and 81.53.295; for grants and/or subsidies to public, private, and nonprofit entities for rail safety projects authorized or ordered by the commission; and for personnel and associated costs related to supervising and administering rail safety grants and/or subsidies. During the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium, funds in this account may also be used to conduct the study required under section 102, chapter 222, Laws of 2014. The commission shall transfer from the public service revolving fund's miscellaneous fees and penalties accounts moneys appropriated for these purposes as needed. At the time the commission makes each allocation of cost to said grade crossing protective fund, it shall certify that such cost shall be payable out of said fund. When federal-aid highway funds are involved, the department of transportation shall, upon entry of an order by the commission requiring the installation or upgrading of a grade crossing protective device, submit to the commission an estimate for the cost of the proposed installation and related work. Upon receipt of the estimate the commission shall pay to the department of transportation the percentage of the estimate specified in RCW 81.53.295, as now or hereafter amended, to be used as the grade crossing protective fund portion of the cost of the installation and related work.

The commission may adopt rules for the allocation of money from the grade crossing protective fund. During the 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 fiscal biennia, the commission may waive rules regarding local matching fund requirements, maximum awards for individual projects, and other application requirements as necessary to expedite the allocation of money from the grade crossing protective fund to address underprotected grade crossings as identified by the commission.
