## 28C.04.400 - Job skills program—Legislative declaration and policy.
The legislature declares that it is an important function of government to increase opportunities for gainful employment, to assist in promoting a productive and expanding economy, and to encourage the flow of business and industry support to educational institutions.

It is the policy of the state of Washington to ensure that programs of skill training are available on a regional basis and are utilized by a variety of businesses and industries.
