## 7.60.015 - Types of receivers.
A receiver must be either a general receiver or a custodial receiver. A receiver must be a general receiver if the receiver is appointed to take possession and control of all or substantially all of a person's property with authority to liquidate that property and, in the case of a business over which the receiver is appointed, wind up affairs. A receiver must be a custodial receiver if the receiver is appointed to take charge of limited or specific property of a person or is not given authority to liquidate property. The court shall specify in the order appointing a receiver whether the receiver is appointed as a general receiver or as a custodial receiver. When the sole basis for the appointment is the pendency of an action to foreclose upon a lien against real property, or the giving of a notice of a trustee's sale under RCW 61.24.040 or a notice of forfeiture under RCW 61.30.040, the court shall appoint the receiver as a custodial receiver. The court by order may convert either a general receivership or a custodial receivership into the other.

   b. Provisionally, after commencement of any judicial action or nonjudicial proceeding to foreclose upon any lien against or for forfeiture of any interest in real or personal property, on application of any person, when the interest in the property that is the subject of such an action or proceeding of the person seeking the receiver's appointment is determined to be probable and either:

   g. Upon an attachment of real or personal property when the property attached is of a perishable nature or is otherwise in danger of waste, impairment, or destruction, or where the abandoned property's owner has absconded with, secreted, or abandoned the property, and it is necessary to collect, conserve, manage, control, or protect it, or to dispose of it promptly, or when the court determines that the nature of the property or the exigency of the case otherwise provides cause for the appointment of a receiver;

   h. In an action by a transferor of real or personal property to avoid or rescind the transfer on the basis of fraud, or in an action to subject property or a fund to the payment of a debt;

   i. In an action against any person who is not an individual if the object of the action is the dissolution of that person, or if that person has been dissolved, or if that person is insolvent or is not generally paying the person's debts as those debts become due unless they are the subject of bona fide dispute, or if that person is in imminent danger of insolvency;

2. The superior courts of this state shall appoint as receiver of property located in this state a person who has been appointed by a federal or state court located elsewhere as receiver with respect to the property specifically or with respect to the owner's property generally, upon the application of the person or of any party to that foreign proceeding, and following the appointment shall give effect to orders, judgments, and decrees of the foreign court affecting the property in this state held by the receiver, unless the court determines that to do so would be manifestly unjust or inequitable.

3. At least seven days' notice of any application for the appointment of a receiver must be given to the owner of property to be subject thereto and to all other parties in the action, and to other parties in interest as the court may require. If any execution by a judgment creditor under Title 6 RCW or any application by a judgment creditor for the appointment of a receiver, with respect to property over which the receiver's appointment is sought, is pending in any other action at the time the application is made, then notice of the application for the receiver's appointment also must be given to the judgment creditor in the other action. The court may shorten or expand the period for notice of an application for the appointment of a receiver upon good cause shown.

4. The order appointing a receiver in all cases must reasonably describe the property over which the receiver is to take charge, by category, individual items, or both if the receiver is to take charge of less than all of the owner's property. If the order appointing a receiver does not expressly limit the receiver's authority to designated property or categories of property of the owner, the receiver is a general receiver with the authority to take charge over all of the owner's property, wherever located.

5. The court may condition the appointment of a receiver upon the giving of security by the person seeking the receiver's appointment, in such amount as the court may specify, for the payment of costs and damages incurred or suffered by any person should it later be determined that the appointment of the receiver was wrongfully obtained.

The power to incur or pay expenses incidental to the receiver's preservation and use of the property with respect to which the appointment applies, and otherwise in the performance of the receiver's duties, including the power to pay obligations incurred prior to the receiver's appointment if and to the extent that payment is determined by the receiver to be prudent in order to preserve the value of property in the receiver's possession and the funds used for this purpose are not subject to any lien or right of setoff in favor of a creditor who has not consented to the payment and whose interest is not otherwise adequately protected;

   b. If the appointment applies to all or substantially all of the property of an operating business or any revenue-producing property of any person, to do all things which the owner of the business or property might do in the ordinary course of the operation of the business as a going concern or use of the property including, but not limited to, the purchase and sale of goods or services in the ordinary course of such business, and the incurring and payment of expenses of the business or property in the ordinary course;

   c. The power to assert any rights, claims, or choses in action of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed relating thereto, if and to the extent that the claims are themselves property within the scope of the appointment or relate to any property, to maintain in the receiver's name or in the name of such a person any action to enforce any right, claim, or chose in action, and to intervene in actions in which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is a party for the purpose of exercising the powers under this subsection (1)(c);

   d. The power to intervene in any action in which a claim is asserted against the person over whose property the receiver is appointed relating thereto, for the purpose of prosecuting or defending the claim and requesting the transfer of venue of the action to the court. However, the court shall not transfer actions in which both a state agency is a party and as to which a statute expressly vests jurisdiction or venue elsewhere. This power is exercisable with court approval in the case of a liquidating receiver, and with or without court approval in the case of a general receiver;

   e. The power to assert rights, claims, or choses in action of the receiver arising out of transactions in which the receiver is a participant;

   f. The power to pursue in the name of the receiver any claim under chapter 19.40 RCW assertable by any creditor of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, if pursuit of the claim is determined by the receiver to be appropriate;

   g. The power to seek and obtain advice or instruction from the court with respect to any course of action with respect to which the receiver is uncertain in the exercise of the receiver's powers or the discharge of the receiver's duties;

   h. The power to obtain appraisals with respect to property in the hands of the receiver;

   i. The power by subpoena to compel any person to submit to an examination under oath, in the manner of a deposition in a civil case, with respect to estate property or any other matter that may affect the administration of the receivership; and

   j. Other powers as may be conferred upon the receiver by the court or otherwise by statute or rule.

2. A receiver has the following duties in addition to those specifically conferred by this chapter or otherwise by statute or court rule:

   a. The duty to notify all federal and state taxing and applicable regulatory agencies of the receiver's appointment in accordance with any applicable laws imposing this duty, including but not limited to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6036 and RCW 51.14.073, 51.16.160, and 82.32.240, or any successor statutes;

   b. The duty to comply with state law;

   c. If the receiver is appointed with respect to any real property, the duty to file with the auditor of the county in which the real property is located, or the registrar of lands in accordance with *RCW 65.12.600 in the case of registered lands, a certified copy of the order of appointment, together with a legal description of the real property if one is not included in that order; and

   d. Other duties as the receiver may be directed to perform by the court or as may be provided for by statute or rule.

3. The various powers and duties of a receiver provided for by this chapter may be expanded, modified, or limited by order of the court for good cause shown.

## 7.60.070 - Turnover of property.
Upon demand by a receiver appointed under this chapter, any person shall turn over any property over which the receiver has been appointed that is within the possession or control of that person unless otherwise ordered by the court for good cause shown. A receiver by motion may seek to compel turnover of estate property unless there exists a bona fide dispute with respect to the existence or nature of the receiver's interest in the property, in which case turnover shall be sought by means of an action under RCW 7.60.160. In the absence of a bona fide dispute with respect to the receiver's right to possession of estate property, the failure to relinquish possession and control to the receiver shall be punishable as a contempt of the court.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%209); \]

## 7.60.080 - Duties of person over whose property the receiver is appointed.

4. Following the receiver's appointment, submit to examination by the receiver, or by any other person upon order of the court, under oath, concerning the acts, conduct, property, liabilities, and financial condition of that person or any matter relating to the receiver's administration of the estate.

When the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is an entity, each of the officers, directors, managers, members, partners, or other individuals exercising or having the power to exercise control over the affairs of the entity are subject to the requirements of this section.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2010); \]

2. In all other cases, within thirty-five days after the date of appointment of a general receiver, the receiver shall file as schedule A a true list of all of the known creditors and applicable regulatory and taxing agencies of the person over whose assets the receiver is appointed, their mailing addresses, the amount and nature of their claims, and whether their claims are disputed; and as schedule B a true list of all property of the estate identifiable by the receiver, including the estimated liquidation value and location of the property and, if real property, a legal description thereof, as of the date of appointment of the receiver.

## 7.60.100 - Receiver's reports.
A general receiver shall file with the court a monthly report of the receiver's operations and financial affairs unless otherwise ordered by the court. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, each report of a general receiver shall be due by the last day of the subsequent month and shall include the following:

1. A balance sheet;

2. A statement of income and expenses;

3. A statement of cash receipts and disbursements;

4. A statement of accrued accounts receivable of the receiver. The statement shall disclose amounts considered to be uncollectable;

5. A statement of accounts payable of the receiver, including professional fees. The statement shall list the name of each creditor and the amounts owing and remaining unpaid over thirty days; and

6. A tax disclosure statement, which shall list postfiling taxes due or tax deposits required, the name of the taxing agency, the amount due, the date due, and an explanation for any failure to make payments or deposits.

A custodial receiver shall file with the court all such reports the court may require.

## 7.60.110 - Automatic stay of certain proceedings.
1. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the entry of an order appointing a general receiver or a custodial receiver with respect to all of a person's property shall operate as a stay, applicable to all persons, of:

   a. The commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the person over whose property the receiver is appointed that was or could have been commenced before the entry of the order of appointment, or to recover a claim against the person that arose before the entry of the order of appointment;

   b. The enforcement, against the person over whose property the receiver is appointed or any estate property, of a judgment obtained before the order of appointment;

   c. Any act to obtain possession of estate property from the receiver, or to interfere with, or exercise control over, estate property;

   d. Any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien or claim against estate property except by exercise of a right of setoff, to the extent that the lien secures a claim against the person that arose before the entry of the order of appointment; or

   e. Any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the person that arose before the entry of the order of appointment.

2. The stay shall automatically expire as to the acts specified in subsection (1)(a), (b), and (e) of this section sixty days after the entry of the order of appointment unless before the expiration of the sixty-day period the receiver, for good cause shown, obtains an order of the court extending the stay, after notice and a hearing. A person whose action or proceeding is stayed by motion to the court may seek relief from the stay for good cause shown. Any judgment obtained against the person over whose property the receiver is appointed or estate property following the entry of the order of appointment is not a lien against estate property unless the receivership is terminated prior to a conveyance of the property against which the judgment would otherwise constitute a lien.

3. The entry of an order appointing a receiver does not operate as a stay of:

   a. The continuation of a judicial action or nonjudicial proceeding of the type described in RCW 7.60.025(1) (b), (ee), or (ff), if the action or proceeding was initiated by the party seeking the receiver's appointment;

   b. The commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding against the person over whose property the receiver is appointed;

   c. The commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding to establish paternity, or to establish or modify an order for alimony, maintenance, or support, or to collect alimony, maintenance, or support under any order of a court;

   d. Any act to perfect, or to maintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in estate property if the interest perfected would be effective against a creditor of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed holding at the time of the entry of the order of appointment either a perfected nonpurchase money security interest under chapter 62A.9A RCW against the property involved, or a lien by attachment, levy, or the like, whether or not such a creditor exists. If perfection of an interest would require seizure of the property involved or the commencement of an action, the perfection shall instead be accomplished by filing, and by serving upon the receiver, or receiver's counsel, if any, notice of the interest within the time fixed by law for seizure or commencement;

   e. The commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce its police or regulatory power;

   f. The enforcement of a judgment, other than a money judgment, obtained in an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce its police or regulatory power, or with respect to any licensure of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed;

   g. The exercise of a right of setoff, including but not limited to (i) any right of a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, or securities clearing agency to set off a claim for a margin payment or settlement payment arising out of a commodity contract, forward contract, or securities contract against cash, securities, or other property held or due from the commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, or securities clearing agency to margin, guarantee, secure, or settle the commodity contract, forward contract, or securities contract, and (ii) any right of a swap participant to set off a claim for a payment due to the swap participant under or in connection with a swap agreement against any payment due from the swap participant under or in connection with the swap agreement or against cash, securities, or other property of the debtor held by or due from the swap participant to guarantee, secure, or settle the swap agreement; or

   h. The establishment by a governmental unit of any tax liability and any appeal thereof.

## 7.60.120 - Utility service.
A utility providing service to estate property may not alter, refuse, or discontinue service to the property without first giving the receiver fifteen days' notice of any default or intention to alter, refuse, or discontinue service to estate property. This section does not prohibit the court, upon motion by the receiver, to prohibit the alteration or cessation of utility service if the receiver can furnish adequate assurance of payment, in the form of deposit or other security, for service to be provided after entry of the order appointing the receiver.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 14](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2014); \]

## 7.60.130 - Executory contracts and unexpired leases.
1. A general receiver may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed upon order of the court following notice to the other party to the contract or lease upon notice and a hearing. The court may condition assumption or rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease on the terms and conditions the court believes are just and proper under the particular circumstances of the case. A general receiver's performance of an executory contract or unexpired lease prior to the court's authorization of its assumption or rejection shall not constitute an assumption of the contract or lease, or an agreement by the receiver to assume it, nor otherwise preclude the receiver thereafter from seeking the court's authority to reject it.

2. Any obligation or liability incurred by a general receiver on account of the receiver's assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease shall be treated as an expense of the receivership. A general receiver's rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease shall be treated as a breach of the contract or lease occurring immediately prior to the receiver's appointment; and the receiver's right to possess or use property pursuant to any executory contract or lease shall terminate upon rejection of the contract or lease. The other party to an executory contract or unexpired lease that is rejected by a general receiver may take such steps as may be necessary under applicable law to terminate or cancel the contract or lease. The claim of a party to an executory contract or unexpired lease resulting from a general receiver's rejection of it shall be served upon the receiver in the manner provided for by RCW 7.60.210 within thirty days following the rejection.

3. A general receiver's power under this section to assume an executory contract or unexpired lease shall not be affected by any provision in the contract or lease that would effect or permit a forfeiture, modification, or termination of it on account of either the receiver's appointment, the financial condition of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors by that person.

4. A general receiver may not assume an executory contract or unexpired lease of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed without the consent of the other party to the contract or lease if:

   a. Applicable law would excuse a party, other than the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, from accepting performance from or rendering performance to anyone other than the person even in the absence of any provisions in the contract or lease expressly restricting or prohibiting an assignment of the person's rights or the performance of the person's duties;

   b. The contract or lease is a contract to make a loan or extend credit or financial accommodations to or for the benefit of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, or to issue a security of the person; or

   c. The executory contract or lease expires by its own terms, or under applicable law prior to the receiver's assumption thereof.

5. A receiver may not assign an executory contract or unexpired lease without assuming it, absent the consent of the other parties to the contract or lease.

6. If the receiver rejects an executory contract or unexpired lease for:

   a. The sale of real property under which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the seller and the purchaser is in possession of the real property;

   b. The sale of a real property timeshare interest under which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the seller;

   c. The license of intellectual property rights under which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the licensor; or

   d. The lease of real property in which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the lessor;

then the purchaser, licensee, or lessee may treat the rejection as a termination of the contract, license agreement, or lease, or alternatively, the purchaser, licensee, or lessee may remain in possession in which case the purchaser, licensee, or lessee shall continue to perform all obligations arising thereunder as and when they may fall due, but may offset against any payments any damages occurring on account of the rejection after it occurs. The purchaser of real property in such a case is entitled to receive from the receiver any deed or any other instrument of conveyance which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is obligated to deliver under the executory contract when the purchaser becomes entitled to receive it, and the deed or instrument has the same force and effect as if given by the person. A purchaser, licensee, or lessee who elects to remain in possession under the terms of this subsection has no rights against the receiver on account of any damages arising from the receiver's rejection except as expressly provided for by this subsection. A purchaser of real property who elects to treat rejection of an executory contract as a termination has a lien against the interest in that real property of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed for the recovery of any portion of the purchase price that the purchaser has paid.

7. Any contract with the state shall be deemed rejected if not assumed within sixty days of appointment of a general receiver unless the receiver and state agency agree to its assumption or as otherwise ordered by the court for good cause shown.

8. Nothing in this chapter affects the enforceability of antiassignment prohibitions provided under contract or applicable law.

\[ [2011 c 34 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5058.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2034%20§%205); [2004 c 165 § 15](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2015); \]

## 7.60.140 - Receivership financing.
1. If a receiver is authorized to operate the business of a person or manage a person's property, the receiver may obtain unsecured credit and incur unsecured debt in the ordinary course of business allowable under RCW 7.60.230(1)(a) as an administrative expense of the receiver without order of the court.

2. The court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize a receiver to obtain credit or incur indebtedness other than in the ordinary course of business. The court may allow the receiver to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber estate property as security for repayment of any indebtedness that the receiver may incur.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2016); \]

## 7.60.150 - Abandonment of property.
The receiver, or any party in interest, upon order of the court following notice and a hearing, and upon the conditions or terms the court considers just and proper, may abandon any estate property that is burdensome to the receiver or is of inconsequential value or benefit. However, a receiver may not abandon property that is a hazard or potential hazard to the public in contravention of a state statute or rule that is reasonably designed to protect the public health or safety from identified hazards, including but not limited to chapters 70A.300 and 70A.305 RCW. Property that is abandoned no longer constitutes estate property.

\[ [2021 c 65 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1192.SL.pdf?cite=2021%20c%2065%20§%207); [2004 c 165 § 17](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2017); \]

## 7.60.160 - Actions by and against the receiver or affecting property held by receiver.
1. The receiver has the right to sue and be sued in the receiver's capacity as such, without leave of court, in all cases necessary or proper for the conduct of the receivership. However, action seeking to dispossess the receiver of any estate property or otherwise to interfere with the receiver's management or control of any estate property may not be maintained or continued unless permitted by order of the court obtained upon notice and a hearing.

2. Litigation by or against a receiver is adjunct to the receivership case. The clerk of the court shall assign a cause number that reflects the relationship of any litigation to the receivership case. All pleadings in adjunct litigation shall include the cause number of the receivership case as well as the adjunct litigation number assigned by the clerk of the court. All adjunct litigation shall be referred to the judge, if any, assigned to the receivership case.

3. The receiver may be joined or substituted as a party in any suit or proceeding that was pending at the time of the receiver's appointment and in which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is a party, upon application by the receiver to the court or agency before which the action is pending.

4. Venue for adjunct litigation by or against the receiver shall lie in the court in which the receivership is pending, if the courts of this state have jurisdiction over the cause. Actions in other courts in this state shall be transferred to the court upon the receiver's filing of a motion for change of venue, provided that the receiver files the motion within thirty days following service of original process upon the receiver. However, actions in other courts or forums in which a state agency is a party shall not be transferred on request of the receiver absent consent of the affected state agency or grounds provided under other applicable law.

5. Action by or against a receiver does not abate by reason of death or resignation of the receiver, but continues against the successor receiver or against the entity in receivership, if a successor receiver is not appointed.

6. Whenever the assets of any domestic or foreign corporation, that has been doing business in this state, has been placed in the hands of any general receiver and the receiver is in possession of its assets, service of all process upon the corporation may be made upon the receiver.

7. A judgment against a general receiver is not a lien on the property or funds of the receivership, nor shall any execution issue thereon, but upon entry of the judgment in the court in which a general receivership is pending, or upon filing in a general receivership of a certified copy of the judgment from another jurisdiction, the judgment shall be treated as an allowed claim in the receivership. A judgment against a custodial receiver shall be treated and has the same effect as a judgment against the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, except that the judgment is not enforceable against estate property unless otherwise ordered by the court upon notice and a hearing.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 18](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2018); \]

## 7.60.170 - Personal liability of receiver.
1. [Empty]

   a. The receiver is personally liable to the person over whose property the receiver is appointed or its record or beneficial owners, or to the estate, for loss or diminution in value of or damage to estate property, only if (i) the loss or damage is caused by a failure on the part of the receiver to comply with an order of the court, or (ii) the loss or damage is caused by an act or omission for which members of a board of directors of a business corporation organized and existing under the laws of this state who vote to approve the act or omission are liable to the corporation in cases in which the liability of directors is limited to the maximum extent permitted by RCW 23B.08.320.

2. Claims must be served by delivering the claim to the general receiver within thirty days from the date notice is given by mail under this section, unless the court reduces or extends the period for cause shown, except that a claim arising from the rejection of an executory contract or an unexpired lease of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed may be filed within thirty days after the rejection. Claims need not be filed. Claims must be served by state agencies on the general receiver within one hundred eighty days from the date notice is given by mail under this section.

4. A claim, executed and served in accordance with this section, constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 23](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2023); \]

## 7.60.220 - Objection to and allowance of claims.
1. At any time prior to the entry of an order approving the general receiver's final report, the general receiver or any party in interest may file with the court an objection to a claim, which objection must be in writing and must set forth the grounds for the objection. A copy of the objection, together with notice of hearing, must be mailed to the creditor at least thirty days prior to the hearing. Claims properly served upon the general receiver and not disallowed by the court are entitled to share in distributions from the estate in accordance with the priorities provided for by this chapter or otherwise by law.

3. Upon motion of the general receiver or other party in interest, the following claims may be estimated for purpose of allowance under this section under the rules or orders applicable to the estimation of claims under this subsection:

Claims subject to this subsection shall be allowed in the estimated amount thereof.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 24](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2024); \]

## 7.60.230 - Priorities.
1. Allowed claims in a general receivership shall receive distribution under this chapter in the order of priority under (a) through (h) of this subsection and, with the exception of (a) and (c) of this subsection, on a pro rata basis.

   a. Creditors with liens on property of the estate, which liens are duly perfected under applicable law, shall receive the proceeds from the disposition of their collateral. However, the receiver may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable, necessary expenses of preserving, protecting, or disposing of the property to the extent of any benefit to the creditors. If and to the extent that the proceeds are less than the amount of a creditor's allowed claim or a creditor's lien is avoided on any basis, the creditor is an unsecured claim under (h) of this subsection. Secured claims shall be paid from the proceeds in accordance with their respective priorities under otherwise applicable law.

   b. Actual, necessary costs and expenses incurred during the administration of the estate, other than those expenses allowable under (a) of this subsection, including allowed fees and reimbursement of reasonable charges and expenses of the receiver and professional persons employed by the receiver under RCW 7.60.180. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, expenses incurred during the administration of the estate have priority over the secured claim of any creditor obtaining or consenting to the appointment of the receiver.

   c. Creditors with liens on property of the estate, which liens have not been duly perfected under applicable law, shall receive the proceeds from the disposition of their collateral if and to the extent that unsecured claims are made subject to those liens under applicable law.

   d. Claims for wages, salaries, or commissions, including vacation, severance, and sick leave pay, or contributions to an employee benefit plan, earned by the claimant within one hundred eighty days of the date of appointment of the receiver or the cessation of the estate's business, whichever occurs first, but only to the extent of ten thousand nine hundred fifty dollars.

   e. Allowed unsecured claims, to the extent of two thousand four hundred twenty-five dollars for each individual, arising from the deposit with the person over whose property the receiver is appointed before the date of appointment of the receiver of money in connection with the purchase, lease, or rental of property or the purchase of services for personal, family, or household use by individuals that were not delivered or provided.

   f. Claims for a support debt as defined in RCW 74.20A.020(10), but not to the extent that the debt (i) is assigned to another entity, voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise; or (ii) includes a liability designated as a support obligation unless that liability is actually in the nature of a support obligation.

   g. Unsecured claims of governmental units for taxes which accrued prior to the date of appointment of the receiver.

   h. Other unsecured claims.

2. If all of the classes under subsection (1) of this section have been paid in full, any residue shall be paid to the person over whose property the receiver is appointed.

\[ [2011 c 34 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5058.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2034%20§%208); [2004 c 165 § 25](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2025); \]

## 7.60.240 - Secured claims against after-acquired property.
Except as otherwise provided for by statute, property acquired by the estate or by the person over whose property the receiver is appointed after the date of appointment of the receiver is subject to an allowed secured claim to the same extent as would be the case in the absence of a receivership.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 26](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2026); \]

## 7.60.250 - Interest on claims.
To the extent that funds are available in the estate for distribution to creditors in a general receivership, the holder of an allowed noncontingent, liquidated claim is entitled to receive interest at the legal rate or other applicable rate from the date of appointment of the receiver or the date on which the claim became a noncontingent, liquidated claim. If there are sufficient funds in the estate to fully pay all interest owing to all members of the class, then interest shall be paid proportionately to each member of the class.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 27](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2027); \]

## 7.60.260 - Receiver's disposition of property—Sales free and clear.
1. The receiver, with the court's approval after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease estate property other than in the ordinary course of business. Except in the case of a leasehold estate with a remaining term of less than two years or a vendor's interest in a real estate contract, estate property consisting of real property may not be sold by a custodial receiver other than in the ordinary course of business.

2. The court may order that a general receiver's sale of estate property either (a) under subsection (1) of this section, or (b) consisting of real property which the debtor intended to sell in its ordinary course of business be effected free and clear of liens and of all rights of redemption, whether or not the sale will generate proceeds sufficient to fully satisfy all claims secured by the property, unless either:

   i. The property is real property used principally in the production of crops, livestock, or aquaculture, or the property is a homestead under RCW 6.13.010(1), and the owner of the property has not consented to the sale following the appointment of the receiver; or

      ii. The owner of the property or a creditor with an interest in the property serves and files a timely opposition to the receiver's sale, and the court determines that the amount likely to be realized by the objecting person from the receiver's sale is less than the person would realize within a reasonable time in the absence of the receiver's sale.

Upon any sale free and clear of liens authorized by this section, all security interests and other liens encumbering the property conveyed transfer and attach to the proceeds of the sale, net of reasonable expenses incurred in the disposition of the property, in the same order, priority, and validity as the liens had with respect to the property immediately before the conveyance. The court may authorize the receiver at the time of sale to satisfy, in whole or in part, any allowed claim secured by the property out of the proceeds of its sale if the interest of any other creditor having a lien against the proceeds of the sale would not thereby be impaired.

3. At a public sale of property under subsection (1) of this section, a creditor with an allowed claim secured by a lien against the property to be sold may bid at the sale of the property. A secured creditor who purchases the property from a receiver may offset against the purchase price its allowed secured claim against the property, provided that the secured creditor tenders cash sufficient to satisfy in full all secured claims payable out of the proceeds of sale having priority over the secured creditor's secured claim. If the lien or the claim it secures is the subject of a bona fide dispute, the court may order the holder of the claim to provide the receiver with adequate security to assure full payment of the purchase price in the event the lien, the claim, or any part thereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable.

4. If estate property includes an interest as a co-owner of property, the receiver shall have the rights and powers of a co-owner afforded by applicable state or federal law, including but not limited to any rights of partition.

5. The reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization to sell or lease estate property under this section does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under that authorization to an entity that purchased or leased the property in good faith, whether or not the entity knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless the authorization and sale or lease were stayed pending the appeal.

\[ [2011 c 34 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5058.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2034%20§%209); [2004 c 165 § 28](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2028); \]

## 7.60.270 - Ancillary receiverships.
1. A receiver appointed in any action pending in the courts of this state, without first seeking approval of the court, may apply to any court outside of this state for appointment as receiver with respect to any property or business of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed constituting estate property which is located in any other jurisdiction, if the appointment is necessary to the receiver's possession, control, management, or disposition of property in accordance with orders of the court.

2. A receiver appointed by a court of another state, or by a federal court in any district outside of this state, or any other person having an interest in that proceeding, may obtain appointment by a superior court of this state of that same receiver with respect to any property or business of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed constituting property of the foreign receivership that is located in this jurisdiction, if the person is eligible under RCW 7.60.035 to serve as receiver, and if the appointment is necessary to the receiver's possession, control, or disposition of the property in accordance with orders of the court in the foreign proceeding. The superior court upon the receiver's request shall enter the orders, not offensive to the laws and public policy of this state, necessary to effectuate orders entered by the court in the foreign receivership proceeding. A receiver appointed in an ancillary receivership in this state is required to comply with this chapter requiring notice to creditors or other parties in interest only as may be required by the superior court in the ancillary receivership.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 29](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2029); \]

## 7.60.280 - Resignation or removal of receiver.
1. The court shall remove or replace the receiver on application of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, the receiver, or any creditor, or on the court's own motion, if the receiver fails to execute and file the bond required by RCW 7.60.045, or if the receiver resigns or refuses or fails to serve for any reason, or for other good cause.

2. Upon removal, resignation, or death of the receiver, the court shall appoint a successor receiver if the court determines that further administration of the estate is required. Upon executing and filing a bond under RCW 7.60.045, the successor receiver shall immediately take possession of the estate and assume the duties of receiver.

3. Whenever the court is satisfied that the receiver so removed or replaced has fully accounted for and turned over to the successor receiver appointed by the court all of the property of the estate and has filed a report of all receipts and disbursements during the person's tenure as receiver, the court shall enter an order discharging that person from all further duties and responsibilities as receiver after notice and a hearing.

\[ [2004 c 165 § 30](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6189-S.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20165%20§%2030); \]

## 7.60.290 - Termination of receivership.
1. Upon distribution or disposition of all property of the estate, or the completion of the receiver's duties with respect to estate property, the receiver shall move the court to be discharged upon notice and a hearing.

2. The receiver's final report and accounting setting forth all receipts and disbursements of the estate shall be annexed to the petition for discharge and filed with the court.

3. Upon approval of the final report, the court shall discharge the receiver.

4. The receiver's discharge releases the receiver from any further duties and responsibilities as receiver under this chapter.

5. Upon motion of any party in interest, or upon the court's own motion, the court has the power to discharge the receiver and terminate the court's administration of the property over which the receiver was appointed. If the court determines that the appointment of the receiver was wrongfully procured or procured in bad faith, the court may assess against the person who procured the receiver's appointment (a) all of the receiver's fees and other costs of the receivership and (b) any other sanctions the court determines to be appropriate.
