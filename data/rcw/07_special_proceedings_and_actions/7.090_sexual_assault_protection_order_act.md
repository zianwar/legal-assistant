## 7.90.005 - Legislative declaration. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
Sexual assault is the most heinous crime against another person short of murder. Sexual assault inflicts humiliation, degradation, and terror on victims. According to the FBI, a woman is raped every six minutes in the United States. Rape is recognized as the most underreported crime; estimates suggest that only one in seven rapes is reported to authorities. Victims who do not report the crime still desire safety and protection from future interactions with the offender. Some cases in which the rape is reported are not prosecuted. In these situations, the victim should be able to seek a civil remedy requiring that the offender stay away from the victim. It is the intent of the legislature that the sexual assault protection order created by this chapter be a remedy for victims who do not qualify for a domestic violence order of protection.

## 7.90.053 - Service by mail—When authorized. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. In circumstances justifying service by publication under RCW 7.90.052, if the serving party files an affidavit stating facts from which the court determines that service by mail is just as likely to give actual notice as service by publication and that the serving party is unable to afford the cost of service by publication, the court may order that service be made by mail. The service must be made by any person over eighteen years of age, who is competent to be a witness, other than a party, by mailing copies of the order and other process to the party to be served at his or her last known address or any other address determined by the court to be appropriate. Two copies must be mailed, postage prepaid, one by ordinary first-class mail and the other by a form of mail requiring a signed receipt showing when and to whom it was delivered. The envelopes must bear the return address of the sender.

## 7.90.080 - Evidence. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. In proceedings for a sexual assault protection order and prosecutions for violating a sexual assault protection order, the prior sexual activity or the reputation of the petitioner is inadmissible except:

   a. As evidence concerning the past sexual conduct of the petitioner with the respondent when this evidence is offered by the respondent upon the issue of whether the petitioner consented to the sexual conduct with respect to which the offense is alleged; or

   b. When constitutionally required to be admitted.

2. No evidence admissible under this section may be introduced unless ruled admissible by the court after an offer of proof has been made at a hearing held in camera to determine whether the respondent has evidence to impeach the witness in the event that prior sexual activity with the respondent is denied. The offer of proof shall include reasonably specific information as to the date, time, and place of the past sexual conduct between the petitioner and the respondent. Unless the court finds that reasonably specific information as to date, time, or place, or some combination thereof, has been offered as to prior sexual activity with the respondent, counsel for the respondent shall be ordered to refrain from inquiring into prior sexual activity between the petitioner and the respondent. The court may not admit evidence under this section unless it determines at the hearing that the evidence is relevant and the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. The evidence shall be admissible at trial to the extent an order made by the court specifies the evidence that may be admitted and areas with respect to which the petitioner may be examined or cross-examined.

If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner has been a victim of nonconsensual sexual conduct or nonconsensual sexual penetration by the respondent, the court shall issue a sexual assault protection order; provided that the petitioner must also satisfy the requirements of RCW 7.90.110 for ex parte temporary orders or RCW 7.90.120 for final orders.

   b. The petitioner shall not be denied a sexual assault protection order because the petitioner or the respondent is a minor or because the petitioner did not report the assault to law enforcement. The court, when determining whether or not to issue a sexual assault protection order, may not require proof of physical injury on the person of the victim or proof that the petitioner has reported the sexual assault to law enforcement. Modification and extension of prior sexual assault protection orders shall be in accordance with this chapter.

2. The court may provide relief as follows:

   a. Restrain the respondent from having any contact, including nonphysical contact, with the petitioner directly, indirectly, or through third parties regardless of whether those third parties know of the order;

   b. Exclude the respondent from the petitioner's residence, workplace, or school, or from the day care or school of a child, if the victim is a child;

   c. Prohibit the respondent from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance from a specified location; and

   d. Order any other injunctive relief as necessary or appropriate for the protection of the petitioner.

3. In issuing the order, the court shall consider the provisions of RCW 9.41.800, and shall order the respondent to surrender, and prohibit the respondent from possessing, all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license as required in RCW 9.41.800.

4. In cases where the petitioner and the respondent are under the age of eighteen and attend the same public or private elementary, middle, or high school, the court, when issuing a protection order and providing relief, shall consider, among the other facts of the case, the severity of the act, any continuing physical danger or emotional distress to the petitioner, and the expense difficulty, and educational disruption that would be caused by a transfer of the respondent to another school. The court may order that the person restrained in the order not attend the public or approved private elementary, middle, or high school attended by the person under the age of eighteen protected by the order. In the event the court orders a transfer of the restrained person to another school, the parents or legal guardians of the person restrained in the order are responsible for transportation and other costs associated with the change of school by the person restrained in the order. The court shall send notice of the restriction on attending the same school as the person protected by the order to the public or approved private school the person restrained by the order will attend and to the school the person protected by the order attends.

5. Denial of a remedy may not be based, in whole or in part, on evidence that:

   a. The respondent was voluntarily intoxicated;

   b. The petitioner was voluntarily intoxicated; or

   c. The petitioner engaged in limited consensual sexual touching.

6. Monetary damages are not recoverable as a remedy.

7. A knowing violation of a court order issued under this section is punishable under RCW 26.50.110.

## 7.90.100 - Accountability for conduct of others. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
For the purposes of issuing a sexual assault protection order, deciding what relief should be included in the order, and enforcing the order, RCW 9A.08.020 shall govern whether the respondent is legally accountable for the conduct of another person.

\[ [2006 c 138 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2576-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20138%20§%2011); \]

## 7.90.110 - Ex parte temporary sexual assault protection orders—Issuance. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. An ex parte temporary sexual assault protection order shall issue if the petitioner satisfies the requirements of this subsection by a preponderance of the evidence. The petitioner shall establish that:

   a. The petitioner has been a victim of nonconsensual sexual conduct or nonconsensual sexual penetration by the respondent; and

   b. There is good cause to grant the remedy, regardless of the lack of prior service of process or of notice upon the respondent, because the harm which that remedy is intended to prevent would be likely to occur if the respondent were given any prior notice, or greater notice than was actually given, of the petitioner's efforts to obtain judicial relief.

2. In issuing the order, the court shall consider the provisions of RCW 9.41.800, and shall order the respondent to surrender, and prohibit the respondent from possessing, all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license as required in RCW 9.41.800.

3. If the respondent appears in court for this hearing for an ex parte temporary order, he or she may elect to file a general appearance and testify under oath. Any resulting order may be an ex parte temporary order, governed by this section.

4. If the court declines to issue an ex parte temporary sexual assault protection order, the court shall state the particular reasons for the court's denial. The court's denial of a motion for an ex parte temporary order shall be filed with the court.

A full hearing, as provided in this chapter, shall be set for not later than fourteen days from the issuance of the temporary order or not later than twenty-four days if service by publication or service by mail is permitted. If the court permits service by publication or service by mail, the court shall also reissue the ex parte temporary protection order not to exceed another twenty-four days from the date of reissuing the ex parte protection order. Except as provided in RCW 7.90.050, 7.90.052, or 7.90.053, the respondent shall be personally served with a copy of the ex parte temporary sexual assault protection order along with a copy of the petition and notice of the date set for the hearing.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this section or RCW 7.90.150, a final sexual assault protection order shall be effective for a fixed period of time or be permanent.

3. Any sexual assault protection order which would expire on a court holiday shall instead expire at the close of the next court business day.

4. The practice of dismissing or suspending a criminal prosecution in exchange for the issuance of a sexual assault protection order undermines the purposes of this chapter. This section shall not be construed as encouraging that practice.

\[ [2017 c 233 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5256-S.SL.pdf?cite=2017%20c%20233%20§%201); [2013 c 74 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1307-S.SL.pdf?cite=2013%20c%2074%20§%203); [2006 c 138 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2576-S.SL.pdf?cite=2006%20c%20138%20§%2013); \]

1. Any ex parte temporary or nonpermanent final sexual assault protection order may be renewed one or more times, as required.

2. The petitioner may apply for renewal of the order by filing a motion for renewal at any time within the three months before the order expires. The motion for renewal shall state the reasons why the petitioner seeks to renew the protection order.

3. [Empty]

   a. The court shall grant the motion for renewal unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a material change in circumstances such that the respondent is not likely to engage in or attempt to engage in physical or nonphysical contact with the petitioner when the order expires.

   b. For purposes of this subsection (3), a court shall determine whether there has been a material change in circumstances by considering only factors which address whether the respondent is likely to engage in or attempt to engage in physical or nonphysical contact with the petitioner when the order expires. The passage of time and compliance with the existing protection order shall not, alone, be sufficient to meet this burden of proof. The court may renew the sexual assault protection order for another fixed time period or may enter a permanent order as provided in this section.

   c. In determining whether there has been a material change in circumstances, the court may consider the following unweighted factors, and no inference is to be drawn from the order in which the factors are listed:

      i. Whether the respondent has committed or threatened sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, or other violent acts since the protection order was entered;

      ii. Whether the respondent has violated the terms of the protection order and the time that has passed since the entry of the order;

      iii. Whether the respondent has exhibited suicidal ideation or attempts since the protection order was entered;

      iv. Whether the respondent has been convicted of criminal activity since the protection order was entered;

      v. Whether the respondent has either acknowledged responsibility for acts of sexual assault that resulted in entry of the protection order or successfully completed sexual assault perpetrator treatment or counseling since the protection order was entered;

      vi. Whether the respondent has a continuing involvement with drug or alcohol abuse, if such abuse was a factor in the protection order;

      vii. Whether the respondent or petitioner has relocated to an area more distant from the other party, giving due consideration to the fact that acts of sexual assault may be committed from any distance such as via cybercrime;

      viii. Other factors relating to a material change in circumstances.

4. [Empty]

   a. If the motion is contested, upon receipt of the motion, the court shall order that a hearing be held not later than fourteen days from the date of the order.

   b. The court may schedule a hearing by telephone pursuant to local court rule, to reasonably accommodate a disability, or in exceptional circumstances to protect a petitioner from further nonconsensual sexual conduct or nonconsensual sexual penetration. The court shall require assurances of the petitioner's identity before conducting a telephonic hearing.

   c. The respondent shall be personally served not less than five court days prior to the hearing. If timely personal service cannot be made, the court shall set a new hearing date and shall either require additional attempts at obtaining personal service or permit service by publication as provided in RCW 7.90.052 or service by mail as provided in RCW 7.90.053. The court shall not require more than two attempts at obtaining personal service and shall permit service by publication or service by mail unless the petitioner requests additional time to attempt personal service. If the court permits service by publication or service by mail, the court shall set the hearing date not later than twenty-four days from the date of the order.

5. Renewals may be granted only in open court.

## 7.90.130 - Sexual assault protection orders—Contents. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. Any sexual assault protection order shall describe each remedy granted by the court, in reasonable detail and not by reference to any other document, so that the respondent may clearly understand what he or she must do or refrain from doing.

2. A sexual assault protection order shall further state the following:

   a. The name of each petitioner that the court finds was the victim of nonconsensual sexual conduct or nonconsensual sexual penetration by the respondent;

   b. The date and time the sexual assault protection order was issued, whether it is an ex parte temporary or final order, and the duration of the order;

   c. The date, time, and place for any scheduled hearing for renewal of that sexual assault protection order or for another order of greater duration or scope;

   d. For each remedy in an ex parte temporary sexual assault protection order, the reason for entering that remedy without prior notice to the respondent or greater notice than was actually given;

   e. For ex parte temporary sexual assault protection orders, that the respondent may petition the court, to reopen the order if he or she did not receive actual prior notice of the hearing and if the respondent alleges that he or she had a meritorious defense to the order or that the order or its remedy is not authorized by this chapter.

3. A sexual assault protection order shall include the following notice, printed in conspicuous type: "A knowing violation of this sexual assault protection order is a criminal offense under chapter 26.50 RCW and will subject a violator to arrest.

2. The sheriff of the county or the peace officers of the municipality in which the respondent resides shall serve the respondent personally unless the petitioner elects to have the respondent served by a private party. If the order includes a requirement under RCW 9.41.800 for the immediate surrender of all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license, the order must be served by a law enforcement officer.

3. If service by a sheriff or municipal peace officer is to be used, the clerk of the court shall have a copy of any order issued under this chapter electronically forwarded on or before the next judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order for service upon the respondent. Service of an order issued under this chapter shall take precedence over the service of other documents unless they are of a similar emergency nature.

5. Returns of service under this chapter shall be made in accordance with the applicable court rules.

7. If the court previously entered an order allowing service of the notice of hearing and temporary order of protection by publication under RCW 7.90.052 or service by mail under RCW 7.90.053, the court may permit service by publication or service by mail of the order of protection issued under this chapter.
