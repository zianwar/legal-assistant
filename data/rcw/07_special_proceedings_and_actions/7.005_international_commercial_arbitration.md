## 7.05.050 - Waiver of right to object.
A party who knows that any provision of this chapter from which the parties may derogate or any requirement under the arbitration agreement has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating the party's objection to such noncompliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided therefore, within such period of time, shall be deemed to have waived the party's right to object.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%205); \]

\[ [2015 c 276 § 7](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%207); \]

## 7.05.080 - Arbitration agreement—Definition and form.
1. For the purposes of this chapter, "arbitration agreement" is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not. An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.

2. The arbitration agreement shall be in writing.

3. An arbitration agreement is in writing if its content is recorded in any form, whether or not the arbitration agreement or contract has been concluded orally, by conduct, or by other means.

4. The requirement that an arbitration agreement be in writing is met by an electronic communication if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be useable for subsequent reference. For the purposes of this section, "electronic communication" means any communication that the parties make by means of data messages; and "data message" means information generated, sent, received, or stored by electronic, magnetic, optical, or similar means, including, but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex, or telecopy.

5. An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in an exchange of statements of claim and defense in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other.

6. The reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement in writing, provided that the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%208); \]

## 7.05.090 - Arbitration agreement—Substantive claim before court.
1. A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not later than when submitting the party's first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed.

2. Where an action referred to in subsection (1) of this section has been brought, arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commenced or continued, and an award made, while the issue is pending before the court.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 9](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%209); \]

## 7.05.100 - Arbitration agreement—Interim measures by court.
It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an interim measure of protection and for a court to grant such measure.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 10](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2010); \]

## 7.05.110 - Number of arbitrators—Immunity.
1. The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.

2. Failing such determination, the number of arbitrators shall be three.

3. An arbitrator has the immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of arbitrator under any statute or contract. The immunity afforded by this section shall supplement, and not supplant, any otherwise applicable common law or statutory immunity.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2011); \]

## 7.05.120 - Appointment of arbitrators.
1. No person shall be precluded by reason of the person's nationality from acting as an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

2. The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, subject to the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) of this section.

3. Failing such agreement:

   a. In an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator; if a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within thirty days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party, or if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the court specified in RCW 7.05.070; and

   b. In an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed, upon request of a party, by the court specified in RCW 7.05.070.

4. Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties:

   a. A party fails to act as required under such procedure;

   b. The parties, or two arbitrators, are unable to reach an agreement expected of them under such procedure; or

   c. A third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it under such procedure;

Any party may request the court specified in RCW 7.05.070 to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.

5. A decision on a matter entrusted by subsection (3) or (4) of this section to the court specified in RCW 7.05.070 shall be subject to no appeal. The court, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator and, in the case of a sole or third arbitrator, shall take into account as well the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than those of the parties.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 12](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2012); \]

## 7.05.130 - Disclosure requirements—Grounds for challenge.
1. When a person is approached in connection with the person's possible appointment as an arbitrator, the person shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to the person's impartiality or independence. An arbitrator, from the time of the arbitrator's appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, shall without delay disclose any such circumstances to the parties unless they have already been informed of them by the arbitrator.

2. An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence, or if the arbitrator does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties. A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by the party, or in whose appointment the party has participated, only for reasons of which the party becomes aware after the appointment has been made.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 13](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2013); \]

## 7.05.140 - Challenge procedure.
1. The parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section.

2. Failing such agreement, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within fifteen days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstance referred to in RCW 7.05.130(2), send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. Unless the challenged arbitrator withdraws from the arbitrator's office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge.

3. If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure of subsection (2) of this section is not successful, the challenging party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the challenge, the court specified in RCW 7.05.070 to decide on the challenge, which decision shall be subject to no appeal. While such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 14](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2014); \]

## 7.05.150 - Failure or impossibility to act.
1. If an arbitrator becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform the arbitrator's functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, the arbitrator's mandate terminates if the arbitrator withdraws from the arbitrator's office or if the parties agree on the termination. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of these grounds, any party may request the court specified in RCW 7.05.070 to decide on the termination of the mandate, which decision shall be subject to no appeal.

2. If, under this section or RCW 7.05.140(2), an arbitrator withdraws from the arbitrator's office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, this does not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this section or RCW 7.05.130(2).

\[ [2015 c 276 § 15](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2015); \]

## 7.05.160 - Appointment of substitute arbitrator.
Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates under RCW 7.05.140 or 7.05.150 or because of the arbitrator's withdrawal from office for any other reason or because of the revocation of the arbitrator's mandate by agreement of the parties or in any other case of termination of the arbitrator's mandate, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 16](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2016); \]

## 7.05.170 - Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction.
1. The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.

2. A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defense. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that the party has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may, in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.

3. The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in subsection (2) of this section either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, the court specified in RCW 7.05.070 to decide the matter, which decision shall be subject to no appeal. While such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 17](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2017); \]

## 7.05.180 - Power of arbitral tribunal to order interim measures.
1. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, grant interim measures.

2. An interim measure is any temporary measure, whether in the form of an award or in another form, by which, at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party to:

   a. Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute;

   b. Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, current or imminent harm or prejudice to the arbitral process itself;

   c. Provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may be satisfied; or

   d. Preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 18](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2018); \]

## 7.05.190 - Conditions of granting interim measures.
1. The party requesting an interim measure under RCW 7.05.180(2) (a), (b), and (c) shall satisfy the arbitral tribunal that:

   a. Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and

   b. There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the claim. The determination on this possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal in making any subsequent determination.

2. With regard to a request for an interim measure under RCW 7.05.180(2)(d), the requirements in subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section shall apply only to the extent the tribunal considers appropriate.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 19](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2019); \]

## 7.05.200 - Application for preliminary orders—Conditions for granting preliminary orders.

\[ [2015 c 276 § 36](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5227.SL.pdf?cite=2015%20c%20276%20§%2036); \]
