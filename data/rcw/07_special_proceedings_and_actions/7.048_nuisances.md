## 7.48.010 - Actionable nuisance defined.
The obstruction of any highway or the closing of the channel of any stream used for boating or rafting logs, lumber or timber, or whatever is injurious to health or indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to essentially interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of the life and property, is a nuisance and the subject of an action for damages and other and further relief.

## 7.48.020 - Who may sue—Judgment for damages—Warrant for abatement—Injunction.
Such action may be brought by any person whose property is, or whose patrons or employees are, injuriously affected or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance. If judgment be given for the plaintiff in such action, he or she may, in addition to the execution to enforce the same, on motion, have an order allowing a warrant to issue to the sheriff to abate and to deter or prevent the resumption of such nuisance. Such motion shall be allowed, of course, unless it appear on the hearing that the nuisance has ceased, or that such remedy is inadequate to abate or prevent the continuance of the nuisance, in which latter case the plaintiff may have the defendant enjoined.

\[ [1994 c 45 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6505-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%2045%20§%205); [1891 c 50 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1891c50.pdf?cite=1891%20c%2050%20§%201); Code 1881 § 606; [1877 p 126 § 611](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%20126%20§%20611); [1869 p 144 § 560](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%20144%20§%20560); [1854 p 207 § 406](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1854%20p%20207%20§%20406); RRS § 944; \]

## 7.48.030 - Issuance and execution of warrant.
If the order be made, the clerk shall thereafter, at any time within six months, when requested by the plaintiff, issue such warrant directed to the sheriff, requiring him or her forthwith to abate the nuisance at the expense of the defendant, and return the warrant as soon thereafter as may be, with his or her proceedings indorsed thereon. The expenses of abating the nuisance may be levied by the sheriff on the property of the defendant, and in this respect the warrant is to be deemed an execution against property.

\[ [2011 c 336 § 210](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5045.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20336%20§%20210); Code 1881 § 607; [1877 p 126 § 612](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%20126%20§%20612); [1869 p 145 § 561](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%20145%20§%20561); [1854 p 207 § 407](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1854%20p%20207%20§%20407); RRS § 945; \]

## 7.48.040 - Stay of issuance of warrant.
At any time before the order is made or the warrant issues, the defendant may, on motion to the court or judge thereof, have an order to stay the issue of such warrant for such period as may be necessary, not exceeding six months, to allow the defendant to abate the nuisance himself or herself, upon his or her giving bond to the plaintiff in a sufficient amount with one or more sureties, to the satisfaction of the court or judge thereof, that he or she will abate it within the time and in the manner specified in such order. The sureties shall justify as provided by law. If the defendant fails to abate such nuisance within the time specified, the warrant for the abatement of the nuisance may issue as if the same had not been stayed.

\[ [2011 c 336 § 211](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5045.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20336%20§%20211); [1957 c 51 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1957c51.pdf?cite=1957%20c%2051%20§%2011); Code 1881 § 608; [1877 p 127 § 613](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1877%20p%20127%20§%20613); [1869 p 145 § 562](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1869%20p%20145%20§%20562); RRS § 946; \]

Where the circumstantial proof warrants a determination that a person had knowledge of the moral nuisance prior to such service of process, the court shall make such finding.

\[ [1990 c 152 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c152.pdf?cite=1990%20c%20152%20§%203); 1979 c 1 § 3 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); \]

## 7.48.056 - Abate moral nuisance—Enjoin owner.

If such action is instituted by a private person, the complainant shall execute a bond to the person against whom complaint is made, with good and sufficient surety to be approved by the court or clerk thereof, in the sum of not less than five hundred dollars, to secure to the party enjoined the damages he or she may sustain if such action is wrongfully brought, and the court finds there was no reasonable grounds or cause for said action and the case is dismissed for that reason before trial or for want of prosecution. No bond shall be required of the attorney general, prosecuting attorney, city attorney, or city prosecutor, and no action shall be maintained against such public official for his or her official action when brought in good faith.

\[ [2011 c 336 § 212](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5045.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20336%20§%20212); 1979 c 1 § 5 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); \]

## 7.48.060 - Moral nuisance—Jurisdiction—Filing a complaint.
The action provided for in RCW 7.48.058 shall be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the property is located. Such action shall be commenced by the filing of a verified complaint alleging the facts constituting the nuisance. After the filing of said complaint, application for a temporary injunction may be made to the court in which the action is filed, or to a judge thereof, who shall grant a hearing within ten days after the filing.

\[ 1979 c 1 § 6 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); [1913 c 127 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1913c127.pdf?cite=1913%20c%20127%20§%202); RRS § 946-2; \]

## 7.48.062 - Moral nuisance—Restraining order—Violations.
Where such application for a temporary injunction is made, the court or judge thereof may, on application of the complainant showing good cause, issue an ex parte restraining order, restraining the defendant and all other persons from removing or in any manner interfering with the personal property and contents of the place where such nuisance is alleged to exist, until the decision of the court or judge granting or refusing such temporary injunction and until the further order of the court thereon, except that pending such decision, the stock in trade may not be so restrained, but an inventory and full accounting of all business transactions may be required.

The restraining order may be served by handing to and leaving a copy of such order with any person in charge of such place or residing therein, or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place at or upon one or more of the principal doors or entrances to such place, or by both such delivery and posting. The officer serving such restraining order shall forthwith make and return into court an inventory of the personal property and contents situated in and used in conducting or maintaining such nuisance.

Any violation of such restraining order is a contempt of court, and where such order is posted, mutilation or removal thereof while the same remains in force is a contempt of court if such posted order contains therein a notice to that effect.

\[ 1979 c 1 § 7 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); \]

## 7.48.064 - Moral nuisance—Hearing—Notice—Consolidation with trial.
A copy of the complaint, together with a notice of the time and place of the hearing of the application for a temporary injunction, shall be served upon the defendant at least three days before such hearing. The place may also be served by posting such papers in the same manner as is provided for in RCW 7.48.062 in the case of a restraining order. If the hearing is then continued at the instance of any defendant, the temporary writ as prayed shall be granted as a matter of course.

Before or after the commencement of the hearing of an application for a temporary injunction, the court, on application of either of the parties or on its own motion, may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the application for the temporary injunction. Any evidence received upon an application for a temporary injunction which would be admissible in the trial on the merits becomes a part of the record of the trial and need not be repeated as to such parties at the trial on the merits.

\[ 1979 c 1 § 8 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); \]

## 7.48.066 - Finding of moral nuisance—Orders.
If upon hearing, the allegations of the complaint are sustained to the satisfaction of the court or judge, the court or judge shall issue a temporary injunction without additional bond, restraining the defendant and any other person from continuing the nuisance.

If at the time the temporary injunction is granted, it further appears that the person owning, in control of, or in charge of the nuisance so enjoined had received three days notice of the hearing, then the court shall declare a temporary forfeiture of the use of the real property upon which such public nuisance is located and the personal property located therein, and shall forthwith issue an order closing such place against its use for any purpose until a final decision is rendered on the application for a permanent injunction, unless:

1. The person owning, in control of, or in charge of such nuisance shows to the satisfaction of the court or judge, by competent and admissible evidence which is subject to cross-examination, that the nuisance complained of has been abated by such person; or

2. The owner of such property, as a "good faith" lessor, has taken action to void said lease as is authorized by RCW 7.48.085.

Such order shall also continue in effect for such further period as the order authorized in RCW 7.48.062 provides. If no order has been issued pursuant to RCW 7.48.062, then an order restraining the removal or interference with the personal property and contents located therein shall be issued. Such restraining order shall be served and the inventory of such property shall be made and filed as provided for in RCW 7.48.062.

Such order shall also require such persons to show cause within thirty days why such closing order should not be made permanent, as provided for in RCW 7.48.078.

\[ 1979 c 1 § 9 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); \]

## 7.48.068 - Abatement of moral nuisance by owner—Effect on injunction.
The owner of any real or personal property to be closed or restrained, or which has been closed or restrained, may appear after the filing of the complaint and before the hearing on the application for a permanent injunction.

The court, if satisfied of the good faith of the owner of the real property and of the innocence on the part of any owner of the personal property of any knowledge of its use as a nuisance, and that with reasonable care and diligence such owner could not have known thereof shall, at the time of the hearing on the application for the temporary injunction and upon payment of all costs incurred and upon the filing of a bond by the owner of the real property with sureties to be approved by the clerk in the full value of the property to be ascertained by the court, conditioned that such owner will immediately abate the nuisance and prevent the same from being established or kept, refrain from issuing any order closing such real property or restraining the removal or interference with such personal property, and, if such temporary injunction has already been issued, shall cancel said order and shall deliver such real or personal property, or both, to the respective owners thereof. The release of any real or personal property under this section shall not release it from any judgment, lien, penalty, or liability to which it may be subjected by law.

\[ 1979 c 1 § 10 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); \]

## 7.48.070 - Moral nuisance—Priority of action on calendar.
The action provided for in RCW 7.48.058 shall be set down for trial at the first term of the court and shall have precedence over all other cases except crimes, election contests, or injunctions.

\[ 1979 c 1 § 11 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); [1913 c 127 § 3](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1913c127.pdf?cite=1913%20c%20127%20§%203); RRS § 946-3; \]

## 7.48.072 - Moral nuisance—Effects of admission or finding of guilt.
In such action, an admission or finding of guilty of any person under the criminal laws against lewdness, prostitution, or assignation at any such place is admissible for the purpose of proving the existence of such nuisance, and is prima facie evidence of such nuisance and of knowledge of, and of acquiescence and participation therein, on the part of the person charged with maintaining such nuisance.

\[ 1979 c 1 § 12 (Initiative Measure No. 335, approved November 8, 1977); \]

## 7.48.074 - Moral nuisance—Evidence of reputation—Admissibility.
At all hearings upon the merits, evidence of the general reputation of the building or place constituting the alleged nuisance, of the inmates thereof, and of those resorting thereto, is admissible for the purpose of proving the existence of such nuisance.

## 7.48.076 - Moral nuisance—Trial—Costs—Dismissal—Judgment.
If the action is brought by a person who is a citizen of the county, and the court finds that there were no reasonable grounds or probable cause for bringing said action, and the case is dismissed before trial for that reason or for want of prosecution, the costs, including attorneys' fees, may be taxed to such person.

If the existence of the nuisance is established upon the trial, a judgment shall be entered which shall perpetually enjoin the defendant and any other person from further maintaining the nuisance at the place complained of, and the defendant from maintaining such nuisance elsewhere.

If the complaint is filed by a person who is a citizen of the county, it shall not be dismissed except upon a sworn statement by the complainant and his or her attorney, setting forth the reason why the action should be dismissed and the dismissal approved by the prosecuting attorney in writing or in open court. If the judge is of the opinion that the action should not be dismissed, he or she may direct the prosecuting attorney to prosecute said action to judgment at the expense of the county, and if the action is continued for more than one term of court, any person who is a citizen of the county or has an office therein, or the attorney general, the prosecuting attorney, city attorney, or city prosecutor, may be substituted for the complainant and prosecute said action to judgment.

## 7.48.078 - Moral nuisance—Judgment—Penalties—Disposal of personal property.
If the existence of a nuisance is admitted or established in an action as provided for in RCW 7.48.058 or in a criminal proceeding, an order of abatement shall be entered as a part of the judgment in the case, which order shall direct the removal from the place of all personal property and contents used in conducting the nuisance and not already released under authority of the court as provided for in RCW 7.48.066 and 7.48.068, and shall direct the sale of such thereof as belong to the defendants notified or appearing, in the manner provided for the sale of chattels under execution. Lewd matter shall be destroyed and shall not be sold.

Such judgment shall impose a penalty of three hundred dollars for the maintenance of such nuisance, which penalty shall be imposed against the person or persons found to have maintained the nuisance, and, in case any owner or agent of the building found to have had actual or constructive notice of the maintenance of such nuisance, against such owner or agent, and against the building kept or used for the purposes of maintaining a moral nuisance, which penalty shall be collected by execution as in civil actions, and when collected, shall be paid into the current expense fund of the county in which the judgment is had.

Such order shall also require the renewal for one year of any bond furnished by the owner of the real property, as provided in RCW 7.48.068 or, if not so furnished, shall continue for one year any closing order issued at the time of granting the temporary injunction, or, if no such closing order was then issued, shall include an order directing the effectual closing of the place against its use for any purpose and keeping it closed for a period of one year unless sooner released.

The owner of any place closed and not released under bond may then appear and obtain such release in the manner and upon fulfilling the requirements provided in RCW 7.48.068.

Owners of unsold personal property and contents so seized must appear and claim the same within ten days after such order of abatement is made, and prove innocence to the satisfaction of the court of any knowledge of such use thereof, and that with reasonable care and diligence they could not have known thereof. If such innocence is established, such unsold personal property and contents shall be delivered to the owner, otherwise it shall be sold as provided in this section. For removing and selling the personal property and contents, the officer shall be entitled to charge and receive the same fees as he or she would for levying upon and selling like property on execution; and for closing the place and keeping it closed, a reasonable sum shall be allowed by the court.

## 7.48.305 - Agricultural activities and forest practices—Presumed reasonable and not a nuisance—Exception—Damages.
1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, agricultural activities conducted on farmland and forest practices, if consistent with good agricultural and forest practices and established prior to surrounding nonagricultural and nonforestry activities, are presumed to be reasonable and shall not be found to constitute a nuisance unless the activity or practice has a substantial adverse effect on public health and safety.

2. Agricultural activities and forest practices undertaken in conformity with all applicable laws and rules are presumed to be good agricultural and forest practices not adversely affecting the public health and safety for purposes of this section and RCW 7.48.300. An agricultural activity that is in conformity with such laws and rules shall not be restricted as to the hours of the day or day or days of the week during which it may be conducted.

3. The act of owning land upon which a growing crop of trees is located, even if the tree growth is being managed passively and even if the owner does not indicate the land's status as a working forest, is considered to be a forest practice occurring on the land if the crop of trees is located on land that is capable of supporting a merchantable stand of timber that is not being actively used for a use that is incompatible with timber growing. If the growing of trees has been established prior to surrounding nonforestry activities, then the act of tree growth is considered a necessary part of any other subsequent stages of forest practices necessary to bring a crop of trees from its planting to final harvest and is included in the provisions of this section.

4. Nothing in this section shall affect or impair any right to sue for damages.
