This assessment constitutes a lien against the property, and is binding upon successors in title only from the date the lien is recorded in the county in which the real property is located. This assessment is of equal rank with state, county, and municipal taxes and is assessed against the real property upon which cost was incurred unless such amount is previously paid.
