3. Evidence or information that is otherwise admissible or subject to discovery does not become inadmissible or protected from discovery solely by reason of its disclosure or use in a mediation.

\[ [2005 c 172 § 4](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5173-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20172%20§%204); \]

   d. Intentionally used to plan a crime, attempt to commit or commit a crime, or to conceal an ongoing crime or ongoing criminal activity;

   a. A criminal court proceeding involving a felony; or

   b. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a proceeding to prove a claim to rescind or reform or a defense to avoid liability on a contract arising out of the mediation.

5. Records of mediation communications that are privileged under this chapter are exempt from the requirements of chapter 42.56 RCW.
