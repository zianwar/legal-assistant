## 84.37.010 - Findings—Intent.
1. The legislature finds that there are an increasing number of economic and financial pressures causing hardships to many homeowners in the state of Washington. The legislature finds that the current housing crisis is a key barometer of the insecure economic situation facing working Washington families. The legislature finds that, among those hardships, increases in property taxes lead to undue stress on family budgets causing some homeowners to be at risk of losing their homes. The legislature finds that financial practices nationwide have led to an increasingly destabilized housing market across the country with impacts now being felt here in Washington. The legislature further finds that by establishing a property tax deferral program homeowners will be able to remain in their homes. The legislature further finds that acting now to stabilize the housing market is an important public purpose.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to: (a) Provide a property tax safe harbor for families in economic crisis; and (b) prevent existing homeowners from being driven from their homes because of overly burdensome property taxes.

## 84.37.040 - Deferral program administration.
1. Each claimant electing to defer payment of special assessments or real property tax obligations, or both, under this chapter must file with the county assessor, on forms prescribed by the department and supplied by the assessor, a written declaration thereof. The declaration to defer special assessments and/or real property taxes for any year must be filed no later than the first day of September of the year for which the deferral is sought; however, for good cause shown, the department may waive this requirement.

2. The declaration must designate the property to which the deferral applies, and must include a statement setting forth (a) a list of all members of the claimant's household, (b) the claimant's equity value in his or her residence, (c) facts establishing the eligibility for the deferral under the provisions of this chapter, and (d) any other relevant information required by the rules of the department. The declaration must be signed by the claimant subject to the penalties as provided in chapter 9A.72 RCW for false swearing.

3. The county assessor must determine if each claimant is granted a deferral for each year but the claimant has the right to appeal this determination to the county board of equalization, in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.40.038, whose decision is final as to the deferral of that year.

## 84.37.050 - Renewals—Requirement to reside on property.
1. The provisions of RCW 84.38.050(1)(b) apply to declarations to defer special assessments or property taxes, or both, for all years following the first year.

## 84.37.060 - Right to defer not reduced by contract or agreement.
A person's right to defer special assessments or property tax obligations, or both, under this chapter may not be reduced by contract or agreement.

\[ [2007 sp.s. c 2 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6178-S.SL.pdf?cite=2007%20sp.s.%20c%202%20§%206); \]

## 84.37.070 - State lien on property.
Whenever a person's special assessment or real property tax obligation, or both, is deferred under this chapter, the amount deferred and required to be paid pursuant to RCW 84.38.120 becomes a lien in favor of the state upon his or her property and has priority as provided in chapters 35.49, 35.50, 36.35, and 84.60 RCW. However, the interest of a mortgage or purchase contract holder who requires an accumulation of reserves out of which real estate taxes are paid has priority to said deferred lien. This lien may accumulate up to forty percent of the amount of the claimant's equity value in the property and the rate of interest must be an average of the federal short-term rate as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1274(d) plus two percentage points. The rate set for each new year is computed by taking an arithmetical average to the nearest percentage point of the federal short-term rate, compounded annually. That average must be calculated using the rates from four months: January, April, and July of the calendar year immediately preceding the new year, and October of the previous preceding year. The interest is calculated from the time it could have been paid before delinquency until such obligation is paid or the date that the obligation is charged off as finally uncollectible. In the case of a mobile home, the department of licensing must show the state's lien on the certificate of title for the mobile home. In the case of all other property, the department of revenue must file a notice of the deferral with the county recorder or auditor.

## 84.37.080 - Conditions under which deferment ends.

Upon the death of the claimant with an outstanding deferred special assessment lien or real property tax lien, or both, except a surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner who is qualified under this chapter may elect to incur the special assessment lien or real property tax lien, or both, which shall then be payable by that spouse or that domestic partner as provided in this section;
