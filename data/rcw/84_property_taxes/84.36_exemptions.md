   a. At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; or

   b. The home is subsidized under a federal department of housing and urban development program. The department of revenue must provide by rule a definition of homes eligible for exemption under this subsection (1)(b), consistent with the purposes of this section.

2. All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home for the aging that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt from taxation if the benefit of the exemption inures to the home and the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of the home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses the tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. The initial term of the exemption under this subsection must equal the term of the tax exempt bond used in connection with the financing program, or the term of the requirement to reserve dwelling units for low-income residents, whichever is shorter. If the financing program involves less than the entire home, only those dwelling units included in the financing program are eligible for total exemption. The department of revenue must provide by rule the requirements for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this subsection and the requirements for exemption including:

   a. The number or percentage of dwelling units required to be occupied by low-income residents, and a definition of low income;

   b. The type and character of the dwelling units, whether independent units or otherwise; and

   c. Any particular requirements for continuing care retirement communities.

3. A home for the aging is eligible for a partial exemption on the real property and a total exemption for the home's personal property if the home does not meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section because fewer than fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, as follows:

   a. A partial exemption must be allowed for each dwelling unit in a home occupied by a resident requiring assistance with activities of daily living.

   b. A partial exemption must be allowed for each dwelling unit in a home occupied by an eligible resident.

   c. A partial exemption must be allowed for an area jointly used by a home for the aging and by a nonprofit organization, association, or corporation currently exempt from property taxation under one of the other provisions of this chapter. The shared area must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property taxation under one of the other provisions of this chapter, such as kitchen, dining, and laundry areas.

   d. The amount of exemption must be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, less the assessed value of any area exempt under (c) of this subsection, by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational for which exemption is claimed and January 1st of each subsequent assessment year for which exemption is claimed.

4. To be exempt under this section, the property must be used exclusively for the purposes for which the exemption is granted, except as provided in RCW 84.36.805.

5. A home for the aging is exempt from taxation only if the organization operating the home is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal internal revenue code as existing on January 1, 1989, or such subsequent date as the director may provide by rule consistent with the purposes of this section.

6. In order for the home to be eligible for exemption under subsections (1)(a) and (3)(b) of this section, each eligible resident of a home for the aging must submit an income verification form to the county assessor by July 1st of the assessment year for which exemption is claimed. However, during the first year a home becomes operational, the county assessor must accept income verification forms from eligible residents up to December 31st of the assessment year. The income verification form must be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. An eligible resident who has filed a form for a previous year need not file a new form until there is a change in status affecting the person's eligibility.

7. In determining the true and fair value of a home for the aging for purposes of the partial exemption provided by subsection (3) of this section, the assessor must apply the computation method provided by RCW 84.34.060 and may consider only the use to which such property is applied during the years for which such partial exemptions are available and may not consider potential uses of such property.

8. As used in this section:

   a. "Eligible resident" means a person who:

      i. Occupied the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational. In each subsequent year, the eligible resident must occupy the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of January 1st of the assessment year for which the exemption is claimed. Confinement of the person to a hospital or nursing home does not disqualify the claim of exemption if the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or if the dwelling unit is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both; and

      ii. Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the exemption claim is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability as defined in RCW 84.36.383. Any surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death qualifies if the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and

      iii. Has a combined disposable income of no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by the federal department of housing and urban development for the county in which the person resides. For the purposes of determining eligibility under this section, a "cotenant" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident.

   b. "Combined disposable income" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of his or her spouse or domestic partner, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or his or her spouse or domestic partner or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by twelve. If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or domestic partner, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after the death of the spouse or domestic partner by twelve.

   c. "Disposable income" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal internal revenue code, as amended prior to January 1, 1989, or such subsequent date as the director may provide by rule consistent with the purpose of this section, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income:

      i. Capital gains, other than gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal internal revenue code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence;

      ii. Amounts deducted for loss;

      iii. Amounts deducted for depreciation;

      iv. Pension and annuity receipts;

      v. Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;

      vi. Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;

      vii. Federal social security act and railroad retirement benefits;

      viii. Dividend receipts; and

      ix. Interest received on state and municipal bonds.

   d. "Resident requiring assistance with activities of daily living" means a person who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and who would be at risk of nursing home placement without this assistance.

   e. "Home for the aging" means a residential housing facility that (i) provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal.

9. A for-profit home for the aging that converts to nonprofit status after June 11, 1992, and would otherwise be eligible for tax exemption under this section may not receive the tax exemption until five years have elapsed since the conversion. The exemption must then be ratably granted over the next five years.

The exemption is not nullified as a result of any of the uses listed in (a) or (b) of this subsection or RCW 84.36.805(8):

   a. The property is used by students, alumni, faculty, staff, or other persons or entities in a manner consistent with the educational, social, or athletic programs, including property used for related administrative and support functions, of the school or college and not for pecuniary gain or to promote business activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the school or college may contract with and permit the use of school or college property by persons or entities to provide school or college-related programs or services including, but not limited to, the provision of food services to students, faculty, and staff, the operation of a bookstore on campus, and the provision to the school or college of maintenance, operational, or administrative services without nullifying the exemption; or

   b. The property is used for pecuniary gain or to promote business activities as authorized by RCW 84.36.805, such uses to be measured separately with respect to each specific portion of such property. If exempt property is used as a sports or educational camp or program taught, operated, or conducted by a faculty member who is required or permitted to do so as part of his or her compensation package, the days when the property is so used will not be considered to be days when the property is used for nonexempt purposes.

The conservation districts must cooperate with the federal natural resource conservation service, other conservation districts, the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, and nonprofit organizations to assist landowners by working with them to obtain approved conservation plans so as to qualify for the exemption provided for in this section. As provided in subsection (3) of this section and RCW 89.08.440(2), a conservation district must initially certify that the best management practice benefits fish and wildlife habitat, water quality, or water quantity. A habitat conservation plan under the terms of the federal endangered species act is not considered a conservation plan for purposes of this exemption.

In the first filing year, the claim must contain the initial certification by the conservation district that the improvements for which exemption is sought were included under a written conservation plan approved by the conservation district including best management practices that benefit fish and wildlife habitat, water quality, or water quantity. Each subsequent filing year, the claim must contain a copy of the conservation district's initial certification made in the first filing year, along with the landowner's own certification for the current filing year.

   b. Such property interests are subject to an option, accepted in writing by the state, a city or a county, or department of the United States government, for the purchase thereof by the state, a city or a county, or the United States, at a price not exceeding the lesser of the following amounts: (i) The sum of the original purchase cost to such nonprofit corporation or association plus interest from the date of acquisition by such corporation or association at the rate of six percent per annum compounded annually to the date of the exercise of the option; or (ii) the appraised value of the property at the time of the granting of the option, as determined by the department of revenue or when the option is held by the United States, or by an appropriate agency thereof.

## 84.36.300 - Stocks of merchandise, goods, wares, or material—Aircraft parts, etc.—When eligible for exemption.
There shall be exempt from taxation a portion of each separately assessed stock of merchandise, as that word is defined in this section, owned or held by any taxpayer on the first day of January of any year computed by first multiplying the total amount of that stock of such merchandise, as determined in accordance with RCW 84.40.020, by a percentage determined by dividing the amount of such merchandise brought into this state by the taxpayer during the preceding year for that stock by the total additions to that stock by the taxpayer during that year, and then multiplying the result of the latter computation by a percentage determined by dividing the total out-of-state shipments of such merchandise by the taxpayer during the preceding year from that stock (and regardless of whether or not any such shipments involved a sale of, or a transfer of title to, the merchandise within this state) by the total shipments of such merchandise by the taxpayer during the preceding year from that stock. As used in this section, the word "merchandise" means goods, wares, merchandise, or material which were not manufactured in this state by the taxpayer and which were acquired by him or her (in any other manner whatsoever, including manufacture by him or her outside of this state) for the purpose of sale or shipment in substantially the same form in which they were acquired by him or her within this state or were brought into this state by him or her. Breaking of packages or of bulk shipments, packaging, repackaging, labeling, or relabeling shall not be considered as a change in form within the meaning of this section. A taxpayer who has made no shipments of merchandise, either out-of-state or in-state, during the preceding year, may compute the percentage to be applied to the stock of merchandise on the basis of his or her experience from March 1st of the preceding year to the last day of February of the current year, in lieu of computing the percentage on the basis of his or her experience during the preceding year. The rule of strict construction shall not apply to this section.

## 84.36.301 - Legislative finding and declaration for RCW  84.36.300.
The legislature hereby finds and declares that to promote the policy of a free and uninhibited flow of commerce as established by federal constitutional and legislative dictate, it is desirable to exempt from property taxation, according to the provisions of RCW 84.36.300, certain parts and equipment coming into the state of Washington to be placed in vehicles which are then transferred to the possession of out-of-state owners. The legislature further recognizes that the temporary existence of these parts and equipment within the state justifies a tax exempt status which serves to encourage the manufacture and assemblage of vehicles within the state thereby promoting increased economic activity and jobs for our residents.

Consent to the inspection of the records shall be executed as a part of the claim. The owner, his or her agent, or other person having custody of the inventory referred to herein shall retain within this state, for a period of at least two years from the date of the claim, the records referred to above.

## 84.36.379 - Residences—Property tax exemption—Findings.
The legislature finds that the property tax exemption authorized by Article VII, section 10 of the state Constitution should be made available on the basis of a retired person's ability to pay property taxes and that the best measure of a retired person's ability to pay taxes is that person's disposable income as defined in RCW 84.36.383.

## 84.36.381 - Residences—Property tax exemptions—Qualifications.
A person is exempt from any legal obligation to pay all or a portion of the amount of excess and regular real property taxes due and payable in the year following the year in which a claim is filed, and thereafter, in accordance with the following:

1. [Empty]

   a. The property taxes must have been imposed upon a residence which was occupied by the person claiming the exemption as a principal place of residence as of the time of filing. However, any person who sells, transfers, or is displaced from his or her residence may transfer his or her exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive an exemption on more than one residence in any year. Moreover, confinement of the person to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, adult family home, or home of a relative for the purpose of long-term care does not disqualify the claim of exemption if:

      i. The residence is temporarily unoccupied;

      ii. The residence is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner and/or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or

      iii. The residence is rented for the purpose of paying nursing home, hospital, assisted living facility, or adult family home costs.

   b. For the purpose of this subsection (1), "relative" means any individual related to the claimant by blood, marriage, or adoption;

2. The person claiming the exemption must have owned, at the time of filing, in fee, as a life estate, or by contract purchase, the residence on which the property taxes have been imposed or if the person claiming the exemption lives in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, such person must own a share therein representing the unit or portion of the structure in which he or she resides. For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community or state registered domestic partnership or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse or each domestic partner or each cotenant, and any lease for life is deemed a life estate;

3. [Empty]

   a. The person claiming the exemption must be:

      i. Sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the exemption claim is filed, or must have been, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability; or

      ii. A veteran of the armed forces of the United States entitled to and receiving compensation from the United States department of veterans affairs at:

          A.  A combined service-connected evaluation rating of eighty percent or higher; or

          B.  A total disability rating for a service-connected disability without regard to evaluation percent.

   b. However, any surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify if the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this section;

4. The amount that the person is exempt from an obligation to pay is calculated on the basis of combined disposable income, as defined in RCW 84.36.383. If the person claiming the exemption was retired for two months or more of the assessment year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by twelve. If the income of the person claiming exemption is reduced for two or more months of the assessment year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or the person's domestic partner, or when other substantial changes occur in disposable income that are likely to continue for an indefinite period of time, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after such occurrences by twelve. If it is necessary to estimate income to comply with this subsection, the assessor may require confirming documentation of such income prior to May 31 of the year following application;

5. [Empty]

   a. A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal [to] or less than income threshold 3 is exempt from all excess property taxes, the additional state property tax imposed under RCW 84.52.065(2), and the portion of the regular property taxes authorized pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and approved by the voters, if the legislative authority of the county or city imposing the additional regular property taxes identified this exemption in the ordinance placing the RCW 84.55.050 measure on the ballot; and

   b. [Empty]

      i. A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 2 but greater than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of fifty thousand dollars or thirty-five percent of the valuation of his or her residence, but not to exceed seventy thousand dollars of the valuation of his or her residence; or

      ii. A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of sixty thousand dollars or sixty percent of the valuation of his or her residence;

6. [Empty]

   a. For a person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal [to] or less than income threshold 3, the valuation of the residence is the assessed value of the residence on the later of January 1, 1995, or January 1st of the assessment year the person first qualifies under this section. If the person subsequently fails to qualify under this section only for one year because of high income, this same valuation must be used upon requalification. If the person fails to qualify for more than one year in succession because of high income or fails to qualify for any other reason, the valuation upon requalification is the assessed value on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person requalifies. If the person transfers the exemption under this section to a different residence, the valuation of the different residence is the assessed value of the different residence on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person transfers the exemption.

   b. In no event may the valuation under this subsection be greater than the true and fair value of the residence on January 1st of the assessment year.

## 84.36.385 - Residences—Claim for exemption—Forms—Change of status—Publication and notice of qualifications and manner of making claims.
1. A claim for exemption under RCW 84.36.381 as now or hereafter amended, may be made and filed at any time during the year for exemption from taxes payable the following year and thereafter and solely upon forms as prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. However, an exemption from tax under RCW 84.36.381 continues for no more than six years unless a renewal application is filed as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

2. A person granted an exemption under RCW 84.36.381 must inform the county assessor of any change in status affecting the person's entitlement to the exemption on forms prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue.

3. Each person exempt from taxes under RCW 84.36.381 in 1993 and thereafter must file with the county assessor a renewal application not later than December 31st of the year the assessor notifies such person of the requirement to file the renewal application. Renewal applications must be on forms prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue.

4. At least once every six years, the county assessor must notify those persons receiving an exemption from taxes under RCW 84.36.381 of the requirement to file a renewal application. The county assessor may also require a renewal application following an amendment of the income requirements set forth in RCW 84.36.381.

5. If the assessor finds that the applicant does not meet the qualifications as set forth in RCW 84.36.381, as now or hereafter amended, the claim or exemption must be denied but such denial is subject to appeal under the provisions of RCW 84.48.010 and in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.40.038. If the applicant had received exemption in prior years based on erroneous information, the taxes must be collected subject to penalties as provided in RCW 84.40.130 for a period of not to exceed five years.

6. The department and each local assessor is hereby directed to publicize the qualifications and manner of making claims under RCW 84.36.381 through 84.36.389, through communications media, including such paid advertisements or notices as it deems appropriate. Notice of the qualifications, method of making applications, the penalties for not reporting a change in status, and availability of further information must be included on or with property tax statements and revaluation notices for all residential property including mobile homes, except rental properties.

The adjusted thresholds must be rounded up to the nearest one thousand dollars. If the income threshold adjustment is negative, the income threshold for the prior year continues to apply. The department must adjust income thresholds for each county to reflect the most recent year available of estimated county median household incomes, including preliminary estimates or projections, as published by the office of financial management. For the purposes of this subsection, "county median household income" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 84.36.383.

9. Beginning with the adjustment made by March 1, 2024, as provided in subsection (8) of this section, and every second adjustment thereafter, if an income threshold in a county is not adjusted based on percentage of county median income, then the income threshold must be adjusted based on the growth of the seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) for the prior twelve month period as published by the United States bureau of labor statistics. In no case may the adjustment be greater than one percent. The adjusted thresholds must be rounded to the nearest one dollar. If the income threshold adjustment is negative, the income threshold for the prior year continues to apply.
