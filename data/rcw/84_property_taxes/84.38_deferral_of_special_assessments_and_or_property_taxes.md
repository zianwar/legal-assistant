## 84.38.010 - Legislative finding and purpose.
Savings once deemed adequate for retirement living have been rendered inadequate by increased tax rates, increased property values, and the failure of pension systems to adequately reflect such factors. It is therefore deemed necessary that the legislature, in addition to that tax exemption as provided for in RCW 84.36.381 through 84.36.389 as now or hereafter amended, allow retired persons to defer payment of special assessments on their residences, and to defer their real property tax obligations on their residences, an amount of up to eighty percent of their equity in said property. This deferral program is intended to assist retired persons in maintaining their dignity and a reasonable standard of living by residing in their own homes, providing for their own needs, and managing their own affairs without requiring assistance from public welfare programs.

\[ [1975 1st ex.s. c 291 § 26](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1975ex1c291.pdf?cite=1975%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20291%20§%2026); \]

## 84.38.030 - Conditions and qualifications for claiming deferral.
A claimant may defer payment of special assessments and/or real property taxes on up to eighty percent of the amount of the claimant's equity value in the claimant's residence if the following conditions are met:

1. The claimant must meet all requirements for an exemption for the residence under RCW 84.36.381, other than the age and income limits under RCW 84.36.381.

2. The claimant must be sixty years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the deferral claim is filed, or must have been, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability as defined in RCW 84.36.383. However, any surviving spouse, surviving domestic partner, heir, or devisee of a person who was receiving a deferral at the time of the person's death qualifies if the surviving spouse, surviving domestic partner, heir, or devisee is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this section.

3. The claimant must have a combined disposable income, as defined in RCW 84.36.383, equal to or less than the income threshold.

4. The claimant must have owned, at the time of filing, the residence on which the special assessment and/or real property taxes have been imposed. For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community, owned by domestic partners, or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse, each domestic partner, or each cotenant. A claimant who has only a share ownership in cooperative housing, a life estate, a lease for life, or a revocable trust does not satisfy the ownership requirement.

5. The claimant must have and keep in force fire and casualty insurance in sufficient amount to protect the interest of the state in the claimant's equity value. However, if the claimant fails to keep fire and casualty insurance in force to the extent of the state's interest in the claimant's equity value, the amount deferred may not exceed one hundred percent of the claimant's equity value in the land or lot only.

6. In the case of special assessment deferral, the claimant must have opted for payment of such special assessments on the installment method if such method was available.

The declaration must be signed by the claimant subject to the penalties as provided in chapter 9A.72 RCW for false swearing. The first declaration to defer filed in a county must include proof of the claimant's age acceptable to the assessor.

3. The county assessor must determine if each claimant is granted a deferral for each year but the claimant has the right to appeal this determination to the county board of equalization, in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.40.038, whose decision is final as to the deferral of that year.

## 84.38.100 - Lien of state, mortgage or purchase contract holder—Priority—Amount—Interest.
Whenever a person's special assessment and/or real property tax obligation is deferred under the provisions of this chapter, the amount deferred and required to be paid pursuant to RCW 84.38.120 becomes a lien in favor of the state upon his or her property and has priority as provided in chapters 35.49, 35.50, 36.35, and 84.60 RCW. However, the interest of a mortgage or purchase contract holder who is required to cosign a declaration of deferral under RCW 84.38.090, has priority to such deferred lien. This lien may accumulate up to eighty percent of the amount of the claimant's equity value in the property and must bear interest at the rate of five percent per year from the time it could have been paid before delinquency until said obligation is paid. However, when taxes are deferred as provided in RCW 84.64.050, the amount must bear interest at the rate of five percent per year from the date the declaration is filed until the obligation is paid or the date that the obligation is charged off as finally uncollectible. In the case of a mobile home, the department of licensing must show the state's lien on the certificate of title for the mobile home. In the case of all other property, the department of revenue must file a notice of the deferral with the county recorder or auditor.

## 84.38.110 - Duties of county assessor.
The county assessor must:

1. Immediately transmit a copy of each declaration to defer to the department of revenue. The department may audit any declaration and must notify the assessor as soon as possible of any claim where any factor appears to disqualify the claimant for the deferral sought.

2. Transmit a copy of each declaration to defer a special assessment to the local improvement district which imposed such assessment.

3. Compute the dollar tax rate for the county as if any deferrals provided by this chapter did not exist.

4. As soon as possible notify the department of revenue and the county treasurer of the amount of real property taxes deferred for that year and notify the department of revenue and the respective treasurers of municipal corporations of the amount of special assessments deferred for each local improvement district within such unit.
