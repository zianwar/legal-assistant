2.

The department of revenue shall furnish to each county assessor a copy of the rules and processes so formulated. The department of revenue may, from time to time, make such changes in the rules and processes so formulated as it deems advisable to accomplish the purpose thereof, and it shall inform all county assessors of such changes.

3. Visit the counties in the state, unless prevented by necessary official duties, for the investigation of the methods adopted by the county assessors and county boards of commissioners in the assessment and equalization of taxation of real and personal property; carefully examine into all cases where evasion of property taxation is alleged, and ascertain where existing laws are defective, or improperly or negligently administered.

Such taxpayer, upon the execution of a bond, with two or more sufficient sureties to be approved by the county auditor, payable to the state of Washington, in the penal sum of two hundred dollars and conditioned that if the petitioner shall fail in his or her appeal for a reduction of said levy or levies the taxpayer will pay the taxable costs of the hearings hereinafter provided, not exceeding the amount of such bond, may file a written complaint with the county auditor wherein such taxing district is located not later than ten days after the making and entering of such levy or levies, setting forth in such form and detail as the department of revenue shall by general rule prescribe, the taxpayer's objections to such levy or levies. Upon the filing of such complaint, the county auditor shall immediately transmit a certified copy thereof, together with a copy of the budget or estimates of such taxing district as finally adopted, including estimated revenues and such other information as the department of revenue shall by rule require, to the department of revenue. The department of revenue shall fix a date for a hearing on said complaint at the earliest convenient time after receipt of said record, which hearing shall be held in the county in which said taxing district is located, and notice of such hearing shall be given to the officials of such taxing district, charged with determining the amount of its levies, and to the taxpayer on said complaint by registered mail at least five days prior to the date of said hearing.

## 84.08.210 - Confidentiality and privilege of tax information—Exceptions—Penalty.
1. For purposes of this section, "tax information" means confidential income data and proprietary business information obtained by the department in the course of carrying out the duties now or hereafter imposed upon it in this title that has been communicated in confidence in connection with the assessment of property and that has not been publicly disseminated by the taxpayer, the disclosure of which would be either highly offensive to a reasonable person and not a legitimate concern to the public or would result in an unfair competitive disadvantage to the taxpayer.

2. Tax information is confidential and privileged, and except as authorized by this section, neither the department nor any other person may disclose tax information.

3. Subsection (2) of this section, however, does not prohibit the department from:

   a. Disclosing tax information to any county assessor or county treasurer;

   b. Disclosing tax information in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or an administrative proceeding in respect to taxes or penalties imposed under this title or Title 82 RCW or in respect to assessment or valuation for tax purposes of the property to which the information or facts relate;

   c. Disclosing tax information with the written permission of the taxpayer;

   d. Disclosing tax information to the proper officer of the tax department of any state responsible for the imposition or collection of property taxes, or for the valuation of property for tax purposes, if the other state grants substantially similar privileges to the proper officers of this state;

   e. Disclosing tax information that is also maintained by another Washington state or local governmental agency as a public record available for inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW or is a document maintained by a court of record not otherwise prohibited from disclosure;

   f. Disclosing tax information to a peace officer as defined in RCW 9A.04.110 or county prosecutor, for official purposes. The disclosure may be made only in response to a search warrant, subpoena, or other court order, unless the disclosure is for the purpose of criminal tax enforcement. A peace officer or county prosecutor who receives the tax information may disclose the tax information only for use in the investigation and a related court proceeding, or in the court proceeding for which the tax information originally was sought; or

   g. Disclosing information otherwise available under chapter 42.56 RCW.

4. A violation of this section constitutes a gross misdemeanor.

## 84.08.220 - Electronic communication of confidential property tax information.
1. The department may provide electronically any assessment, notice, or other information that is subject to the confidentiality provisions of RCW 84.08.210 or 84.40.340, to any person authorized to receive the information.

2. The department must use methods reasonably designed to protect information provided electronically as authorized in subsection (1) of this section from unauthorized disclosure. However, the provisions of this subsection (2) may be waived by a taxpayer. The waiver must be in writing and may be provided to the department electronically. A waiver continues until revoked in writing by the taxpayer. Such revocation may be provided to the department electronically in a manner provided or approved by the department.
