## 84.52.010 - Taxes levied or voted in specific amounts—Effect of constitutional and statutory limitations. (Effective until January 1, 2027.)
1. Except as is permitted under RCW 84.55.050, all taxes must be levied or voted in specific amounts.

2. The rate percent of all taxes for state and county purposes, and purposes of taxing districts coextensive with the county, must be determined, calculated and fixed by the county assessors of the respective counties, within the limitations provided by law, upon the assessed valuation of the property of the county, as shown by the completed tax rolls of the county, and the rate percent of all taxes levied for purposes of taxing districts within any county must be determined, calculated and fixed by the county assessors of the respective counties, within the limitations provided by law, upon the assessed valuation of the property of the taxing districts respectively.

3. When a county assessor finds that the aggregate rate of tax levy on any property, that is subject to the limitations set forth in RCW 84.52.043 or 84.52.050, exceeds the limitations provided in either of these sections, the assessor must recompute and establish a consolidated levy in the following manner:

   a. The full certified rates of tax levy for state, county, county road district, regional transit authority, and city or town purposes must be extended on the tax rolls in amounts not exceeding the limitations established by law; however, any state levy takes precedence over all other levies and may not be reduced for any purpose other than that required by RCW 84.55.010. If, as a result of the levies imposed under RCW 36.54.130, 36.69.145 by a park and recreation district described under (a)(vii) of this subsection (3), 84.34.230, 84.52.069, 84.52.105, the portion of the levy by a metropolitan park district that was protected under RCW 84.52.120, 84.52.125, 84.52.135, and 84.52.140, and the portion of the levy by a flood control zone district that was protected under RCW 84.52.816, the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, then these levies must be reduced as follows:

      i. The portion of the levy by a flood control zone district that was protected under RCW 84.52.816 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated;

      ii. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, the levy imposed by a county under RCW 84.52.140 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated;

      iii. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, the portion of the levy by a fire protection district or regional fire protection service authority that is protected under RCW 84.52.125 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated;

      iv. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, the levy imposed by a county under RCW 84.52.135 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated;

      v. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, the levy imposed by a ferry district under RCW 36.54.130 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated;

      vi. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, the portion of the levy by a metropolitan park district that is protected under RCW 84.52.120 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated;

      vii. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, then the levies imposed under RCW 36.69.145 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated. This subsection (3)(a)(vii) only applies to a park and recreation district located on an island and within a county with a population exceeding 2,000,000;

      viii. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, then the levies imposed under RCW 84.34.230, 84.52.105, and any portion of the levy imposed under RCW 84.52.069 that is in excess of 30 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, must be reduced on a pro rata basis until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or must be eliminated; and

      ix. If the combined rate of regular property tax levies that are subject to the one percent limitation still exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property, then the 30 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of tax levy imposed under RCW 84.52.069 must be reduced until the combined rate no longer exceeds one percent of the true and fair value of any property or eliminated.

   b. The certified rates of tax levy subject to these limitations by all junior taxing districts imposing taxes on such property must be reduced or eliminated as follows to bring the consolidated levy of taxes on such property within the provisions of these limitations:

      i. First, the certified property tax levy authorized under RCW 84.52.821 must be reduced on a pro rata basis or eliminated;

      ii. Second, if the consolidated tax levy rate still exceeds these limitations, the certified property tax levy rates of those junior taxing districts authorized under RCW 36.68.525, 36.69.145 except a park and recreation district described under (a)(vii) of this subsection, 35.95A.100, and 67.38.130 must be reduced on a pro rata basis or eliminated;

      iii. Third, if the consolidated tax levy rate still exceeds these limitations, the certified property tax levy rates of flood control zone districts other than the portion of a levy protected under RCW 84.52.816 must be reduced on a pro rata basis or eliminated;

      iv. Fourth, if the consolidated tax levy rate still exceeds these limitations, the certified property tax levy rates of all other junior taxing districts, other than fire protection districts, regional fire protection service authorities, library districts, the first 50 cent[s] per $1,000 of assessed valuation levies for metropolitan park districts, and the first 50 cent[s] per $1,000 of assessed valuation levies for public hospital districts, must be reduced on a pro rata basis or eliminated;

      v. Fifth, if the consolidated tax levy rate still exceeds these limitations, the first 50 cent[s] per $1,000 of assessed valuation levies for metropolitan park districts created on or after January 1, 2002, must be reduced on a pro rata basis or eliminated;

      vi. Sixth, if the consolidated tax levy rate still exceeds these limitations, the certified property tax levy rates authorized to fire protection districts under RCW 52.16.140 and 52.16.160 and regional fire protection service authorities under RCW 52.26.140(1) (b) and (c) must be reduced on a pro rata basis or eliminated; and

      vii. Seventh, if the consolidated tax levy rate still exceeds these limitations, the certified property tax levy rates authorized for fire protection districts under RCW 52.16.130, regional fire protection service authorities under RCW 52.26.140(1)(a), library districts, metropolitan park districts created before January 1, 2002, under their first 50 cent[s] per $1,000 of assessed valuation levy, and public hospital districts under their first 50 cent[s] per $1,000 of assessed valuation levy, must be reduced on a pro rata basis or eliminated.

## 84.52.018 - Calculation of tax levy rates when the assessment of highly valued property is in dispute.
Whenever any property value or claim for exemption or cancellation of a property assessment is appealed to the state board of tax appeals or court of competent jurisdiction and the dollar difference between the total value asserted by the taxpayer and the total value asserted by the opposing party exceeds one-fourth of one percent of the total assessed value of property in the county, the assessor shall use only that portion of the total value which is not in controversy for purposes of computing the levy rates and extending the tax on the tax roll in accordance with this chapter, unless the state board of tax appeals has issued its determination at the time of extending the tax.

When the state board of tax appeals or court of competent jurisdiction makes its final determination, the proper amount of tax shall be extended and collected for each taxing district if this has not already been done. The amount of tax collected and extended shall include interest at the rate of nine percent per year on the amount of the board's final determination minus the amount not in controversy. The interest shall accrue from the date the taxes on the amount not in controversy were first due and payable. Any amount extended in excess of that permitted by chapter 84.55 RCW shall be held in abeyance and used to reduce the levy rates of the next succeeding levy.

The limitations imposed by RCW 84.52.050 through 84.52.056, and RCW 84.52.043 shall not prevent the levy of additional taxes by any taxing district, except school districts and fire protection districts, in which a larger levy is necessary in order to prevent the impairment of the obligation of contracts. As used in this section, the term "taxing district" means any county, metropolitan park district, park and recreation service area, park and recreation district, water-sewer district, solid waste disposal district, public facilities district, flood control zone district, county rail district, service district, public hospital district, road district, rural county library district, island library district, rural partial-county library district, intercounty rural library district, cemetery district, city, town, transportation benefit district, emergency medical service district with a population density of less than one thousand per square mile, cultural arts, stadium, and convention district, ferry district, city transportation authority, or regional fire protection service authority.

## 84.52.053 - Levies by school districts authorized—When—Procedure.
1. The limitations imposed by RCW 84.52.050 through 84.52.056, and 84.52.043 shall not prevent the levy of taxes by school districts, when authorized so to do by the voters of such school district in the manner and for the purposes and number of years allowable under Article VII, section 2(a) and Article IX, section 1 of the Constitution of this state. Elections for such taxes shall be held in the year in which the levy is made or, in the case of propositions authorizing two-year through four-year levies for enrichment funding for a school district, authorizing two-year levies for transportation vehicle funds established in RCW 28A.160.130 or authorizing two-year through six-year levies to support the construction, modernization, or remodeling of school facilities, which includes the purposes of RCW 28A.320.330(2) (f) and (g), in the year in which the first annual levy is made.

2. [Empty]

   a. Once additional tax levies have been authorized for enrichment funding for a school district for a two-year through four-year period as provided under subsection (1) of this section, no further additional tax levies for enrichment funding for the district for that period may be authorized, except for additional levies to provide for subsequently enacted increases affecting the district's maximum levy.

   b. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, any school district that is required to annex or receive territory pursuant to a dissolution of a financially insolvent school district pursuant to RCW 28A.315.225 may call either a replacement or supplemental levy election within the school district, including the territory annexed or transferred, as follows:

      i. An election for a proposition authorizing two-year through four-year levies for enrichment funding for a school district may be called and held before the effective date of dissolution to replace existing enrichment levies and to provide for increases due to the dissolution.

      ii. An election for a proposition authorizing additional tax levies may be called and held before the effective date of dissolution to provide for increases due to the dissolution.

      iii. In the event a replacement levy election under (b)(i) of this subsection is held but does not pass, the affected school district may subsequently hold a supplemental levy election pursuant to (b)(ii) of this subsection if the supplemental levy election is held before the effective date of dissolution. In the event a supplemental levy election is held under (b)(ii) of this subsection but does not pass, the affected school district may subsequently hold a replacement levy election pursuant to (b)(i) of this subsection if the replacement levy election is held before the effective date of dissolution. Failure of a replacement levy or supplemental levy election does not affect any previously approved and existing enrichment levy within the affected school district or districts.

   c. For the purpose of applying the limitation of this subsection (2), a two-year through six-year levy to support the construction, modernization, or remodeling of school facilities shall not be deemed to be a tax levy for enrichment funding for a school district.

3. A special election may be called and the time therefor fixed by the board of school directors, by giving notice thereof by publication in the manner provided by law for giving notices of general elections, at which special election the proposition authorizing such excess levy shall be submitted in such form as to enable the voters favoring the proposition to vote "yes" and those opposed thereto to vote "no."

   a. Beginning September 1, 2018, school districts may use enrichment levies solely to enrich the state's statutory program of basic education as authorized under RCW 28A.150.276.

   b. Beginning with propositions for enrichment levies for collection in calendar year 2020 and thereafter, a district must receive approval of an enrichment levy expenditure plan from the superintendent of public instruction under RCW 28A.505.240 before submission of the proposition to the voters.

## 84.52.0531 - Enrichment levies by school districts—Maximum dollar amount—Enrichment levy expenditure plan approval—Rules—Deposit of funds.
1. Beginning with taxes levied for collection in 2020, the maximum dollar amount which may be levied by or for any school district for enrichment levies under RCW 84.52.053 is equal to the lesser of two dollars and fifty cents per thousand dollars of the assessed value of property in the school district or the maximum per-pupil limit. This maximum dollar amount shall be reduced accordingly as provided under RCW 43.09.2856(2).

2. The definitions in this subsection apply to this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

   a. For the purpose of this section, "inflation" means the percentage change in the seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers, Seattle area, for the most recent 12-month period as of September 25th of the year before the taxes are payable, using the official current base compiled by the United States bureau of labor statistics.

   b. "Maximum per-pupil limit" means:

      i. Two thousand five hundred dollars, as increased by inflation beginning with property taxes levied for collection in 2020, multiplied by the number of average annual full-time equivalent students enrolled in the school district in the prior school year, for school districts with fewer than forty thousand annual full-time equivalent students enrolled in the school district in the prior school year; or

      ii. Three thousand dollars, as increased by inflation beginning with property taxes levied for collection in 2020, multiplied by the number of average annual full-time equivalent students enrolled in the school district in the prior school year, for school districts with forty thousand or more annual full-time equivalent students enrolled in the school district in the prior school year.

   c. "Open for in-person instruction to all students" means that all students in all grades have the option to participate in at least 40 hours of planned in-person instruction per month and the school follows state department of health guidance and recommendations for resuming in-person instruction to the greatest extent practicable.

   d. "Prior school year" means the most recent school year completed prior to the year in which the levies are to be collected, except as follows:

      i. In the 2022 calendar year, if 2019-20 school year average annual full-time equivalent enrollment is greater than the school district's 2020-21 school year average annual full-time equivalent enrollment and the school district is open for in-person instruction to all students by the beginning of the 2021-22 school year, "prior school year" means the 2019-20 school year.

      ii. In the 2023 calendar year, if 2019-20 school year average annual full-time equivalent enrollment is greater than the school district's 2021-22 school year average annual full-time equivalent enrollment and the school district was open for in-person instruction to all students by the beginning of the 2021-22 school year, "prior school year" means the 2019-20 school year.

3. For districts in a high/nonhigh relationship, the enrollments of the nonhigh students attending the high school shall only be counted by the nonhigh school districts for purposes of funding under this section.

4. For school districts participating in an innovation academy cooperative established under RCW 28A.340.080, enrollments of students attending the academy shall be adjusted so that each participant district receives its proportional share of student enrollments for purposes of funding under this section.

5. Beginning with propositions for enrichment levies for collection in calendar year 2020 and thereafter, a district must receive approval of an enrichment levy expenditure plan under RCW 28A.505.240 before submission of the proposition to the voters.

6. The superintendent of public instruction shall develop rules and regulations and inform school districts of the pertinent data necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

7. Beginning with taxes levied for collection in 2018, enrichment levy revenues must be deposited in a separate subfund of the school district's general fund pursuant to RCW 28A.320.330, and for the 2018-19 school year are subject to the restrictions of RCW 28A.150.276 and the audit requirements of RCW 43.09.2856.

8. Funds collected from levies for transportation vehicles, construction, modernization, or remodeling of school facilities as established in RCW 84.52.053 are not subject to the levy limitations in subsections (1) through (5) of this section.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a permanent tax levy under this section, or the initial imposition of a six-year or ten-year levy under this section, must be specifically authorized by a majority of at least three-fifths of the registered voters thereof approving a proposition authorizing the levies submitted at a general or special election, at which election the number of persons voting "yes" on the proposition must constitute three-fifths of a number equal to forty percent of the total number of voters voting in such taxing district at the last preceding general election when the number of registered voters voting on the proposition does not exceed forty percent of the total number of voters voting in such taxing district in the last preceding general election; or by a majority of at least three-fifths of the registered voters thereof voting on the proposition when the number of registered voters voting on the proposition exceeds forty percent of the total number of voters voting in such taxing district in the last preceding general election. The subsequent approval of a six-year or ten-year tax levy under this section must be specifically authorized by a majority of the registered voters thereof approving a proposition authorizing the levies submitted at a general or special election. If the entire region comprising a newly formed regional fire protection service authority was subject to the levy authorized under this section immediately prior to the creation of the authority under chapter 52.26 RCW, the initial imposition of a six-year or ten-year tax levy under this section may be approved by a majority of the registered voters thereof approving the creation of the authority and the related service plan. Ballot propositions must conform with RCW 29A.36.210. A taxing district may not submit to the voters at the same election multiple propositions to impose a levy under this section.

3. A taxing district imposing a permanent levy under this section must provide for separate accounting of expenditures of the revenues generated by the levy.

Within ten days, the filing officer must confer with the petitioner concerning form and style of the petition, issue the petition an identification number, and secure an accurate, concise, and positive ballot title from the designated local official. The petitioner has thirty days in which to secure the signatures of not less than fifteen percent of the registered voters of the taxing district, as of the last general election, upon petition forms which contain the ballot title and the full text of the measure to be referred. The filing officer must verify the sufficiency of the signatures on the petition and, if sufficient valid signatures are properly submitted, must certify the referendum measure to the next election within the taxing district if one is to be held within one hundred eighty days from the date of filing of the referendum petition, or at a special election to be called for that purpose in accordance with RCW 29A.04.330.

6. If a county levies a tax under this section, no taxing district within the county may levy a tax under this section. If a regional fire protection service authority imposes a tax under this section, no other taxing district that is a participating fire protection jurisdiction in the regional fire protection service authority may levy a tax under this section. No other taxing district may levy a tax under this section if another taxing district has levied a tax under this section within its boundaries: PROVIDED, That if a county levies less than fifty cents per thousand dollars of the assessed value of property, then any other taxing district may levy a tax under this section equal to the difference between the rate of the levy by the county and fifty cents: PROVIDED FURTHER, That if a taxing district within a county levies this tax, and the voters of the county subsequently approve a levying of this tax, then the amount of the taxing district levy within the county must be reduced, when the combined levies exceed fifty cents. Whenever a tax is levied countywide, the service must, insofar as is feasible, be provided throughout the county: PROVIDED FURTHER, That no countywide levy proposal may be placed on the ballot without the approval of the legislative authority of a majority of at least seventy-five percent of all cities exceeding a population of fifty thousand within the county: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That this section and RCW 36.32.480 may not prohibit any city or town from levying an annual excess levy to fund emergency medical services: AND PROVIDED, FURTHER, That if a county proposes to impose tax levies under this section, no other ballot proposition authorizing tax levies under this section by another taxing district in the county may be placed before the voters at the same election at which the county ballot proposition is placed: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That any taxing district emergency medical service levy that is limited in duration and that is authorized subsequent to a county emergency medical service levy that is limited in duration, expires concurrently with the county emergency medical service levy. A fire protection district that has annexed an area described in subsection (10) of this section may levy the maximum amount of tax that would otherwise be allowed, notwithstanding any limitations in this subsection (6).

7. The limitations in RCW 84.52.043 do not apply to the tax levy authorized in this section.

8. If a ballot proposition approved under subsection (2) of this section did not impose the maximum allowable levy amount authorized for the taxing district under this section, any future increase up to the maximum allowable levy amount must be specifically authorized by the voters in accordance with subsection (2) of this section at a general or special election.

9. The limitation in RCW 84.55.010 does not apply to the first levy imposed pursuant to this section following the approval of such levy by the voters pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.

10. For purposes of imposing the tax authorized under this section, the boundary of a county with a population greater than one million five hundred thousand does not include all of the area of the county that is located within a city that has a boundary in two counties, if the locally assessed value of all the property in the area of the city within the county having a population greater than one million five hundred thousand is less than two hundred fifty million dollars.

11. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

    a. "Fire protection jurisdiction" means a fire protection district, city, town, Indian tribe, or port district; and

    b. "Participating fire protection jurisdiction" means a fire protection district, city, town, Indian tribe, or port district that is represented on the governing board of a regional fire protection service authority.

## 84.52.080 - Extension of taxes on rolls—Form of certificate—Delivery to treasurer.
1. The county assessor must extend the taxes upon the tax rolls in the form prescribed in this section. The rate percent necessary to raise the amounts of taxes levied for state and county purposes, and for purposes of taxing districts coextensive with the county, must be computed upon the assessed value of the property of the county. The rate percent necessary to raise the amount of taxes levied for any taxing district within the county must be computed upon the assessed value of the property of the district. All taxes assessed against any property must be added together and extended on the rolls in a column headed consolidated or total tax. In extending any tax, whenever the tax amounts to a fractional part of a cent greater than one-half of a cent it must be rounded up to one cent, and whenever it amounts to one-half of a cent or less it must be dropped. The amount of all taxes must be entered in the proper columns, as shown by entering the rate percent necessary to raise the consolidated or total tax and the total tax assessed against the property.

2. For the purpose of computing the rate necessary to raise the amount of any excess levy in a taxing district entitled to a distribution under RCW 84.33.081, other than the state, the county assessor must add the district's timber assessed value, as defined in RCW 84.33.035, to the assessed value of the property. However, for school districts enrichment levies, only one-half of the district's timber assessed value or eighty percent of the timber roll of the district in calendar year 1983 as determined under chapter 84.33 RCW, whichever is greater, must be added to the assessed value of the property.

3. Upon the completion of such tax extension, it is the duty of the county assessor to make in each assessment book, tax roll or list a certificate in the following form:

I, . . . . . ., assessor of . . . . . . county, state of Washington, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a correct list of taxes levied on the real and personal property in the county of . . . . . . for the year two thousand . . . . . .Witness my hand this . . . . day of . . . . . ., 20. . . . . . ., County Assessor

## 84.52.085 - Property tax errors.
1. If an error has occurred in the levy of property taxes that has caused all taxpayers within a taxing district, other than the state, to pay an incorrect amount of property tax, the assessor shall correct the error by making an appropriate adjustment to the levy for that taxing district in the succeeding year. The adjustment shall be made without including any interest. If the governing authority of the taxing district determines that the amount of the adjustment in the succeeding year is so large as to cause a hardship for the taxing district or the taxpayers within the district, the adjustment may be made on a proportional basis over a period of not more than three consecutive years.

   a. A correction of an error in the levying of property taxes shall not be made for any period more than three years preceding the year in which the error is discovered.

   b. When calculating the levy limitation under chapter 84.55 RCW for levies made following the discovery of an error, the assessor shall determine and use the correct levy amount for the year or years being corrected as though the error had not occurred. The amount of the adjustment determined under this subsection (1) shall not be considered when calculating the levy limitation.

   c. If the taxing district in which a levy error has occurred does not levy property taxes in the year the error is discovered, or for a period of more than three years subsequent to the year the error was discovered, an adjustment shall not be made.

2. If an error has occurred in the distribution of property taxes so that property tax collected has been incorrectly distributed to a taxing district or taxing districts wholly or partially within a county, the treasurer of the county in which the error occurred shall correct the error by making an appropriate adjustment to the amount distributed to that taxing district or districts in the succeeding year. The adjustment shall be made without including any interest. If the treasurer, in consultation with the governing authority of the taxing district or districts affected, determines that the amount of the adjustment in the succeeding year is so large as to cause a hardship for the taxing district or districts, the adjustment may be made on a proportional basis over a period of not more than three consecutive years. A correction of an error in the distribution of property taxes shall not be made for any period more than three years preceding the year in which the error is discovered.

If both a county, and a city or town within the county, impose levies authorized under this section, the levies of the last jurisdiction to receive voter approval for the levies must be reduced or eliminated so that the combined rates of these levies may not exceed fifty cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation in any area within the county.

   b. The governing body of the county, city, or town adopts an affordable housing financing plan to serve as the plan for expenditure of funds raised by a levy authorized under this section, and the governing body determines that the affordable housing financing plan is consistent with either the locally adopted or state-adopted comprehensive housing affordability strategy, required under the Cranston-Gonzalez national affordable housing act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12701, et seq.), as amended.

3. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
