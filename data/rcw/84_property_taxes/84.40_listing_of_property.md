## 84.40.030 - Basis of valuation, assessment, appraisal—One hundred percent of true and fair value—Exceptions—Leasehold estates—Real property—Appraisal—Comparable sales.
1. All property must be valued at one hundred percent of its true and fair value in money and assessed on the same basis unless specifically provided otherwise by law.

2. Taxable leasehold estates must be valued at such price as they would bring at a fair, voluntary sale for cash without any deductions for any indebtedness owed including rentals to be paid.

3. The true and fair value of real property for taxation purposes (including property upon which there is a coal or other mine, or stone or other quarry) must be based upon the following criteria:

   a. Any sales of the property being appraised or similar properties with respect to sales made within the past five years. The appraisal must be consistent with the comprehensive land use plan, development regulations under chapter 36.70A RCW, zoning, and any other governmental policies or practices in effect at the time of appraisal that affect the use of property, as well as physical and environmental influences. An assessment may not be determined by a method that assumes a land usage or highest and best use not permitted, for that property being appraised, under existing zoning or land use planning ordinances or statutes or other government restrictions. The appraisal must also take into account: (i) In the use of sales by real estate contract as similar sales, the extent, if any, to which the stated selling price has been increased by reason of the down payment, interest rate, or other financing terms; and (ii) the extent to which the sale of a similar property actually represents the general effective market demand for property of such type, in the geographical area in which such property is located. Sales involving deed releases or similar seller-developer financing arrangements may not be used as sales of similar property.

   b. In addition to sales as defined in subsection (3)(a) of this section, consideration may be given to cost, cost less depreciation, reconstruction cost less depreciation, or capitalization of income that would be derived from prudent use of the property, as limited by law or ordinance. Consideration should be given to any agreement, between an owner of rental housing and any government agency, that restricts rental income, appreciation, and liquidity; and to the impact of government restrictions on operating expenses and on ownership rights in general of such housing. In the case of property of a complex nature, or being used under terms of a franchise from a public agency, or operating as a public utility, or property not having a record of sale within five years and not having a significant number of sales of similar property in the general area, the provisions of this subsection must be the dominant factors in valuation. When provisions of this subsection are relied upon for establishing values the property owner must be advised upon request of the factors used in arriving at such value.

   c. In valuing any tract or parcel of real property, the true and fair value of the land, exclusive of structures thereon must be determined; also the true and fair value of structures thereon, but the valuation may not exceed the true and fair value of the total property as it exists. In valuing agricultural land, growing crops must be excluded. For purposes of this subsection (3)(c), "growing crops" does not include cannabis as defined under RCW 69.50.101.

## 84.40.031 - Valuation of timber and timberlands—Criteria established.
Based upon the study as directed by house concurrent resolution No. 10 of the thirty-seventh session of the legislature relating to the taxation of timber and timberlands, the legislature hereby establishes the criteria set forth in RCW 84.40.031 through 84.40.033 as standards for the valuation of timber and timberlands for tax purposes.

\[ [1983 c 3 § 228](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c3.pdf?cite=1983%20c%203%20§%20228); [1963 c 249 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1963c249.pdf?cite=1963%20c%20249%20§%201); \]

As used in RCW 84.40.031 through 84.40.033 "timberlands" means land primarily suitable and used for growing a continuous supply of forest products, whether such lands be cutover, selectively harvested, or contain merchantable or immature timber, and includes the timber thereon. Timberlands are lands devoted to reforestation within the meaning of Article VII, section 1 of the state Constitution as amended.

## 84.40.033 - Valuation of timber and timberlands—Legislative findings.
It is hereby found and declared that:

1. Timber constitutes the primary renewable resource of this state.

2. It is the public policy of this state that timberlands be managed in such a way as to assure a continuous supply of forest products.

3. It is in the public interest that forest valuation and taxation policy encourage and permit timberland owners to manage their lands to sustain maximum production of raw materials for the forest industry, to maintain other public benefits, and to maintain a stable and equitable tax base.

4. Forest management entails continuous and accumulative burdens of taxes, protection, management costs, interest on investment, and risks of loss from fire, insects, disease and the elements over long periods of time prior to harvest and realization of income.

5. Existing timberland valuation and taxation procedures under the general property tax system are consistent with the public interest and the public policy herein set forth only when due consideration and recognition is given to all relevant factors in determining the true and fair value in money of each tract or lot of timberland.

6. To assure equality and uniformity of taxation of timberland, uniform principles should be applied for determining the true and fair value in money of such timberlands, taking into account all pertinent factors such as regional differences in species and growing conditions.

7. The true and fair value in money of timberlands must be determined through application of sound valuation principles based upon the highest and best use of such properties. The highest and best use of timberlands, whether cut-over, selectively harvested, or containing merchantable or immature timber, is to manage, protect and harvest them in a manner which will realize the greatest economic value and assure the maximum continuous supply of forest products. This requires that merchantable timber originally on timberlands be harvested gradually to maintain a continuous supply until immature timber reaches the optimum age or size for harvesting, that immature timber on timberlands be managed and protected for extensive periods until it reaches such optimum age or size and that such timberlands be continually restocked as harvested.

8. Reforestation entails an integrated forest management program which includes gradual harvesting of existing merchantable timber, management and protection of immature timber during its growth cycle until it reaches the optimum size or age for harvesting and a continual preparation and restocking of areas after harvest. Such management of timberlands is now generally followed and practiced in this state and it is in the public interest that such management be continued and encouraged.

9. The prices at which merchantable timber is sold generally reflect values based upon immediate harvesting, and the prices at which both merchantable and immature timber are sold frequently reflect circumstances peculiar to the particular purchaser. Such prices generally make little or no allowance for the continuous and accumulative burdens of taxes, protection, management costs, interest on investment, and risks of loss from fire, insects, disease, and the elements which must be borne by the owner of timberlands over long periods of time prior to the time timber is harvested and income is realized. Such prices do not, therefore, provide a reliable measure of the true and fair value in money. Accordingly, both the public policy and the public interest of this state and sound principles of timber valuation require that in the determination of the true and fair value in money of such properties appropriate and full allowance be made for such continuous and accumulative burdens over the period of time between assessment and harvest.

## 84.40.038 - Petition county board of equalization—Limitation on changes to time limit—Waiver of filing deadline—Direct appeal to state board of tax appeals.
1. The owner or person responsible for payment of taxes on any property may petition the county board of equalization for a change in the assessed valuation placed upon such property by the county assessor or for any other reason specifically authorized by statute. Such petition must be made on forms prescribed or approved by the department of revenue and any petition not conforming to those requirements or not properly completed may not be considered by the board. The petition must be filed with the board:

   a. On or before July 1st of the year of the assessment or determination;

   b. Within thirty days after the date the assessment, value change notice, or other notice was mailed;

   c. Within thirty days after the date that the assessor electronically (i) transmitted the assessment, value change notice, or other notice, or (ii) notified the owner or person responsible for payment of taxes that the assessment, value change notice, or other notice was available to be accessed by the owner or other person; or

   d. Within a time limit of up to sixty days adopted by the county legislative authority, whichever is later. If a county legislative authority sets a time limit, the authority may not change the limit for three years from the adoption of the limit.

2. The board of equalization may waive the filing deadline if the petition is filed within a reasonable time after the filing deadline and the petitioner shows good cause for the late filing. However, the board of equalization must waive the filing deadline for the circumstance described under (f) of this subsection if the petition is filed within a reasonable time after the filing deadline. The decision of the board of equalization regarding a waiver of the filing deadline is final and not appealable under RCW 84.08.130. Good cause may be shown by one or more of the following events or circumstances:

   a. Death or serious illness of the taxpayer or his or her immediate family;

   b. The taxpayer was absent from the address where the taxpayer normally receives the assessment or value change notice, was absent for more than fifteen days of the days allowed in subsection (1) of this section before the filing deadline, and the filing deadline is after July 1;

   c. Incorrect written advice regarding filing requirements received from board of equalization staff, county assessor's staff, or staff of the property tax advisor designated under RCW 84.48.140;

   d. Natural disaster such as flood or earthquake;

   e. Delay or loss related to the delivery of the petition by the postal service, and documented by the postal service;

   f. The taxpayer was not sent a revaluation notice under RCW 84.40.045 for the current assessment year and the taxpayer can demonstrate both of the following:

      i. The taxpayer's property value did not change from the previous year; and

      ii. The taxpayer's property is located in an area revalued by the assessor for the current assessment year; or

   g. Other circumstances as the department may provide by rule.

3. The owner or person responsible for payment of taxes on any property may request that the appeal be heard by the state board of tax appeals without a hearing by the county board of equalization when the assessor, the owner or person responsible for payment of taxes on the property, and a majority of the county board of equalization agree that a direct appeal to the state board of tax appeals is appropriate. The state board of tax appeals may reject the appeal, in which case the county board of equalization must consider the appeal under RCW 84.48.010. Notice of such a rejection, together with the reason therefor, must be provided to the affected parties and the county board of equalization within thirty days of receipt of the direct appeal by the state board.

3. A new valuation established under this section may be appealed under RCW 84.40.038.

4. If the assessor reduces the valuation of real property using the process under this section, the property owner shall be entitled to a refund on property taxes paid on this property calculated as follows:

   a. A property owner is entitled to receive a refund for each year after the restriction was adopted, but not to exceed three years, that the taxpayer paid property taxes on the real property based upon the prior higher valuation; and

   b. The amount of the refund in each year shall be the amount of reduced valuation on the real property for that year, multiplied by the rate of property taxes imposed on the property in that year.

5. As used in this section, "restriction" means a limitation, requirement, regulation, or restriction that limits the use of the property, including those imposed by the application of ordinances, resolutions, rules, regulations, policies, statutes, and conditions of land use approval.

The assessor shall make an alphabetical list of the names of all persons in the county liable to assessment of personal property, and require each person to make a correct list and statement of such property according to the standard form prescribed by the department of revenue, which statement and list shall include, if required by the form, the year of acquisition and total original cost of personal property in each category of the prescribed form. However, the assessor may list and value improvements on publicly owned land in the same manner as real property is listed and valued, including conformance with the revaluation program required under chapter 84.41 RCW. Such list and statement shall be filed on or before the last day of April. The assessor shall on or before the 1st day of January of each year mail, or electronically transmit, a notice to all such persons at their last known address that such statement and list is required. This notice must be accompanied by the form on which the statement or list is to be made. The notice mailed, or electronically transmitted, by the assessor to each taxpayer each year shall, if practicable, include the statement and list of personal property of the taxpayer for the preceding year. Upon receipt of such statement and list the assessor shall thereupon determine the true and fair value of the property included in such statement and enter one hundred percent of the same on the assessment roll opposite the name of the party assessed; and in making such entry in the assessment list, the assessor shall give the name and post office address of the party listing the property, and if the party resides in a city the assessor shall give the street and number or other brief description of the party's residence or place of business. The assessor may, after giving written notice of the action to the person to be assessed, add to the assessment list any taxable property which should be included in such list.

## 84.40.175 - Listing of exempt property—Proof of exemption—Valuation of publicly owned property.
At the time of making the assessment of real property, the assessor must enter each description of property exempt under the provisions of chapter 84.36 RCW, and value and list the same in the manner and subject to the same rule as the assessor is required to assess all other property, designating in each case to whom such property belongs. The valuation requirements of this section do not apply to publicly owned property exempt from taxation under provisions of RCW 84.36.010. However, when the exempt status of such property no longer applies as a result of a sale or change in use, the assessor must value and list such property as of the January 1st assessment date for the year of the status change. The owner or person responsible for payment of taxes may thereafter petition the county board of equalization for a change in the assessed value in accordance with the timing and procedures set forth in RCW 84.40.038.
