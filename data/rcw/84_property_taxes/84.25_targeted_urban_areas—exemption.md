## 84.25.010 - Findings.
The legislature finds that:

1. Many cities have planned under the growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW, and designated and zoned lands for industrial and manufacturing use;

2. The industrial and manufacturing industries provide family living wage jobs;

3. In the current economic climate the creation of additional family living wage jobs is essential;

4. It is critical that Washington state promote its continued strength in the fields of aerospace, technology, biomedical, and other industries that will provide family-wage job growth; and

5. Planning for industrial and manufacturing use is inadequate to attract new industry and manufacturing and an incentive should be created to stimulate the development of new industrial and manufacturing uses in the existing inventory of lands zoned for industrial and manufacturing use in targeted urban areas through a tax incentive as provided by this chapter.

\[ [2015 1st sp.s. c 9 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5761.SL.pdf?cite=2015%201st%20sp.s.%20c%209%20§%201); \]

## 84.25.020 - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to encourage new manufacturing and industrial uses on undeveloped or underutilized lands zoned for industrial and manufacturing uses in targeted urban areas, thereby increasing employment opportunities for family living wage jobs. Cities that plan under the growth management act meeting the criteria of this chapter where the governing authority of the affected city has found there is insufficient family living wage jobs for its wage earning population may designate a portion of the city's industrial and manufacturing zoned and undeveloped land to receive an ad valorem tax exemption for the value of new construction of industrial/manufacturing facilities within the designated area.

\[ [2015 1st sp.s. c 9 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5761.SL.pdf?cite=2015%201st%20sp.s.%20c%209%20§%202); \]

4. "Growth management act" means chapter 36.70A RCW.

5. "Industrial/manufacturing facilities" means building improvements that are 10,000 square feet or larger, representing a minimum improvement valuation of $800,000 for uses categorized as "division D: manufacturing" or "division E: transportation (major groups 40-42, 45, or 47-48)" by the United States department of labor in the occupation safety and health administration's standard industrial classification manual, provided, a city may limit the tax exemption to manufacturing uses.

6. "Lands zoned for industrial and manufacturing uses" means lands in a city zoned for an industrial or manufacturing use consistent with the city's comprehensive plan where the lands are designated for industry.

7. "Owner" means the property owner of record.

8. "Targeted area" means an area of undeveloped lands zoned for industrial and manufacturing uses in the city that is located within or contiguous to an innovation partnership zone, foreign trade zone, or EB-5 regional center, and designated for possible exemption under the provisions of this chapter.

## 84.25.110 - Certificate of tax exemption—Requirements.
1. Upon completion of the new construction of a manufacturing/industrial [industrial/manufacturing] facility for which an application for an exemption under this chapter has been approved and issued a certificate of occupancy, the owner must file with the city the following:

   a. A description of the work that has been completed and a statement that the new construction on the owner's property qualify the property for a partial exemption under this chapter;

   b. A statement of the new family living wage jobs to be offered as a result of the new construction of manufacturing/industrial [industrial/manufacturing] facilities; and

   c. A statement that the work has been completed within three years of the issuance of the conditional certificate of tax exemption.

2. Within thirty days after receipt of the statements required under subsection (1) of this section, the city must determine whether the work completed and the jobs to be offered are consistent with the application and the contract approved by the city and whether the application is qualified for a tax exemption under this chapter.

\[ [2015 1st sp.s. c 9 § 12](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5761.SL.pdf?cite=2015%201st%20sp.s.%20c%209%20§%2012); \]

## 84.25.130 - Improvements.
1. If the value of improvements have been exempted under this chapter, the improvements continue to be exempted for the applicable period under this chapter so long as they are not converted to another use and continue to satisfy all applicable conditions including, but not limited to, zoning, land use, building, and family-wage job creation.

2. If an owner voluntarily opts to discontinue compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the owner must notify the assessor within 60 days of the change in use or intended discontinuance.

3. If, after a certificate of tax exemption has been filed with the county assessor, the city discovers that a portion of the property is changed or will be changed to disqualify the owner for exemption eligibility under this chapter, the tax exemption must be canceled and the following occurs:

   a. Additional real property tax must be imposed on the value of the nonqualifying improvements in the amount that would be imposed if an exemption had not been available under this chapter, plus a penalty equal to 20 percent of the additional value. This additional tax is calculated based upon the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if it had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements dated back to the date that the improvements were converted to a nonqualifying use;

   b. The tax must include interest upon the amounts of the additional tax at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes from the dates on which the additional tax could have been paid without penalty if the improvements had been assessed at a value without regard to this chapter; and

   c. The additional tax owed together with interest and penalty becomes a lien on the property and attaches at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from the qualifying use under this chapter or the amenities no longer meet the applicable requirements for exemption under this chapter. A lien under this section has priority to, and must be fully paid and satisfied before, a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the property may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent property taxes.

4. If, after a certificate of tax exemption has been filed with the county assessor, the city discovers that the facility maintains fewer than 25 family living wage jobs, the owner is considered ineligible for the exemption under this chapter, and the following must occur:

   a. The tax exemption must be canceled; and

   b. Additional real property tax must be imposed in the amount that would be imposed if an exemption had not been available under this chapter, dated back to the date that the facility last maintained a minimum of 25 family living wage jobs.

5. Upon a determination that a tax exemption is to be terminated for a reason stated in this section, the city's governing authority must notify the record owner of the property as shown by the tax rolls by mail, return receipt requested, of the determination to terminate the exemption. The owner may appeal the determination to the city, within 30 days by filing a notice of appeal with the city, which notice must specify the factual and legal basis on which the determination of termination is alleged to be erroneous. At an appeal hearing, all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. After the hearing, the deciding body or officer must either affirm, modify, or repeal the decision of termination of exemption based on the evidence received. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the deciding body or officer to the superior court as provided in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.

6. Upon determination by the city to terminate an exemption, the county officials having possession of the assessment and tax rolls must correct the rolls in the manner provided for omitted property under RCW 84.40.080. The county assessor must make such a valuation of the property and improvements as is necessary to permit the correction of the rolls. The value of the new industrial/manufacturing facilities added to the rolls is considered new construction for the purposes of chapter 84.40 RCW. The owner may appeal the valuation to the county board of equalization as provided in chapter 84.40 RCW. If there has been a failure to comply with this chapter, the property must be listed as an omitted assessment for assessment years beginning January 1st of the calendar year in which the noncompliance first occurred, but the listing as an omitted assessment may not be for a period more than three calendar years preceding the year in which the failure to comply was discovered.
