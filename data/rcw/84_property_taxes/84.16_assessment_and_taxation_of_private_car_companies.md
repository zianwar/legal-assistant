## 84.16.040 - Annual assessment—Sources of information.
The department of revenue must annually make an assessment of the operating property of each private car company. Between the first day of May and the first day of July of each year the department must prepare an initial assessment roll upon which the department must enter and assess the true and fair value of all the operating property of each of such companies as of the first day of January of the year in which the assessment is made. The department must finalize the assessment roll by the twentieth day of August of each year. For the purpose of determining the true and fair value of such property the department of revenue may take into consideration any information or knowledge obtained by the department from an examination and inspection of such property, or of the books, records, and accounts of such companies, the statements filed as required by this chapter, the reports, statements, or returns of such companies filed in the office of any board, office, or commission of this state or any county thereof, the earnings and earning power of such companies, the franchises owned or used by such companies, the true and fair valuation of any and all property of such companies, whether operating property or nonoperating property, and whether situated within or without the state, and any other facts, evidences, or information that may be obtainable bearing upon the value of the operating property. However, in no event may any statement or report required from any company by this chapter be conclusive upon the department of revenue in determining the amount, character, and true and fair value of the operating property of such company.

## 84.16.050 - Basis of valuation—Apportionment of system value to state.
The department of revenue may, in determining the true and fair value of the operating property to be placed on the assessment roll value the entire property as a unit. If the company owns, leases, operates or uses property partly within and partly without the state, the department of revenue may determine the value of the operating property within this state by the proportion that the value of such property bears to the value of the entire operating property of the company, both within and without this state. In determining the operating property which is located within this state the department of revenue may consider and base such determination on the proportion which the number of car miles of the various classes of cars made in this state bears to the total number of car miles made by the same cars within and without this state, or to the total number of car miles made by all cars of the various classes within and without this state. If the value of the operating property of the company cannot be fairly determined in such manner the department of revenue may use any other reasonable and fair method to determine the value of the operating property of the company within this state.

## 84.16.090 - Assessment roll—Notice of valuation.
Upon the assessment roll must be placed after the name of each company a general description of the operating property of the company, which is considered sufficient if described in the language of RCW 84.16.010(3) or otherwise, following which must be entered the true and fair value of the operating property as determined by the department of revenue. No assessment is invalid by a mistake in the name of the company assessed, by omission of the name of the owner or by the entry of a name other than that of the true owner. When the department of revenue has prepared the initial assessment roll and entered thereon the true and fair value of the operating property of the company, as required, the department must notify the company by mail of the valuation determined by it and entered upon the roll; and thereupon such valuation must become the true and fair value of the operating property of the company, subject to revision or correction by the department of revenue as hereinafter provided; and must be the valuation upon which, after equalization by the department of revenue as hereinafter provided, the taxes of such company are based and computed.

If the operating property of any company is situated or located within, extends into or is operated into or through more than one county, the value thereof shall be apportioned to the respective counties into or through which its cars are operated in the proportion that the length of main line track of the respective railroads moving such cars in such counties bears to the total length of main line track of such respective railroads in this state.

3. If the property of any company is of such character that it will not be reasonable, feasible or fair to apportion the value as hereinabove provided, the value thereof shall be apportioned between the respective counties into or through which such property extends or is operated or in which the same is located in such manner as may be reasonable, feasible and fair.
