## 58.28.110 - Deficiency assessment—When payable.

\[ [1909 c 231 § 11](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c231.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20231%20§%2011); RRS § 11495; 1888 c 124 pp 216-220; \]

No conveyance of any such lands made as in this chapter provided, concludes the rights of third persons; but such third persons may have their action in the premises, to determine their alleged interest in such lands and their right to the legal title thereto against such grantee, his, her, its or their heirs, successors or assigns, to which they may deem themselves entitled either in law or equity; but no action for the recovery or possession of such premises, or any portion thereof, or to establish the right to the legal title thereto, must be maintained in any court against the grantee named therein, or against his, her, its or their legal representatives or assigns, unless such action shall be commenced within six months after such deed shall have been filed for record in the office of the county auditor of the county where such lands are situate; nothing herein shall be construed to extend the time of limitation prescribed by law for the commencement of actions upon the possessory claim or title to real estate, when such action is barred by law at the time of the passage of this chapter.

\[ [1909 c 231 § 12](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c231.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20231%20§%2012); RRS § 11496; 1888 c 124 pp 216-220; \]

## 58.28.130 - Entries on mineral lands—Rights of claimants.
Townsite entries may be made by incorporated towns or cities on the mineral lands of the United States, but no title shall be acquired by such towns or cities to any vein of gold, silver, cinnabar, copper or lead, or to any valid mining claim or possession held under existing law. When mineral veins are possessed within the limits of an incorporated town or city, and such possession is recognized by local authority or by the laws of the United States, the title to town lots shall be subject to such recognized possession and the necessary use thereof and when entry has been made or patent issued for such townsites to such incorporated town or city, the possessor of such mineral vein may enter and receive patent for such mineral vein, and the surface ground appertaining thereto: PROVIDED, That no entry shall be made by such mineral vein claimant for surface ground where the owner or occupier of the surface ground shall have had possession of the same before the inception of the title of the mineral vein applicant.

\[ [1909 c 231 § 13](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1909c231.pdf?cite=1909%20c%20231%20§%2013); RRS § 11497; 1888 c 124 pp 216-220; \]

## 58.28.140 - Conflicting claims—Procedure.
In all cases of adverse claims or disputes arising out of conflicting claims to lands or concerning boundary lines, the adverse claimants may submit the decision thereof to the council of such city or town by an agreement in writing specifying particularly the subject matter in dispute, and may agree that their decision shall be final. The council must hear the proofs, and shall order a deed to be executed or denied in accordance with the facts; but in all other cases of adverse claims, the party out of possession shall commence his or her action in a court of competent jurisdiction within six months after the time of filing of the patent from the United States (or a certified copy thereof), in the office of the county auditor. In case such action be commenced, the plaintiff must serve a notice of lis pendens upon the mayor, who must thereupon stay all proceedings in the matter of granting any deed to the land in dispute until the final decision in such suit; and upon presentation of a certified copy of the final judgment of such court in such action, the council must cause to be executed and delivered a deed of such premises, in accordance with the judgment, adjudging the claimant to have been an occupant of any particular lot or lots at the time of the entry of such townsite in the United States land office, or to be the successor in interest of such occupant. If in any action brought under this chapter, or under said acts of congress, the right to the ground in controversy shall not be established by either party, the court or jury shall so find and judgment shall be entered accordingly. In such case costs shall not be allowed to either party, and neither party shall be entitled to a deed to the ground in controversy, and in such action it shall be incumbent upon each claimant to establish that he, she, or it was an occupant of the ground in controversy within the meaning of the said acts of congress at the time of the entry of said townsite in the United States land office, or is the successor in interest of such occupant.
