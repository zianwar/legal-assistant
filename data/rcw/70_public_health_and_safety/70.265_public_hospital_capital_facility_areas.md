## 70.265.010 - Finding.
The legislature finds that it is in the interests of the people of the state of Washington to be able to establish public hospital capital facility areas as quasi-municipal corporations and independent taxing units existing within the boundaries of counties composed entirely of islands that receive medical services from an existing public hospital district but are not annexed to an existing public hospital district for the purpose of financing the construction, additions, or betterments of capital hospital facilities or other capital health care facilities.

\[ [2009 c 481 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5354.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20481%20§%201); \]

## 70.265.020 - Definitions.
1. "Hospital capital facilities" include both real and personal property including land, buildings, site improvements, equipment, furnishings, collections, and all necessary costs related to acquisition, financing, design, construction, equipping, and remodeling.

2. "Other capital health care facilities" means nursing home, extended care, long-term care, outpatient and rehabilitative facilities, ambulances, and such other facilities as are appropriate to the health needs of the population served.

3. "Public hospital capital facility area" means a quasi-municipal corporation and independent taxing authority within the meaning of Article VII, section 1 of the state Constitution, and a taxing district within the meaning of Article VII, section 2 of the state Constitution, created by a county legislative authority of a county composed entirely of islands that receives medical services from a hospital district, but is prevented by geography and the absence of contiguous boundaries from annexing to that district. A public hospital capital facility area may include all or a portion of a city or town.

   a. Upon receipt of a completed petition to both establish a public hospital capital facility area and submit a ballot proposition under RCW 70.265.070 to finance public hospital capital facilities and other capital health care facilities, the legislative authority of the county in which a proposed public hospital capital facility area is to be established shall submit separate ballot propositions to voters to authorize establishing the proposed public hospital capital facility area and authorizing the public hospital capital facility area, if established, to finance public hospital capital facilities or other capital health care facilities by issuing general indebtedness and imposing excess levies to retire the indebtedness. A petition submitted under this section must be accompanied by a written request to establish a public hospital capital facility area that is signed by a majority of the commissioners of the public hospital district serving the proposed area.

   b. The ballot propositions must be submitted to voters of the proposed public hospital capital facility area at a general or special election. If the proposed election date is not a general election, the county legislative authority is encouraged to request an election when another unit of local government with territory located in the proposed public hospital capital facility area is already holding a special election under RCW 29A.04.330. Approval of the ballot proposition to create a public hospital capital facility area requires a simple majority vote by the voters participating in the election.

2. A completed petition submitted under this section must include:

   a. A description of the boundaries of the public hospital capital facility area; and

   b. A copy of a resolution of the legislative authority of each city, town, and hospital district with territory in the proposed public hospital capital facility area indicating both: (i) Approval of the creation of the proposed public hospital capital facility area; and (ii) agreement on how election costs will be paid for ballot propositions to voters that authorize the public hospital capital facility area to incur general indebtedness and impose excess levies to retire the general indebtedness.
