It is declared to be the policy of the legislature of the state of Washington that, wherever feasible, community health services and services for persons with mental illness or intellectual disabilities shall be combined within single facilities in order to provide maximum utilization of available funds and personnel, and to assure the greatest possible coordination of such services for the benefit of those requiring them. It is further declared to be the policy of the legislature to authorize the state to cooperate with counties, cities, and other municipal corporations in order to encourage them to take such steps as may be necessary to construct comprehensive community health centers in communities throughout the state.
