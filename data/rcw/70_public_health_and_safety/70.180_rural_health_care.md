## 70.180.005 - Finding—Health care professionals.
The legislature finds that a health care access problem exists in rural areas of the state because rural health care providers are unable to leave the community for short-term periods of time to attend required continuing education training or for personal matters because their absence would leave the community without adequate medical care coverage. The lack of adequate medical coverage in geographically remote rural communities constitutes a threat to the health and safety of the people in those communities.

The legislature declares that it is in the public interest to recruit and maintain a pool of physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, and advanced registered nurse practitioners willing and able on short notice to practice in rural communities on a short-term basis to meet the medical needs of the community.

\[ [1991 c 332 § 27](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1960-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20332%20§%2027); [1990 c 271 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c271.pdf?cite=1990%20c%20271%20§%201); \]

## 70.180.009 - Finding—Rural training opportunities.
The legislature finds that a shortage of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physician assistants exists in rural areas of the state. In addition, many education programs to train these health care providers do not include options for practical training experience in rural settings. As a result, many health care providers find their current training does not prepare them for the unique demands of rural practice.

The legislature declares that the availability of rural training opportunities as a part of professional medical, nursing, pharmacist, and physician assistant education would provide needed practical experience, serve to attract providers to rural areas, and help address the current shortage of these providers in rural Washington.

\[ [1990 c 271 § 14](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c271.pdf?cite=1990%20c%20271%20§%2014); \]

## 70.180.011 - Definitions.
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Department" means the department of health.

2. "Rural areas" means a rural area in the state of Washington as identified by the department.

\[ [1991 c 332 § 29](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1960-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20332%20§%2029); \]

## 70.180.020 - Health professional temporary substitute resource pool.
The department shall establish or contract for a health professional temporary substitute resource pool. The purpose of the pool is to provide short-term physician, physician assistant, pharmacist, and advanced registered nurse practitioner personnel to rural communities where these health care providers:

1. Are unavailable due to provider shortages;

2. Need time off from practice to attend continuing education and other training programs; and

3. Need time off from practice to attend to personal matters or recover from illness.

The health professional temporary substitute resource pool is intended to provide short-term assistance and should complement active health provider recruitment efforts by rural communities where shortages exist.

\[ [1994 c 103 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2508.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%20103%20§%201); [1990 c 271 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c271.pdf?cite=1990%20c%20271%20§%202); \]

## 70.180.030 - Registry of health care professionals available to rural communities—Conditions of participation.
1. The department, in cooperation with the University of Washington school of medicine, the state's registered nursing programs, the state's pharmacy programs, and other appropriate public and private agencies and associations, shall develop and keep current a register of physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, and advanced registered nurse practitioners who are available to practice on a short-term basis in rural communities of the state. The department shall list only individuals who have a valid license to practice.

   b. Receive reimbursement for the cost of malpractice insurance if the services provided are not covered by the substitute provider's or local provider's existing medical malpractice insurance. Reimbursement for malpractice insurance shall only be made available to sites that incur additional costs for substitute provider coverage.

4. The department may require rural communities to participate in health professional recruitment programs as a condition for providing a temporary substitute health care professional if the community does not have adequate permanent health care personnel. To the extent deemed appropriate and subject to funding, the department may also require communities to participate in other programs or projects, such as the rural health system project authorized in chapter 70.175 RCW, that are designed to assist communities to reorganize the delivery of rural health care services.

5. A participating site may receive reimbursement for substitute provider assistance as provided for in subsection (3) of this section for up to ninety days during any twelve-month period. The department may modify or waive this limitation should it determine that the health and safety of the community warrants a waiver or modification.

6. Participating sites shall:

   a. Be responsible for all salary expenses for the temporary substitute provider.

   b. Provide the temporary substitute provider with referral and backup coverage information.

## 70.180.120 - Midwifery—Statewide plan.
The department, in consultation with training programs that lead to licensure in midwifery and certification as a certified nurse midwife, and other appropriate private and public groups, shall develop a statewide plan to address access to midwifery services.

The plan shall include at least the following: (1) Identification of maternity service shortage areas in the state where midwives could reduce the shortage of services; (2) an inventory of current training programs and preceptorship activities available to train licensed and certified nurse midwives; (3) identification of gaps in the availability of training due to such factors as geographic or economic conditions that prevent individuals from seeking training; (4) identification of other barriers to utilizing midwives; (5) identification of strategies to train future midwives such as developing training programs at community colleges and universities, using innovative telecommunications for training in rural areas, and establishing preceptorship programs accessible to prospective midwives in shortage areas; (6) development of recruitment strategies; and (7) estimates of expected costs associated in recruitment and training.

The plan shall identify the most expeditious and cost-efficient manner to recruit and train midwives to meet the current shortages.
