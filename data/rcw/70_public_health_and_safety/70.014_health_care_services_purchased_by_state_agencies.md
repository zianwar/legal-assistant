In each case where feasible in which an alternative health care provider arrangement, of similar scope and quality, is available at lower cost than fee-for-service providers, such state agencies shall make the services of the alternative provider available to clients, consumers, or employees for whom state dollars are spent to purchase health care. As consistent with other state and federal law, requirements for copayments, deductibles, the scope of available services, or other incentives shall be used to encourage clients, consumers, or employees to use the lowest cost providers, except that copayments or deductibles shall not be required where they might have the impact of denying access to necessary health care in a timely manner.
