## 70.02.005 - Findings.
The legislature finds that:

1. Health care information is personal and sensitive information that if improperly used or released may do significant harm to a patient's interests in privacy, health care, or other interests.

2. Patients need access to their own health care information as a matter of fairness to enable them to make informed decisions about their health care and correct inaccurate or incomplete information about themselves.

3. In order to retain the full trust and confidence of patients, health care providers have an interest in assuring that health care information is not improperly disclosed and in having clear and certain rules for the disclosure of health care information.

4. Persons other than health care providers obtain, use, and disclose health record information in many different contexts and for many different purposes. It is the public policy of this state that a patient's interest in the proper use and disclosure of the patient's health care information survives even when the information is held by persons other than health care providers.

5. The movement of patients and their health care information across state lines, access to and exchange of health care information from automated data banks, and the emergence of multistate health care providers creates a compelling need for uniform law, rules, and procedures governing the use and disclosure of health care information.

## 70.02.265 - Adolescent behavioral health services—Disclosure of treatment information and records—Restrictions and requirements—Immunity from liability.
1. [Empty]

   a. When an adolescent voluntarily consents to his or her own mental health treatment under RCW 71.34.500 or 71.34.530, a mental health professional shall not proactively exercise his or her discretion under RCW 70.02.240 to release information or records related to solely mental health services received by the adolescent to a parent of the adolescent, beyond any notification required under RCW 71.34.510, unless the adolescent states a clear desire to do so which is documented by the mental health professional, except in situations concerning an imminent threat to the health and safety of the adolescent or others, or as otherwise may be required by law.

   b. In the event a mental health professional discloses information or releases records, or both, that relate solely to mental health services of an adolescent, to a parent pursuant to RCW 70.02.240(3), the mental health professional must provide notice of this disclosure to the adolescent and the adolescent must have a reasonable opportunity to express any concerns about this disclosure to the mental health professional prior to the disclosure of the information or records related solely to mental health services. The mental health professional shall document any objections to disclosure in the adolescent's medical record if the mental health professional subsequently discloses information or records related solely to mental health services over the objection of the adolescent.

2. When an adolescent receives a mental health evaluation or treatment at the direction of a parent under RCW 71.34.600 through 71.34.670, the mental health professional is encouraged to exercise his or her discretion under RCW 70.02.240 to proactively release to the parent such information and records related to solely mental health services received by the adolescent, excluding psychotherapy notes, that are necessary to assist the parent in understanding the nature of the evaluation or treatment and in supporting their child. Such information includes:

   a. Diagnosis;

   b. Treatment plan and progress in treatment;

   c. Recommended medications, including risks, benefits, side effects, typical efficacy, dose, and schedule;

   d. Psychoeducation about the child's mental health;

   e. Referrals to community resources;

   f. Coaching on parenting or behavioral management strategies; and

   g. Crisis prevention planning and safety planning.

3. If, after receiving a request from a parent for release of mental health treatment information relating to an adolescent, the mental health professional determines that disclosure of information or records related solely to mental health services pursuant to RCW 70.02.240(3) would be detrimental to the adolescent and declines to disclose such information or records, the mental health professional shall document the reasons for the lack of disclosure in the adolescent's medical record.

4. Information or records about an adolescent's substance use disorder evaluation or treatment may be provided to a parent without the written consent of the adolescent only if permitted by federal law. A mental health professional or chemical dependency professional providing substance use disorder evaluation or treatment to an adolescent may seek the written consent of the adolescent to provide substance use disorder treatment information or records to a parent when the mental health professional or chemical dependency professional determines that both seeking the written consent and sharing the substance use disorder treatment information or records of the adolescent would not be detrimental to the adolescent.

5. A mental health professional providing inpatient or outpatient mental health evaluation or treatment is not civilly liable for the decision to disclose information or records related to solely mental health services or not disclose such information or records so long as the decision was reached in good faith and without gross negligence.

6. A chemical dependency professional or mental health professional providing inpatient or outpatient substance use disorder evaluation or treatment is not civilly liable for the decision to disclose information or records related to substance use disorder treatment information with the written consent of the adolescent or to not disclose such information or records to a parent without an adolescent's consent pursuant to this section so long as the decision was reached in good faith and without gross negligence.

7. For purposes of this section, "adolescent" means a minor thirteen years of age or older.
