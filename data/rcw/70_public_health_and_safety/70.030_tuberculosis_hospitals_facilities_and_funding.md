## 70.30.045 - Expenditures for tuberculosis control directed—Standards—Payment for treatment.
Tuberculosis is a communicable disease and tuberculosis prevention, treatment, control, and follow-up of known cases of tuberculosis are the basic steps in the control of this major health problem. In order to carry on such work effectively in accordance with the standards set by the secretary under RCW 70.28.025, the legislative authority of each county shall budget a sum to be used for the control of tuberculosis, including case finding, prevention, treatment, and follow-up of known cases of tuberculosis. Under no circumstances should this section be construed to mean that the legislative authority of each county shall budget sums to provide tuberculosis treatment when the patient has the ability to pay for the treatment. Each patient's ability to pay for the treatment shall be assessed by the local health department.

In order to maintain adequate facilities and services for the residents of the state of Washington who are or may be suffering from tuberculosis and to assure their proper care, the legislative authority of each county shall budget annually a sum to provide such services in the county.
