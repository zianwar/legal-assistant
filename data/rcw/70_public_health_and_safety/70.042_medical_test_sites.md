## 70.42.005 - Intent—Construction.
The legislature intends that medical test sites meet criteria known to promote accurate and reliable analysis, thus improving health care through uniform test site licensure and regulation including quality control, quality assurance, and proficiency testing. The legislature also intends to meet the requirements of federal laws licensing and regulating medical testing.

The legislature intends that nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to place any liability whatsoever on the state for the action or inaction of test sites or test site personnel. The legislature further intends that nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to expand the state's role regarding medical testing beyond the provisions of this chapter.
