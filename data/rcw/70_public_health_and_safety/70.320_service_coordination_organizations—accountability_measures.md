## 70.320.010 - Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Authority" means the health care authority.

2. "Department" means the department of social and health services.

3. "Emerging best practice" or "promising practice" means a program or practice that, based on statistical analyses or a well-established theory of change, shows potential for meeting the evidence-based or research-based criteria, which may include the use of a program that is evidence-based for outcomes other than those listed in this section.

4. "Evidence-based" means a program or practice that has been tested in heterogeneous or intended populations with multiple randomized, or statistically controlled evaluations, or both; or one large multiple site randomized, or statistically controlled evaluation, or both, where the weight of the evidence from a systemic review demonstrates sustained improvements in at least one outcome. "Evidence-based" also means a program or practice that can be implemented with a set of procedures to allow successful replication in Washington and, when possible, is determined to be cost-beneficial.

5. "Research-based" means a program or practice that has been tested with a single randomized, or statistically controlled evaluation, or both, demonstrating sustained desirable outcomes; or where the weight of the evidence from a systemic review supports sustained outcomes as described in this subsection but does not meet the full criteria for evidence-based.

6. "Service coordination organization" or "service contracting entity" means the authority and department, or an entity that may contract with the state to provide, directly or through subcontracts, a comprehensive delivery system of medical, behavioral, long-term care, or social support services, including entities such as managed care organizations that provide medical services to clients under chapter 74.09 RCW and RCW 71.24.380, and area agencies on aging providing case management services under chapter 74.39A RCW.

## 70.320.020 - Contract performance measures developed under RCW  70.320.030 based on outcomes—Integration.
1. The authority and the department shall base contract performance measures developed under RCW 70.320.030 on the following outcomes when contracting with service contracting entities: Improvements in client health status and wellness; increases in client participation in meaningful activities; reductions in client involvement with criminal justice systems; reductions in avoidable costs in hospitals, emergency rooms, crisis services, and jails and prisons; increases in stable housing in the community; improvements in client satisfaction with quality of life; and reductions in population-level health disparities.

2. The performance measures must demonstrate the manner in which the following principles are achieved within each of the outcomes under subsection (1) of this section:

   a. Maximization of the use of evidence-based practices will be given priority over the use of research-based and promising practices, and research-based practices will be given priority over the use of promising practices. The agencies will develop strategies to identify programs that are effective with ethnically diverse clients and to consult with tribal governments, experts within ethnically diverse communities and community organizations that serve diverse communities;

   b. The maximization of the client's independence, recovery, and employment;

   c. The maximization of the client's participation in treatment decisions; and

   d. The collaboration between consumer-based support programs in providing services to the client.

3. In developing performance measures under RCW 70.320.030, the authority and the department shall consider expected outcomes relevant to the general populations that each agency serves. The authority and the department may adapt the outcomes to account for the unique needs and characteristics of discrete subcategories of populations receiving services, including ethnically diverse communities.

4. The authority and the department shall coordinate the establishment of the expected outcomes and the performance measures between each agency as well as each program to identify expected outcomes and performance measures that are common to the clients enrolled in multiple programs and to eliminate conflicting standards among the agencies and programs.

5. [Empty]

   a. The authority and the department shall establish timelines and mechanisms for service contracting entities to report data related to performance measures and outcomes, including phased implementation of public reporting of outcome and performance measures in a form that allows for comparison of performance measures and levels of improvement between geographic regions of Washington.

   b. The authority and the department may not release any public reports of client outcomes unless the data has been deidentified and aggregated in such a way that the identity of individual clients cannot be determined through directly identifiable data or the combination of multiple data elements.

6. [Empty]

   a. The performance measures coordinating committee must establish: (i) A performance measure to be integrated into the statewide common measure set which tracks effective integration practices of behavioral health services in primary care settings; (ii) performance measures which track rates of criminal justice system involvement among medical assistance clients with an identified behavioral health need including, but not limited to, rates of arrest and incarceration; and (iii) performance measures which track rates of homelessness and housing instability among medical assistance clients. The authority must set improvement targets related to these measures.

   b. The performance measures coordinating committee must report to the governor and appropriate committees of the legislature regarding the implementation of this subsection by July 1, 2022.

   c. For purposes of establishing performance measures as specified in (a)(ii) of this subsection, the performance measures coordinating committee shall convene a work group of stakeholders including the authority, medicaid managed care organizations, the department of corrections, and others with expertise in criminal justice and behavioral health. The work group shall review current performance measures that have been adopted in other states or nationally to inform this effort.

   d. For purposes of establishing performance measures as specified in (a)(iii) of this subsection, the performance measures coordinating committee shall convene a work group of stakeholders including the authority, medicaid managed care organizations, and others with expertise in housing for low-income populations and with experience understanding the impacts of homelessness and housing instability on health. The work group shall review current performance measures that have been adopted in other states or nationally from organizations with experience in similar measures to inform this effort.

7. The authority must report to the governor and appropriate committees of the legislature:

   a. By October 1, 2022, regarding options and recommendations for integrating value-based purchasing terms and a performance improvement project into managed health care contracts relating to the criminal justice outcomes specified under subsection (1) of this section;

   b. By July 1, 2024, regarding options and recommendations for integrating value-based purchasing terms and to integrate a collective performance improvement project into managed health care contracts related to increasing stable housing in the community outcomes specified under subsection (1) of this section. The authority shall review the performance measures and information from the work group established in subsection (6)(d) of this section.
