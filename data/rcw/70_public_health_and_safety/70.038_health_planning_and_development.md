## 70.38.015 - Declaration of public policy.
It is declared to be the public policy of this state:

1. That strategic health planning efforts must be supported by appropriately tailored regulatory activities that can effectuate the goals and principles of the statewide health resources strategy developed pursuant to chapter 43.370 RCW. The implementation of the strategy can promote, maintain, and assure the health of all citizens in the state, provide accessible health services, health manpower, health facilities, and other resources while controlling increases in costs, and recognize prevention as a high priority in health programs. Involvement in health planning from both consumers and providers throughout the state should be encouraged;

2. That the certificate of need program is a component of a health planning regulatory process that is consistent with the statewide health resources strategy and public policy goals that are clearly articulated and regularly updated;

3. That the development and maintenance of adequate health care information, statistics and projections of need for health facilities and services is essential to effective health planning and resources development;

4. That the development of nonregulatory approaches to health care cost containment should be considered, including the strengthening of price competition; and

5. That health planning should be concerned with public health and health care financing, access, and quality, recognizing their close interrelationship and emphasizing cost control of health services, including cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis.

## 70.38.105 - Health services and facilities requiring certificate of need—Fees.

4. The following shall be subject to certificate of need review under this chapter:

   a. The construction, development, or other establishment of a new health care facility including, but not limited to, a hospital constructed, developed, or established by a health maintenance organization or by a combination of health maintenance organizations except as provided in subsection (7)(a) of this section;

   b. The sale, purchase, or lease of part or all of any existing hospital as defined in RCW 70.38.025 including, but not limited to, a hospital sold, purchased, or leased by a health maintenance organization or by a combination of health maintenance organizations except as provided in subsection (7)(b) of this section;

If a health care facility ceases to be certified as a critical access hospital under 42 U.S.C. 1395i-4, the hospital may revert back to the type and number of licensed hospital beds as it had when it requested critical access hospital designation;

   f. Any new tertiary health services which are offered in or through a health care facility or rural health care facility licensed under RCW 70.175.100, and which were not offered on a regular basis by, in, or through such health care facility or rural health care facility within the twelve-month period prior to the time such services would be offered;

   g. Any expenditure for the construction, renovation, or alteration of a nursing home or change in nursing home services in excess of the expenditure minimum made in preparation for any undertaking under this subsection (4) of this section and any arrangement or commitment made for financing such undertaking.

## 70.38.220 - Ethnic minorities—Nursing home beds that reflect cultural differences.
1. The legislature recognizes that in this state ethnic minorities currently use nursing home care at a lower rate than the general population. The legislature also recognizes and supports the federal mandate that nursing homes receiving federal funds provide residents with a homelike environment. The legislature finds that certain ethnic minorities have special cultural, language, dietary, and other needs not generally met by existing nursing homes which are intended to serve the general population. Accordingly, the legislature further finds that there is a need to foster the development of nursing homes designed to serve the special cultural, language, dietary, and other needs of ethnic minorities.

2. The department shall establish a separate pool of no more than two hundred fifty beds for nursing homes designed to serve the special needs of ethnic minorities. The pool shall be made up of nursing home beds that become available on or after March 15, 1991, due to:

   a. Loss of license or reduction in licensed bed capacity if the beds are not otherwise obligated for replacement; or

   b. Expiration of a certificate of need.

3. The department shall develop procedures for the fair and efficient award of beds from the special pool. In making its decisions regarding the award of beds from the pool, the department shall consider at least the following:

   a. The relative degree to which the long-term care needs of an ethnic minority are not otherwise being met;

   b. The percentage of low-income persons who would be served by the proposed nursing home;

   c. The financial feasibility of the proposed nursing home; and

   d. The impact of the proposal on the area's total need for nursing home beds.

4. To be eligible to apply for or receive an award of beds from the special pool, an application must be to build a new nursing home, or add beds to a nursing home, that:

   a. Will be owned and operated by a nonprofit corporation, and at least fifty percent of the board of directors of the corporation are members of the ethnic minority the nursing home is intended to serve;

   b. Will be designed, managed, and administered to serve the special cultural, language, dietary, and other needs of an ethnic minority; and

   c. Will not discriminate in admissions against persons who are not members of the ethnic minority whose special needs the nursing home is designed to serve.

5. If a nursing home or portion of a nursing home that is built as a result of an award from the special pool is sold or leased within ten years to a party not eligible under subsection (4) of this section:

   a. The purchaser or lessee may not operate those beds as nursing home beds without first obtaining a certificate of need for new beds under this chapter; and

   b. The beds that had been awarded from the special pool shall be returned to the special pool.

6. The department shall initially award up to one hundred beds before that number of beds are actually in the special pool, provided that the number of beds so awarded are subtracted from the total of two hundred fifty beds that can be awarded from the special pool.

\[ [1991 c 271 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2100-S.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20271%20§%201); \]

## 70.38.230 - Residential hospice care centers—Defined—Change in bed capacity—Applicability of chapter.
1. A change in bed capacity at a residential hospice care center shall not be subject to certificate of need review under this chapter if the department determined prior to June 1994 that the construction, development, or other establishment of the residential hospice care center was not subject to certificate of need review under this chapter.

2. For purposes of this section, a "residential hospice care center" means any building, facility, place, or equivalent that opened in December 1996 and is organized, maintained, and operated specifically to provide beds, accommodations, facilities, and services over a continuous period of twenty-four hours or more for palliative care of two or more individuals, not related to the operator, who are diagnosed as being in the latter stages of an advanced disease that is expected to lead to death.

## 70.38.250 - Redistribution and addition of beds—Determination.
1. The need for projects identified in *RCW 70.38.240 shall be determined using the individual planning area's estimated nursing home bed need ratio and includes but is not limited to the following criteria:

   a. The current capacity of nursing homes and other long-term care services;

   b. The occupancy rates of nursing homes and other long-term care services over the previous two-year period; and

   c. The ability of the other long-term care services to serve all people regardless of payor source.

2. For the purposes of this section, nursing home beds include long-term care units or distinct part long-term care units located in a hospital that is licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW.
