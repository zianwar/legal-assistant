## 70.127.005 - Legislative intent.
The legislature finds that the availability of home health, hospice, and home care services has improved the quality of life for Washington's citizens. However, the delivery of these services bring risks because the in-home location of services makes their actual delivery virtually invisible. Also, the complexity of products, services, and delivery systems in today's health care delivery system challenges even informed and healthy individuals. The fact that these services are delivered to the state's most vulnerable population, the ill or disabled who are frequently also elderly, adds to these risks.

It is the intent of the legislature to protect the citizens of Washington state by licensing home health, hospice, and home care agencies. This legislation is not intended to unreasonably restrict entry into the in-home service marketplace. Standards established are intended to be the minimum necessary to ensure safe and competent care, and should be demonstrably related to patient safety and welfare.

2. The injunction shall not relieve the person operating an in-home services agency without a license from criminal prosecution, or the imposition of a civil fine under RCW 70.127.213(2), but the remedy by injunction shall be in addition to any criminal liability or civil fine. A person that violates an injunction issued under this chapter shall pay a civil penalty, as determined by the court, of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars, which shall be deposited in the department's local fee account. For the purpose of this section, the superior court issuing any injunction shall retain jurisdiction and the cause shall be continued, and in such cases the attorney general acting in the name of the state may petition for the recovery of civil penalties. All fines, forfeitures, and penalties collected or assessed by a court because of a violation of RCW 70.127.020 shall be deposited in the department's local fee account.

## 70.127.213 - Unlicensed operation of an in-home services agency—Cease and desist orders—Adjudicative proceedings—Fines.
1. The department may issue a notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order to any person whom the department has reason to believe is engaged in the unlicensed operation of an in-home services agency. The person to whom the notice of intent is issued may request an adjudicative proceeding to contest the charges. The request for hearing must be filed within twenty days after service of the notice of intent to issue a cease and desist order. The failure to request a hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the department may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine. All proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

2. If the department makes a final determination that a person has engaged or is engaging in unlicensed operation of an in-home services agency, the department may issue a cease and desist order. In addition, the department may impose a civil fine in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars for each day upon which the person engaged in unlicensed operation of an in-home services agency. The proceeds of such fines shall be deposited in the department's local fee account.

3. If the department makes a written finding of fact that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order, the department may issue a temporary cease and desist order. The person receiving a temporary cease and desist order shall be provided an opportunity for a prompt hearing. The temporary cease and desist order shall remain in effect until further order of the department. The failure to request a prompt or regularly scheduled hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the department may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine.

4. Neither the issuance of a cease and desist order nor payment of a civil fine shall relieve the person so operating an in-home services agency without a license from criminal prosecution, but the remedy of a cease and desist order or civil fine shall be in addition to any criminal liability. The cease and desist order is conclusive proof of unlicensed operation and may be enforced under RCW 7.21.060. This method of enforcement of the cease and desist order or civil fine may be used in addition to, or as an alternative to, any provisions for enforcement of agency orders set out in chapter 34.05 RCW.

## 70.127.216 - Unlicensed operation of an in-home services agency—Consumer protection act.
The legislature finds that the operation of an in-home services agency without a license in violation of this chapter is a matter vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Operation of an in-home services agency without a license in violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business. Such a violation is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

\[ [2000 c 175 § 20](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2510.SL.pdf?cite=2000%20c%20175%20§%2020); \]
