## 70.45.010 - Legislative findings.
The health of the people of our state is a most important public concern. The state has an interest in assuring the continued existence of accessible, affordable health care facilities that are responsive to the needs of the communities in which they exist. The state also has a responsibility to protect the public interest in nonprofit hospitals and to clarify the responsibilities of local public hospital district boards with respect to public hospital district assets by making certain that the charitable and public assets of those hospitals are managed prudently and safeguarded consistent with their mission under the laws governing nonprofit and municipal corporations.
