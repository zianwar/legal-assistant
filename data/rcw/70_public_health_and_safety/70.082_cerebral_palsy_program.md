Such program shall extend to developing, extending and improving service for the discovery of such persons and for diagnostication and hospitalization and shall include cooperation with other agencies of the state charged with the administration of laws providing for any type of service or aid to persons with disabilities, and with the United States government through any appropriate agency or instrumentality in developing, extending and improving such service, program and facilities. Such facilities shall include field clinics, diagnosis and observation centers, boarding schools, special classes in day schools, research facilities and such other facilities as shall be required to render appropriate aid to such persons.
