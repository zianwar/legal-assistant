## 71A.10.010 - Legislative finding—Intent—1988 c 176.
The legislature finds that the statutory authority for the programs, policies, and services of the department of social and health services for persons with developmental disabilities often lack[s] clarity and contain[s] internal inconsistencies. In addition, existing authority is in several chapters of the code and frequently contains obsolete language not reflecting current use. The legislature declares that it is in the public interest to unify and update statutes for programs, policies, and services provided to persons with developmental disabilities.

The legislature intends to recodify the authority for the programs, policies, and services for persons with developmental disabilities. This recodification is not intended to affect existing programs, policies, and services, nor to establish any new program, policies, or services not otherwise authorized before June 9, 1988. The legislature intends to provide only those services authorized under state law before June 9, 1988, and only to the extent funds are provided by the legislature.

\[ [1988 c 176 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c176.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20176%20§%201); \]

## 71A.10.011 - Intent—1995 c 383.
The legislature recognizes that the emphasis of state developmental disability services is shifting from institutional-based care to community services in an effort to increase the personal and social independence and fulfillment of persons with developmental disabilities, consistent with state policy as expressed in RCW 71A.10.015. It is the intent of the legislature that financial savings achieved from program reductions and efficiencies within the developmental disabilities program shall be redirected within the program to provide public or private community-based services for eligible persons who would otherwise be unidentified or unserved.

\[ [1995 c 383 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5800-S.SL.pdf?cite=1995%20c%20383%20§%201); \]

## 71A.10.015 - Declaration of policy.
The legislature recognizes the capacity of all persons, including those with developmental disabilities, to be personally and socially productive. The legislature further recognizes the state's obligation to provide aid to persons with developmental disabilities through a uniform, coordinated system of services to enable them to achieve a greater measure of independence and fulfillment and to enjoy all rights and privileges under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the state of Washington.
