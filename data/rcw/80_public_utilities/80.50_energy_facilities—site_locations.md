## 80.50.010 - Legislative finding—Policy—Intent.
The legislature finds that the present and predicted growth in energy demands in the state of Washington requires a procedure for the selection and use of sites for energy facilities and the identification of a state position with respect to each proposed site. The legislature recognizes that the selection of sites will have a significant impact upon the welfare of the population, the location and growth of industry and the use of the natural resources of the state.

It is the policy of the state of Washington to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by recognizing the need for clean energy in order to strengthen the state's economy, meet the state's greenhouse gas reduction obligations, and mitigate the significant near-term and long-term impacts from climate change while conducting a public process that is transparent and inclusive to all with particular attention to overburdened communities.

The legislature finds that the in-state manufacture of industrial products that enable a clean energy economy is critical to advancing the state's objectives in providing affordable electricity, promoting renewable energy, strengthening the state's economy, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide the council with additional authority regarding the siting of clean energy product manufacturing facilities.

It is the policy of the state of Washington to recognize the pressing need for increased energy facilities, and to ensure through available and reasonable methods that the location and operation of all energy facilities and certain clean energy product manufacturing facilities will produce minimal adverse effects on the environment, ecology of the land and its wildlife, and the ecology of state waters and their aquatic life.

It is the intent to seek courses of action that will balance the increasing demands for energy facility location and operation in conjunction with the broad interests of the public. In addition, it is the intent of the legislature to streamline application review for energy facilities to meet the state's energy goals and to authorize applications for review of certain clean energy product manufacturing facilities to be considered under the provisions of this chapter.

Such action will be based on these premises:

1. To assure Washington state citizens that, where applicable, operational safeguards are at least as stringent as the criteria established by the federal government and are technically sufficient for their welfare and protection.

2. To preserve and protect the quality of the environment; to enhance the public's opportunity to enjoy the esthetic and recreational benefits of the air, water and land resources; to promote air cleanliness; to pursue beneficial changes in the environment; and to promote environmental justice for overburdened communities.

3. To encourage the development and integration of clean energy sources.

4. To provide abundant clean energy at reasonable cost.

5. To avoid costs of complete site restoration and demolition of improvements and infrastructure at unfinished nuclear energy sites, and to use unfinished nuclear energy facilities for public uses, including economic development, under the regulatory and management control of local governments and port districts.

6. To avoid costly duplication in the siting process and ensure that decisions are made timely and without unnecessary delay while also encouraging meaningful public comment and participation in energy facility decisions.

## 80.50.300 - Unfinished nuclear power projects—Transfer of all or a portion of a site to a political subdivision or subdivisions of the state—Water rights.
1. This section applies only to unfinished nuclear power projects. If a certificate holder stops construction of a nuclear energy facility before completion, terminates the project or otherwise resolves not to complete construction, never introduces or stores fuel for the energy facility on the site, and never operates the energy facility as designed to produce energy, the certificate holder may contract, establish interlocal agreements, or use other formal means to effect the transfer of site restoration responsibilities, which may include economic development activities, to any political subdivision or subdivisions of the state composed of elected officials. The contracts, interlocal agreements, or other formal means of cooperation may include, but are not limited to provisions effecting the transfer or conveyance of interests in the site and energy facilities from the certificate holder to other political subdivisions of the state, including costs of maintenance and security, capital improvements, and demolition and salvage of the unused energy facilities and infrastructure.

2. If a certificate holder transfers all or a portion of the site to a political subdivision or subdivisions of the state composed of elected officials and located in the same county as the site, the council shall amend the site certification agreement to release those portions of the site that it finds are no longer intended for the development of an energy facility.

Immediately upon release of all or a portion of the site pursuant to this section, all responsibilities for maintaining the public welfare for portions of the site transferred, including but not limited to health and safety, are transferred to the political subdivision or subdivisions of the state. For sites located on federal land, all responsibilities for maintaining the public welfare for all of the site, including but not limited to health and safety, must be transferred to the political subdivision or subdivisions of the state irrespective of whether all or a portion of the site is released.

3. The legislature finds that for all or a portion of sites that have been transferred to a political subdivision or subdivisions of the state prior to September 1, 1999, ensuring water for site restoration including economic development, completed pursuant to this section can best be accomplished by a transfer of existing surface water rights, and that such a transfer is best accomplished administratively through procedures set forth in existing statutes and rules. However, if a transfer of water rights is not possible, the department of ecology shall, within six months of the transfer of the site or portion thereof pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, create a trust water right under chapter 90.42 RCW containing between ten and twenty cubic feet per second for the benefit of the appropriate political subdivision or subdivisions of the state. The trust water right shall be used in fulfilling site restoration responsibilities, including economic development. The trust water right shall be from existing valid water rights within the basin where the site is located.

4. For purposes of this section, "political subdivision or subdivisions of the state" means a city, town, county, public utility district, port district, or joint operating agency.
