## 3.50.005 - Legislative finding—Alternative court structure for cities and towns of four hundred thousand or less.
The legislature finds that there is a multitude of statutes governing the municipal courts of the state. This situation is confusing and misleading to attorneys, judges, court personnel, and others who work with the municipal courts. The legislature therefore finds that a reorganization of the municipal courts of the state would allow those courts to operate in a more effective and efficient manner. This chapter provides a court structure which may be used by cities and towns with a population of four hundred thousand or less which choose to operate under this chapter.

\[ [1984 c 258 § 101](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c258.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20258%20§%20101); \]

## 3.50.010 - Municipal court authorized in cities of four hundred thousand or less.
Any city or town with a population of four hundred thousand or less may by ordinance provide for an inferior court to be known and designated as a municipal court, which shall be entitled "The Municipal Court of . . . . . . . . . (insert name of city or town)", hereinafter designated and referred to as "municipal court", which court shall have jurisdiction and shall exercise all powers by this chapter declared to be vested in the municipal court, together with such other powers and jurisdiction as are generally conferred upon such court in this state either by common law or by express statute.

\[ [1984 c 258 § 103](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c258.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20258%20§%20103); [1961 c 299 § 50](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1961c299.pdf?cite=1961%20c%20299%20§%2050); \]

## 3.50.020 - Jurisdiction.
The municipal court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over traffic infractions arising under city ordinances and exclusive original criminal jurisdiction of all violations of city ordinances duly adopted by the city and shall have original jurisdiction of all other actions brought to enforce or recover license penalties or forfeitures declared or given by such ordinances or by state statutes. A hosting jurisdiction shall have exclusive original criminal and other jurisdiction as described in this section for all matters filed by a contracting city. The municipal court shall also have the jurisdiction as conferred by statute. The municipal court is empowered to forfeit cash bail or bail bonds and issue execution thereon; and in general to hear and determine all causes, civil or criminal, including traffic infractions, arising under such ordinances and to pronounce judgment in accordance therewith. A municipal court participating in the program established by the administrative office of the courts pursuant to RCW 2.56.160 shall have jurisdiction to take recognizance, approve bail, and arraign defendants held within its jurisdiction on warrants issued by any court of limited jurisdiction participating in the program.

## 3.50.030 - Violations bureau for traffic cases—Disposition of moneys collected.
Every city or town may establish and operate under the supervision of the municipal court a violations bureau to assist the court in processing traffic cases. Each municipal court shall designate the specific traffic offenses and traffic infractions under city or town ordinances which may be processed by the violations bureau.

A violations bureau may be authorized to process traffic infractions in conformity with chapter 46.63 RCW.

A violations bureau may be authorized to receive the posting of bail for specified offenses and, to the extent authorized by court order, permitted to accept forfeiture of bail and payment of penalties. Any violations bureau, upon accepting the prescribed bail, shall issue a receipt therefor to the alleged violator, acknowledging the posting thereof and informing the accused of the legal consequences of bail forfeiture. Any person charged with any criminal traffic offense within the authority of the violations bureau may, upon signing a written appearance, a written plea of guilty and a written waiver of trial, pay to the violations bureau the fine established for the offense charged and costs and this shall have the same effect as a court conviction. All penalties and forfeitures paid to a violations bureau for the violation of municipal ordinance shall be placed in the city or town general fund or such other fund as may be prescribed by ordinance of the city or town or laws of the state of Washington.

Any employees of an existing violations bureau of any city shall continue as city employees.
