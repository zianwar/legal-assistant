## 3.66.115 - "Legal financial obligation"—Defined. (Effective January 1, 2023.)
"Legal financial obligation" means a sum of money that is ordered by a district or municipal court of the state of Washington for legal financial obligations which may include restitution to the victim, court costs, county or interlocal drug funds, court-appointed attorneys' fees, and costs of defense, fines, and any other financial obligation that is assessed to the offender as a result of a conviction.

\[ [2022 c 260 § 18](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1412-S4.SL.pdf?cite=2022%20c%20260%20§%2018); \]

## 3.66.120 - Court-ordered restitution—Enforcement. (Effective until January 1, 2023.)
All court-ordered restitution obligations that are ordered as a result of a conviction for a criminal offense in a court of limited jurisdiction may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action by the party or entity to whom the legal financial obligation is owed. The judgment and sentence must identify the party or entity to whom restitution is owed so that the state, party, or entity may enforce the judgment.

All court-ordered restitution obligations may be enforced at any time during the ten-year period following the offender's release from total confinement or within ten years of entry of the judgment and sentence, whichever period is longer. Prior to the expiration of the initial ten-year period, the court may extend the criminal judgment an additional ten years for payment of court-ordered restitution only if the court finds that the offender has not made a good faith attempt to pay.

The party or entity to whom the court-ordered restitution obligation is owed may utilize any other remedies available to the party or entity to collect the court-ordered financial obligation.

Nothing in this section may be construed to deprive the court of the authority to determine whether the offender's failure to pay the legal financial obligation constitutes a violation of a condition of probation or to impose a sanction upon the offender if such a violation is found.

When any court-ordered restitution obligation entered pursuant to this title is paid or satisfied, the clerk of the court of limited jurisdiction in which the restitution obligation was ordered shall note upon the record of the court of limited jurisdiction satisfaction thereof including the date of the satisfaction.

\[ [2001 c 115 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1117-S.SL.pdf?cite=2001%20c%20115%20§%202); \]

## 3.66.140 - Offender supervision by another state.
1. If a person placed on probation for one year or more for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor by a district court requests permission to travel or transfer to another state, the assigned probation officer shall determine whether such request is subject to RCW 9.94A.745, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision. If such request is subject to the compact, the probation officer shall:

   a. Notify the department of corrections of the probationer's request;

   b. Provide the department of corrections with the supporting documentation it requests for processing an application for transfer;

   c. Notify the probationer of the fee due to the department of corrections for processing an application under the compact;

   e. Resume supervision if the probationer returns to this state before the term of probation expires.
