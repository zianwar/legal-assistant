These agreements may specify the scope of work, remuneration for services, and other charges deemed appropriate. Such agreements may authorize collection agencies to retain all or any portion of the interest collected on these accounts.

Courts of limited jurisdiction may enter into agreements with one or more financial institutions for the purpose of the collection of penalties, fines, costs, assessments, and forfeitures. The agreements may specify conditions, remuneration for services, and other charges deemed appropriate.

3. Servicing of delinquencies by collection agencies or by collecting attorneys in which the court retains control of its delinquencies shall not constitute assignment of debt.

4. For purposes of this section, the term debt shall include penalties, fines, costs, assessments, or forfeitures imposed by the courts.
