2. The department shall initiate a pilot project for the municipal watershed delineated by the Lake Whatcom hydrographic boundaries to determine what factors need to be considered to achieve water quality standards beyond those required under chapter 90.48 RCW and what additional management actions can be taken on state trust lands that can contribute to such higher water quality standards. The department shall establish an advisory committee consisting of a representative each of the city of Bellingham, Whatcom county, the Whatcom county water district 10, the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of health, and three general citizen members to assist in this pilot project. In the event of differences of opinion among the members of the advisory committee, the committee shall attempt to resolve these differences through various means, including the retention of facilitation or mediation services.

## 79.10.090 - Economic analysis of state lands held in trust—Scope—Use.
Periodically at intervals to be determined by the board, the department shall cause an economic analysis to be made of those state lands held in trust, where the nature of the trust makes maximization of the economic return to the beneficiaries of income from state lands the prime objective. The analysis shall be by specific tracts, or where such tracts are of similar economic characteristics, by groupings of such tracts.

The most recently made analysis shall be considered by the department in making decisions as to whether to sell or lease state lands, standing timber or crops thereon, or minerals therein, including but not limited to oil and gas and other hydrocarbons, rocks, gravel, and sand.

The economic analysis shall include, but shall not be limited to the following criteria: (1) Present and potential sale value; (2) present and probable future returns on the investment of permanent state funds; (3) probable future inflationary or deflationary trends; (4) present and probable future income from leases or the sale of land products; and (5) present and probable future tax income derivable therefrom specifically including additional state, local, and other tax revenues from potential private development of land currently used primarily for grazing and other similar low priority use; such private development would include, but not be limited to, development as irrigated agricultural land.
