Other deposits, if any, shall be returned to the respective bidders at the conclusion of each sale.

   b. It appears from the report that the sale was fairly conducted, that the purchaser was the highest responsible bidder at the sale, and that the sale price is not less than the appraised value of the property sold;

   c. The department is satisfied that the material sold would not, upon being readvertised and offered for sale, sell for a substantially higher price; and

   d. The payment required by law to be made at the time of making the sale has been made, and that the best interests of the state are being served.

2. Upon confirming a sale, the department shall enter upon its records the confirmation of sale and issue to the purchaser a contract of sale or bill of sale as the case may be, as is provided for in this chapter.

Further, the department may authorize the public agency or private landowner to dispose of the material without charge when necessary to implement disposal of material. No charge shall be required for any use of the material obtained under the provisions of this chapter when used solely on an authorized site.

## 79.140.210 - Mount St. Helens dredge spoils or materials.
1. [Empty]

   a. The legislature finds and declares that an extraordinary volume of material washed down onto beds of navigable waters and shorelands in the Toutle river, Coweeman river, and portions of the Cowlitz river following the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980.

   b. The legislature further finds that the owners of private lands located near the impacted rivers were authorized to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any dredge spoils removed from the river between the years of 1980 and 1995 without the necessity of any charge by the department.

   c. The legislature further finds that the dredging activities following the eruption of Mount St. Helens are no longer adequate to protect engineered structures on the affected rivers or the public health and safety of the communities located in proximity to the affected rivers. Future river dredging will be necessary as part of managing the post-eruption state of the rivers, and with the commencement of new dredging activities, the underlying conditions leading to the previous authority for private landowners to dispose of the dredged materials without the necessity of any charge by the department are replicated.

   d. The legislature further finds that just as between the years of 1980 and 1995, the dredge spoils placed upon adjacent publicly and privately owned property in the affected areas, if further disposed, will be of nominal value to the state and that it is in the best interests of the state to allow further disposal without charge.

2. All dredge spoil or materials removed from the state-owned beds and shores of the Toutle river, Coweeman river, and that portion of the Cowlitz river from two miles above the confluence of the Toutle river to its mouth deposited on adjacent public and private lands before December 31, 2035, as a result of dredging the affected rivers for navigation and flood control purposes that as of June 10, 2010, have not been sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by owners of the lands, may be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by owners of the lands without the necessity of any charge by the department and free and clear of any interest of the department.
