   a. For state forestlands acquired through RCW 79.22.040 or by exchange for lands acquired through RCW 79.22.040:

      i. The expense incurred by the state for administration, reforestation, and protection, not to exceed twenty-five percent, which rate of percentage shall be determined by the board, must be returned to the forest development account created in RCW 79.64.100. During the 2017-2019, 2019-2021, and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia, the board may increase the twenty-five percent limitation up to twenty-seven percent.

      ii. Any balance remaining must be paid to the county in which the land is located or, for counties participating in a land pool created under RCW 79.22.140, to each participating county proportionate to its contribution of asset value to the land pool as determined by the board. Payments made under this subsection are to be paid, distributed, and prorated, except as otherwise provided in this section, to the various funds in the same manner as general taxes are paid and distributed during the year of payment. However, in order to test county flexibility in distributing state forestland revenue, a county may in its discretion pay, distribute, and prorate payments made under this subsection of moneys derived from state forestlands acquired by exchange between July 28, 2019, and June 30, 2020, for lands acquired through RCW 79.22.040, within the same county, in the same manner as general taxes are paid and distributed during the year of payment for the former state forestlands that were subject to the exchange.

      iii. Any balance remaining, paid to a county with a population of less than sixteen thousand, must first be applied to the reduction of any indebtedness existing in the current expense fund of the county during the year of payment.

      iv. With regard to moneys remaining under this subsection (1)(a), within seven working days of receipt of these moneys, the department shall certify to the state treasurer the amounts to be distributed to the counties. The state treasurer shall distribute funds to the counties four times per month, with no more than ten days between each payment date.

   b. For state forestlands acquired through RCW 79.22.010 or by exchange for lands acquired through RCW 79.22.010, except as provided in RCW 79.64.120:

      i. Fifty percent shall be placed in the forest development account.

      ii. Fifty percent shall be prorated and distributed to the state general fund, to be dedicated for the benefit of the public schools, to the county in which the land is located or, for counties participating in a land pool created under RCW 79.22.140, to each participating county proportionate to its contribution of asset value to the land pool as determined by the board, and according to the relative proportions of tax levies of all taxing districts in the county. The portion to be distributed to the state general fund shall be based on the regular school levy rate under RCW 84.52.065 (1) and (2) and the levy rate for any school district enrichment levies. With regard to the portion to be distributed to the counties, the department shall certify to the state treasurer the amounts to be distributed within seven working days of receipt of the money. The state treasurer shall distribute funds to the counties four times per month, with no more than ten days between each payment date. The money distributed to the county must be paid, distributed, and prorated to the various other funds in the same manner as general taxes are paid and distributed during the year of payment.

2. A school district may transfer amounts deposited in its debt service fund pursuant to this section into its capital projects fund as authorized in RCW 28A.320.330.

Expenditures from the account may be used only for the payment of costs, including management and administrative costs, incurred on forest health treatments necessary to improve forest health as defined in RCW 79.10.520. Only the commissioner or the commissioner's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The board of natural resources has oversight of the account, and the commissioner must periodically report to the board of natural resources as to the status of the account, its disbursement, and receipts. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

   b. The forest health revolving account is an interest-bearing account and the interest must be credited to the account.

2. Beginning calendar year 2018, the fund balance attributable to the receipts from the proceeds of forest health treatment sales is subject to the following:

   a. Any unobligated amounts up to ten million dollars at the end of the calendar year are not subject to disbursements to trust beneficiaries, the resource management account, or the forest development account.

   b. Any unobligated amounts exceeding ten million dollars at the end of the calendar year must be disbursed to the appropriate trust beneficiaries as determined by the board of natural resources and these disbursements are not subject to the deductions for the resource management cost account described in RCW 79.64.040 or the forest development account described in RCW 79.64.110.

   c. If the board of natural resources determines that the department has permanently discontinued using the forest health revolving account for the forest health treatments under RCW 79.10.520 and 79.10.530, the board must disburse all remaining fund balance attributable to the proceeds of forest health treatment sales to the appropriate trust beneficiaries, and these disbursements are not subject to the deductions for the resource management cost account described in RCW 79.64.040 or the forest development account described in RCW 79.64.110.

3. [Empty]

   a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, expenditures on state lands and state forestlands for forest health treatments by the department from the forest health revolving account must be consistent with the prioritization policy under RCW 79.10.520 and the prioritization list created under RCW 79.10.530.

   b. The department is not bound to adhere to the list submitted to the legislature under RCW 79.10.520 in the event that emerging information or changed circumstances support a reprioritization of lands consistent with the policy created under RCW 79.10.520.

   c. The department is not required to apply the prioritization policy of RCW 79.10.520 where doing so would be incompatible with the conditions of funding provided by the federal government or another organization that is contributing funds to forest health treatments involving the department.
