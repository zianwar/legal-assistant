The attorney general of the state of Washington is hereby required and authorized to condemn said property interests found to be necessary for the public purposes of the state of Washington, as provided in RCW 79.36.310, and upon being furnished with a certified copy of the resolution of the department, describing said property interests found to be necessary for the purposes set forth in RCW 79.36.310, the attorney general shall immediately take steps to acquire said property interests by exercising the state's right of eminent domain under the provisions of chapter 8.04 RCW, and in any condemnation action herein authorized, the resolution so describing the property interests found to be necessary for the purposes set forth above shall, in the absence of a showing of bad faith, arbitrary, capricious, or fraudulent action, be conclusive as to the public use and real necessity for the acquisition of said property interests for a public purpose, and said property interests shall be awarded to the state without the necessity of either pleading or proving that the department was unable to agree with the owner or owners of said private property interest for its purchase.

Supp. 1945 § 5823-31; \]

## 79.36.330 - Disposal of property interests acquired.
In the event the department should determine that the property interests acquired under the authority of this chapter are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were acquired, the department shall dispose of the same in the following manner, when in the discretion of the department it is to the best interests of the state of Washington to do so, except that property purchased with educational funds or held in trust for educational purposes shall be sold only in the same manner as are state lands:

1. Where the state property necessitating the acquisition of private property interests for access purposes under authority of this chapter is sold or exchanged, the acquired property interests may be sold or exchanged as an appurtenance of the state property when it is determined by the department that sale or exchange of the state property and acquired property interests as one parcel is in the best interests of the state.

2. If the acquired property interests are not sold or exchanged as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the department shall notify the person or persons from whom the property interest was acquired, stating that the property interests are to be sold, and that the person or persons shall have the right to purchase the same at the appraised price. The notice shall be given by registered letter or certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed to the last known address of the person or persons. If the address of the person or persons is unknown, the notice shall be published twice in an official newspaper of general circulation in the county where the lands or a portion thereof is located. The second notice shall be published not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the notice is first published. The person or persons shall have thirty days after receipt of the registered letter or five days after the last date of publication, as the case may be, to notify the department, in writing, of their intent to purchase the offered property interest. The purchaser shall include with his or her notice of intention to purchase, cash payment, certified check, or money order in an amount not less than one-third of the appraised price. No instrument conveying property interests shall issue from the department until the full price of the property is received by the department. All costs of publication required under this section shall be added to the appraised price and collected by the department upon sale of the property interests.

3. If the property interests are not sold or exchanged as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the department shall notify the owners of land abutting the property interests in the same manner as provided in subsection (2) of this section and their notice of intent to purchase shall be given in the manner and in accordance with the same time limits as are set forth in subsection (2) of this section. However, if more than one abutting owner gives notice of intent to purchase the property interests, the department shall apportion them in relation to the lineal footage bordering each side of the property interests to be sold, and apportion the costs to the interested purchasers in relation thereto. Further, no sale is authorized by this section unless the department is satisfied that the amounts to be received from the several purchasers will equal or exceed the appraised price of the entire parcel plus any costs of publishing notices.

4. If no sale or exchange is consummated as provided in subsections (1) through (3) of this section, the department shall sell the properties in the same manner as state lands are sold.

5. Any disposal of property interests authorized by this chapter shall be subject to any existing rights previously granted by the department.

## 79.36.350 - Application for right-of-way.
1. Any person, firm, or corporation engaged in the business of logging or lumbering, quarrying, mining or removing sand, gravel, or other valuable materials from land, and desirous of obtaining a right-of-way for the purpose of transporting or moving timber, minerals, stone, sand, gravel, or other valuable materials from other lands, over and across any state lands, or tide or shore lands belonging to the state, or any such lands sold or leased by the state since the fifteenth day of June, 1911, shall file with the department upon a form to be furnished for that purpose, a written application for such right-of-way, accompanied by a plat showing the location of the right-of-way applied for with references to the boundaries of the government section in which the lands over and across which such right-of-way is desired are located. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, upon the filing of such application and plat, the department shall cause the lands embraced within the right-of-way applied for, to be inspected, and all timber thereon, and all damages to the lands affected which may be caused by the use of such right-of-way, to be appraised, and shall notify the applicant of the appraised value of such timber and such appraisement of damages. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, upon the payment to the department of the amount of the appraised value of timber and damages, the department shall issue in duplicate a right-of-way certificate setting forth the terms and conditions upon which such right-of-way is granted, as provided in the preceding sections, and providing that whenever such right-of-way shall cease to be used for the purpose for which it was granted, or shall not be used in accordance with such terms and conditions, it shall be deemed forfeited. One copy of such certificate shall be filed in the office of the department and one copy delivered to the applicant.

2. The department's obligation to issue a right-of-way certificate as provided in subsection (1) of this section does not apply to an application for a right-of-way over land in which the federal government claims the exclusive right to grant an easement or right-of-way to third parties over such land. However, this exception does not apply where the department disputes the claim by the federal government. The existence of this section may not be deemed an acknowledgment that the federal government holds any such exclusive granting rights.

The department may grant to any person such easements and rights in public lands, not otherwise provided in law, as the applicant applying therefor may acquire in privately owned lands.
