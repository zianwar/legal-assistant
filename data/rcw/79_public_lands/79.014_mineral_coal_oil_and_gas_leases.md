## 79.14.020 - Leases authorized—Terms—Duration.
The department is authorized to lease public lands for the purpose of prospecting for, developing, and producing oil, gas, or other hydrocarbon substances. Each such lease is to be composed of not more than six hundred forty acres or an entire government surveyed section, except a lease on river bed, lake bed, tide and submerged lands which is to be composed of not more than one thousand nine hundred twenty acres. All leases shall contain such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the rules adopted by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Leases may be for an initial term of from five up to ten years and shall be extended for so long thereafter as lessee shall comply with one of the following conditions: (1) Prosecute development on the leased land with the due diligence of a prudent operator upon encountering oil, gas, or other hydrocarbon substances; (2) produce any of said substances from the leased lands; (3) engage in drilling, deepening, repairing, or redrilling any well thereon; or (4) participate in a unit plan to which the commissioner has consented under RCW 78.52.450.

The department shall require as a prerequisite to the issuing of any lease a rental as set by the board but not less than one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre or such prorated share of the rental per acre as the state's mineral rights ownership for the first year of such lease, payable in advance to the department at the time the lease is awarded and a like rental annually in advance thereafter so long as such lease remains in force. However, the rental shall cease at such time as royalty accrues to the state from production from such lease. Commencing with the lease year beginning on or after oil, gas, or other hydrocarbon substances are first produced in quantities deemed paying quantities by lessee on the land subject to such lease, lessee shall pay a minimum royalty as set by the board but not less than five dollars per acre or fraction thereof or such prorated share of the rental per acre as the state's mineral rights ownership at the expiration of each year. Royalties payable by the lessee shall be the royalties from production as provided for in RCW 79.14.070 or the minimum royalty provided herein, whichever is greater. However, if such a lease is unitized, the minimum royalty shall be payable only on the leased acreage after production is obtained in such paying quantities from such lease.

## 79.14.040 - Compensation to owners of private rights and to state for surface damage.
No lessee shall commence any operation upon lands covered by the lease until such lessee has provided for compensation to owners of private rights therein according to law, or in lieu thereof, filed a surety bond with the department in an amount sufficient in the opinion of the commissioner to cover such compensation until the amount of compensation is determined by agreement, arbitration, or judicial decision and has provided for compensation to the state of Washington for damage to the surface rights of the state in accordance with the rules adopted by the department.

## 79.14.050 - Drilling operations beyond lease term—Lease provisions.
All leases shall provide that if oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances are not encountered on or before the end of the initial term, the lease shall not terminate if the lessee is then prosecuting drilling operations on the leased lands with due diligence, in which event the same shall remain in force so long as lessee shall keep one string of tools in operation on the leased lands, allowing not to exceed ninety days between the completion of one well and the commencement of the next until such substances are encountered in quantities deemed paying quantities by lessee. All leases shall further provide that if oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances in paying quantities shall have been discovered on the leased lands prior to the expiration of the initial term, then in the event at any time after the expiration of the initial term production on the leased land shall cease from any cause, the lease shall not terminate provided lessee resumes operations for the drilling of a well or the restoration of production within ninety days from such cessation. The lease shall remain in force during the prosecution of such operations, and if production results therefrom, then so long as production continues.

However, before any such cancellation is made, the department shall mail to the lessee by registered mail, addressed to the post office address of such lessee shown by the records of the department, a notice of intention to cancel such lease specifying the default for which the lease is subject to cancellation. If lessee shall, within thirty days after the mailing of said notice to the lessee, commence and thereafter diligently and in good faith prosecute the remedying of the default specified in such notice, then no cancellation of the lease shall be entered by the department. Otherwise, the cancellation shall be made and all rights of the lessee under the lease shall automatically terminate, except that lessee shall retain the right to continue its possession and operation of any well or wells in regard to which lessee is not in default. Further, failure to pay rental and royalty required under leases within the time prescribed therein shall automatically and without notice work a forfeiture of such leases and of all rights thereunder. Upon the expiration, forfeiture, or surrender of any lease, no new lease covering the lands or any of them embraced by such expired, forfeited, or surrendered lease, shall be issued for a period of ten days following the date of such expiration, forfeiture, or surrender. If more than one application for a lease covering such lands or any of them shall be made during such ten-day period the department shall issue a lease to such lands or any of them to the person offering the greatest cash bonus for such lease at a public auction to be held at the time and place and in the manner as the department shall adopt by rule.

## 79.14.100 - Cooperative or unit plans—Communization or drilling agreements.
For the purpose of more properly conserving the natural resources of any oil or gas pool, field, or like area, lessees thereon and their representatives may unite with each other, or jointly or separately with others, in collectively adopting and operating under a cooperative or unit plan of development or operation of such pool, field, or like area, or any part thereof, whenever determined and certified by the department to be necessary or advisable in the public interest. The department is authorized, in its discretion, with the consent of the holders of leases involved, in order to conform with the terms and conditions of any such cooperative or unit plan to establish, alter, change, or revoke exploration, drilling, producing, rental, and royalty requirements of such leases with like consent on the part of the lessees, in connection with the institution and operation of any such cooperative or unit plan as the department may deem necessary or proper to secure the proper protection of the public interest.

When separate tracts cannot be independently developed and operated in conformity with an established well spacing or development program, any lease or any portion thereof may be pooled with other lands, whether or not owned by the state of Washington under a communization or drilling agreement providing for an apportionment of production or royalties among the separate tracts of land comprising the drilling or spacing unit when determined by the department to be in the public interest, and operations or production pursuant to such an agreement shall be deemed to be operations or production as to each such lease committed thereto.

The term of any lease that has become the subject of any cooperative or unit plan of development or operation of a pool, field, or like area, which plan has the approval of the department, shall continue in force until the termination of such plan, and in the event such plan is terminated prior to the expiration of any such lease, the original term of such lease shall continue. Any lease under this chapter hereinafter committed to any such plan embracing lands that are in part within and in part outside of the area covered by any such plan, shall be segregated in separate leases as to the lands committed and the land not committed as of the effective date of unitization.
