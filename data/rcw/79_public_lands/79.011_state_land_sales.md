1. The purpose of this section is to provide revenues to the state and its various taxing districts through the sale of public lands which are currently used primarily for grazing and similar low priority purposes, by enabling their development as irrigated agricultural lands.

2.

The board shall thereupon determine whether the sale of the lands is in the public interest and upon an affirmative finding shall offer such lands for sale. However, any such parcel of land shall be sold to the highest bidder but only at a bid equal to or higher than the last appraised valuation thereof as established by appraisers for the department for any such parcel of land. Further, any lands lying within United States reclamation areas, the sale price of which is limited or otherwise regulated pursuant to federal reclamation laws or regulations thereunder, need not be offered for sale so long as such limitations or regulations are applicable thereto.

3. The department shall adopt appropriate rules defining properties of such irrigated agricultural potential and shall take into account the economic benefits to the locality in classifying such properties for sale.
