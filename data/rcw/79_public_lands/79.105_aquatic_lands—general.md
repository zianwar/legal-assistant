## 79.105.001 - Intent—2005 c 155.
This act is intended to make technical amendments to certain codified statutes that deal with the department of natural resources. Any statutory changes made by this act should be interpreted as technical in nature and not be interpreted to have any substantive policy implications.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 1001](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%201001); \]

## 79.105.010 - Aquatic lands—Findings.
The legislature finds that state-owned aquatic lands are a finite natural resource of great value and an irreplaceable public heritage. The legislature recognizes that the state owns these aquatic lands in fee and has delegated to the department the responsibility to manage these lands for the benefit of the public. The legislature finds that water-dependent industries and activities have played a major role in the history of the state and will continue to be important in the future. The legislature finds that revenues derived from leases of state-owned aquatic lands should be used to enhance opportunities for public recreation, shoreline access, environmental protection, and other public benefits associated with the aquatic lands of the state. The legislature further finds that aquatic lands are faced with conflicting use demands.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 139](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%20139); [1984 c 221 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c221.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20221%20§%201); \]

## 79.105.020 - Purpose—Articulation of management philosophy.
The purpose of RCW 79.105.060, 79.105.230, 79.105.280, and 79.105.010 through 79.105.040 is to articulate a management philosophy to guide the exercise of the state's ownership interest and the exercise of the department's management authority, and to establish standards for determining equitable and predictable lease rates for users of state-owned aquatic lands.

\[ 2005 c 155 § 101. FORMERLY PART OF RCW  79.90.450; \]

## 79.105.030 - Aquatic lands—Management guidelines.
The management of state-owned aquatic lands shall be in conformance with constitutional and statutory requirements. The manager of state-owned aquatic lands shall strive to provide a balance of public benefits for all citizens of the state. The public benefits provided by state-owned aquatic lands are varied and include:

1. Encouraging direct public use and access;

2. Fostering water-dependent uses;

3. Ensuring environmental protection;

4. Utilizing renewable resources.

Generating revenue in a manner consistent with subsections (1) through (4) of this section is a public benefit.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 140](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%20140); [1984 c 221 § 2](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c221.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20221%20§%202); \]

## 79.105.040 - Application to existing property rights—Application of shoreline management act.
Nothing in *this chapter or RCW 79.120.040 or 79.120.060 shall modify or affect any existing legal rights involving the boundaries of, title to, or vested property rights in aquatic lands or waterways. Nothing in *this chapter shall modify, alter, or otherwise affect the applicability of chapter 90.58 RCW.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 157](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%20157); [1984 c 221 § 20](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c221.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20221%20§%2020); \]

## 79.105.050 - Fostering use of aquatic environment—Limitation.
The department shall foster the commercial and recreational use of the aquatic environment for production of food, fibre, income, and public enjoyment from state-owned aquatic lands and from associated waters, and to this end the department may develop and improve production and harvesting of seaweeds and sealife attached to or growing on aquatic land or contained in aquaculture containers, but nothing in this section alters the responsibility of other state agencies for their normal management of fish, shellfish, game, and water.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 141](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%20141); [2003 c 334 § 541](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1252.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20334%20§%20541); [1971 ex.s. c 234 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1971ex1c234.pdf?cite=1971%20ex.s.%20c%20234%20§%208); \]

## 79.105.210 - Aquatic lands—Preservation and enhancement of water-dependent uses—Leasing authority.
1. The management of state-owned aquatic lands shall preserve and enhance water-dependent uses. Water-dependent uses shall be favored over other uses in state-owned aquatic land planning and in resolving conflicts between competing lease applications. In cases of conflict between water-dependent uses, priority shall be given to uses which enhance renewable resources, waterborne commerce, and the navigational and biological capacity of the waters, and to statewide interests as distinguished from local interests.

2. Nonwater-dependent use of state-owned aquatic lands is a low-priority use providing minimal public benefits and shall not be permitted to expand or be established in new areas except in exceptional circumstances where it is compatible with water-dependent uses occurring in or planned for the area.

3. The department shall consider the natural values of state-owned aquatic lands as wildlife habitat, natural area preserve, representative ecosystem, or spawning area prior to issuing any initial lease or authorizing any change in use. The department may withhold from leasing lands which it finds to have significant natural values, or may provide within any lease for the protection of such values.

4. The power to lease state-owned aquatic lands is vested in the department, which has the authority to make leases upon terms, conditions, and length of time in conformance with the state Constitution and chapters 79.105 through 79.140 RCW.

5. State-owned aquatic lands shall not be leased to persons or organizations which discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, age, or disability.

## 79.105.240 - Determination of annual rent rates for lease of aquatic lands for water-dependent uses.
Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, annual rent rates for the lease of state-owned aquatic lands for water-dependent uses shall be determined as follows:

1. [Empty]

   a. The assessed land value, exclusive of improvements, as determined by the county assessor, of the upland tax parcel used in conjunction with the leased area or, if there are no such uplands, of the nearest upland tax parcel used for water-dependent purposes divided by the parcel area equals the upland value.

   b. The upland value times the area of leased aquatic lands times thirty percent equals the aquatic land value.

2. As of July 1, 1989, and each July 1st thereafter, the department shall determine the real capitalization rate to be applied to water-dependent aquatic land leases commencing or being adjusted under subsection (3)(a) of this section in that fiscal year. The real capitalization rate shall be the real rate of return, except that until June 30, 1989, the real capitalization rate shall be five percent and thereafter it shall not change by more than one percentage point in any one year or be more than seven percent or less than three percent.

3. The annual rent shall be:

   a. Determined initially, and redetermined every four years or as otherwise provided in the lease, by multiplying the aquatic land value times the real capitalization rate; and

   b. Adjusted by the inflation rate each year in which the rent is not determined under (a) of this subsection.

4. If the upland parcel used in conjunction with the leased area is not assessed or has an assessed value inconsistent with the purposes of the lease, the nearest comparable upland parcel used for similar purposes shall be substituted and the lease payment determined in the same manner as provided in this section.

5. For the purposes of this section, "upland tax parcel" is a tax parcel, some portion of which has upland characteristics. Filled tidelands or shorelands with upland characteristics which abut state-owned aquatic land shall be considered as uplands in determining aquatic land values.

6. The annual rent for filled state-owned aquatic lands that have the characteristics of uplands shall be determined in accordance with RCW 79.105.270 in those cases in which the state owns the fill and has a right to charge for the fill.

7. For all new leases for other water-dependent uses, issued after December 31, 1997, the initial annual water-dependent rent shall be determined by the methods in subsections (1) through (6) of this section.

## 79.105.250 - Log storage rents.
1. Until June 30, 1989, the log storage rents per acre shall be the average rents the log storage leases in effect on July 1, 1984, would have had under the formula for water-dependent leases as set out in RCW 79.105.240, except that the aquatic land values shall be thirty percent of the assessed value of the abutting upland parcels exclusive of improvements, if they are assessed. If the abutting upland parcel is not assessed, the nearest assessed upland parcel shall be used.

2. On July 1, 1989, and every four years thereafter, the base log storage rents established under subsection (1) of this section shall be adjusted in proportion to the change in average water-dependent lease rates per acre since the date the log storage rates were last established under this section.

3. The annual rent shall be adjusted by the inflation rate each year in which the rent is not determined under subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

4. If the lease provides for seasonal use so that portions of the leased area are available for public use without charge part of the year, the annual rent may be discounted to reflect such public use in accordance with rules adopted by the board.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 148](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%20148); [1984 c 221 § 8](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c221.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20221%20§%208); \]

1. For leases in effect on October 1, 1984, the rent shall remain at the annual rate in effect on September 30, 1984, until the next lease anniversary date, at which time rent established under RCW 79.105.240 or 79.105.250 shall become effective. If the first rent amount established is an increase of more than one hundred dollars and is more than thirty-three percent above the rent in effect on September 30, 1984, the annual rent shall not increase in any year by more than thirty-three percent of the difference between the previous rent and the rent established under RCW 79.105.240 or 79.105.250. If the first rent amount established under RCW 79.105.240 or 79.105.250 is more than thirty-three percent below the rent in effect on September 30, 1984, the annual rent shall not decrease in any year by more than thirty-three percent of the difference between the previous rent and the rent established under RCW 79.105.240 or 79.105.250. Thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the annual rental established under RCW 79.105.240 or 79.105.250 shall not increase more than fifty percent in any year.

## 79.105.270 - Aquatic lands—Leases/rents for nonwater-dependent uses.
Leases for nonwater-dependent uses of state-owned aquatic lands shall be charged the fair market rental value of the leased lands, determined in accordance with appraisal techniques specified by rule. However, rents for nonwater-dependent uses shall always be more than the amount that would be charged as rent for a water-dependent use of the same parcel.

## 79.105.320 - Aquatic lands—Administrative review of proposed rent.
The manager shall, by rule, provide for an administrative review of any state-owned aquatic land rent proposed to be charged. The rules shall require that the lessee or applicant for release file a request for review within thirty days after the manager has notified the lessee or applicant of the rent due. For leases issued by the department, the final authority for the review rests with the board. For leases managed under RCW 79.105.420, the final authority for the review rests with the appropriate port commission. If the request for review is made within thirty days after the manager's final determination as to the rental, the lessee may pay rent at the preceding year's rate pending completion of the review, and shall pay any additional rent or be entitled to a refund, with interest thirty days after announcement of the decision. The interest rate shall be fixed by rule adopted by the board and shall not be less than six percent per annum. Nothing in this section abrogates the right of an aggrieved party to pursue legal remedies. For purposes of this section, "manager" is the department except where state-owned aquatic lands are managed by a port district, in which case "manager" is the port district.

Consistent with RCW 79.105.030, the department must develop procedures and criteria that state the manner in which gifts of aquatic land, received after July 27, 2003, may occur. No gift of aquatic land may be accepted until: (a) An appraisal of the value of the land has been prepared; (b) an environmental site assessment has been conducted; and (c) the title property report has been examined and approved by the attorney general of the state. The results of the appraisal, the site assessment, and the examination of the title property report must be submitted to the board before the department may accept a gift of aquatic land.

2. The authorization to accept gifts of aquatic land within the state extends to aquatic land accepted as gifts prior to July 27, 2003.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 163](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%20163); [2003 c 176 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1246.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20176%20§%201); \]

## 79.105.420 - Management of certain aquatic lands by port district—Agreement—Rent—Model management agreement.
1. Upon request of a port district, the department and port district may enter into an agreement authorizing the port district to manage state-owned aquatic lands abutting or used in conjunction with and contiguous to uplands owned, leased, or otherwise managed by a port district, for port purposes as provided in Title 53 RCW. The agreement shall include, but not be limited to, provisions defining the specific area to be managed, the term, conditions of occupancy, reservations, periodic review, and other conditions to ensure consistency with the state Constitution and the policies of this chapter. If a port district acquires operating management, lease, or ownership of real property which abuts state-owned aquatic lands currently under lease from the state to a person other than the port district, the port district shall manage state-owned aquatic lands if: (a) The port district acquires the leasehold interest in accordance with state law, or (b) the current lessee and the department agree to termination of the current lease to accommodate management by the port. The administration of state-owned aquatic lands covered by a management agreement shall be consistent with the aquatic land policies of chapters 79.105 through 79.140 RCW and the implementing rules adopted by the department. The administrative procedures for management of the lands shall be those of Title 53 RCW.

2. No rent is due the state for the use of state-owned aquatic lands managed under this section for water-dependent or water-oriented uses. If a port district manages state-owned aquatic lands under this section and either leases or otherwise permits any person to use the lands, the rental fee attributable to the state-owned aquatic land only shall be comparable to the rent charged lessees for the same or similar uses by the department. However, a port district need not itemize for the lessee any charges for state-owned aquatic lands improved by the port district for use by carriers by water. If a port leases state-owned aquatic lands to any person for nonwater-dependent use, eighty-five percent of the revenue attributable to the rent of the state-owned aquatic land only shall be paid to the state.

3. Upon application for a management agreement, and so long as the application is pending and being diligently pursued, no rent is due the department for the lease by the port district of state-owned aquatic lands included within the application for water-dependent or water-oriented uses.

4. The department and representatives of the port industry shall develop a proposed model management agreement which shall be used as the basis for negotiating the management agreements required by this section. The model management agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the board.

\[ [2005 c 155 § 146](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1491-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20155%20§%20146); [1984 c 221 § 6](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1984c221.pdf?cite=1984%20c%20221%20§%206); \]

## 79.105.430 - Private recreational docks—Mooring buoys.
1. The abutting residential owner to state-owned shorelands, tidelands, or related beds of navigable waters, other than harbor areas, may install and maintain without charge a dock on the areas if used exclusively for private recreational purposes and the area is not subject to prior rights, including any rights of upland, tideland, or shoreland owners as provided in RCW 79.125.400, 79.125.460, 79.125.410, and 79.130.010. The dock cannot be sold or leased separately from the upland residence. The dock cannot be used to moor boats for commercial or residential use. This permission is subject to applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations governing location, design, construction, size, and length of the dock. Nothing in this subsection (1) prevents the abutting owner from obtaining a lease if otherwise provided by law.

2. The abutting residential owner to state-owned shorelands, tidelands, or related beds of navigable waters, other than harbor areas, may install and maintain a mooring buoy without charge if the boat that is moored to the buoy is used for private recreational purposes, the area is not subject to prior rights, including any rights of upland, tideland, or shoreland owners as provided in RCW 79.125.400, 79.125.460, 79.125.410, and 79.130.010, and the buoy will not obstruct the use of mooring buoys previously authorized by the department.

   a. The buoy must be located as near to the upland residence as practical, consistent with applicable rules and regulations and the provisions of this section. The buoy must be located, or relocated if necessary, to accommodate the use of lawfully installed and maintained buoys.

   b. If two or more residential owners, who otherwise qualify for free use under the provisions of this section, are in dispute over assertion of rights to install and maintain a mooring buoy in the same location, they may seek formal settlement through adjudication in superior court for the county in which the buoy site is located. In the adjudication, preference must be given tothe residential owner that first installed and continually maintained and used a buoy on that site, if it meets all applicable rules, regulations, and provisions of this section, and then to the owner of the residential property nearest the site. Nothing in this section requires the department to mediate or otherwise resolve disputes between residential owners over the use of the same site for a mooring buoy.

   c. The buoy cannot be sold or leased separately from the abutting residential property. The buoy cannot be used to moor boats for commercial or residential use, nor to moor boats over sixty feet in length.

   d. If the department determines that it is necessary for secure moorage, the abutting residential owner may install and maintain a second mooring buoy, under the same provisions as the first, the use of which is limited to a second mooring line to the boat moored at the first buoy.

   e. The permission granted in this subsection (2) is subject to applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations governing location, design, installation, maintenance, and operation of the mooring buoy, anchoring system, and moored boat. Nothing in this subsection (2) prevents a boat owner from obtaining a lease if otherwise provided by law. This subsection (2) also applies to areas that have been designated by the commissioner or the fish and wildlife commission as aquatic reserves.

3. This permission to install and maintain a recreational dock or mooring buoy may be revoked by the department, or the department may direct the owner of a recreational dock or mooring buoy to relocate their dock or buoy, if the department makes a finding of public necessity to protect waterward access, ingress rights of other landowners, public health or safety, or public resources. Circumstances prompting a finding of public necessity may include, but are not limited to, the dock, buoy, anchoring system, or boat posing a hazard or obstruction to navigation or fishing, contributing to degradation of aquatic habitat, or contributing to decertification of shellfish beds otherwise suitable for commercial or recreational harvest. The revocation may be appealed as provided for under RCW 79.105.160.

4. Nothing in this section authorizes a boat owner to abandon a vessel at a recreational dock, mooring buoy, or elsewhere.

## 79.105.500 - Aquatic land dredged material disposal sites—Findings.
The legislature finds that the department provides, manages, and monitors aquatic land dredged material disposal sites on state-owned aquatic lands for materials dredged from rivers, harbors, and shipping lanes. These disposal sites are approved through a cooperative planning process by the departments of natural resources and ecology, the United States army corps of engineers, and the United States environmental protection agency in cooperation with the Puget Sound partnership. These disposal sites are essential to the commerce and well-being of the citizens of the state of Washington. Management and environmental monitoring of these sites are necessary to protect environmental quality and to assure appropriate use of state-owned aquatic lands. The creation of an aquatic land dredged material disposal site account is a reasonable means to enable and facilitate proper management and environmental monitoring of these disposal sites.
