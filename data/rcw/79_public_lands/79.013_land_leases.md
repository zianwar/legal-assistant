## 79.13.420 - Nondefault or early termination provision.
1. For the purposes of this section, "nondefault or early termination provision" means a provision that authorizes the department to terminate a lease in the event the department includes the leased land in a plan for higher and better use, land exchange, or sale.

2. Any nondefault or early termination provision included in a state land lease for agricultural or grazing purposes must:

   a. Require advance written notice of at least one hundred eighty days by the department to the lessee prior to termination of the lease; and

   b. Require the department to provide to the lessee, along with the notice under (a) of this subsection, written documentation demonstrating that the department has included the leased land in a plan for higher and better use, land exchange, or sale.

3. This section does not require the department to include a nondefault or early termination provision in any state land lease for agricultural or grazing purposes.

4. This section does not prohibit the department from allowing the lessee to surrender the leasehold subject to terms provided in the lease.

5. This section does not prohibit the department from executing other lease provisions designed to protect the interests of the lessee in the event that the lease is terminated under a nondefault or early termination provision.

6. In the event that the department exercises a nondefault or early termination provision in a state land lease for agricultural or grazing purposes, the department shall compensate the lessee according to the following schedule:

   a. For grazing leases, the department shall pay to the lessee the annual rent for the land subject to the lease, multiplied by a factor of six, except that the department need not compensate the lessee for any years that are specifically designated in the lease as nongrazing years.

   b. For agricultural leases, the department shall pay to the lessee the expected net return the lessee would have realized from crops raised on the leased land, which shall be calculated according to the following formula: The annual net revenue per acre for the class of crop produced by the lessee, less the rental rate per acre for the land leased by the lessee; multiplied by the number of acres leased by the lessee. For purposes of this subsection, the annual net revenue per acre for a class of crop must be calculated according to the most recent rolling average annual net rental return per acre for that class of crop as established by the county assessor of the county in which the leased land is located or, if the county assessor of the county in which the land is located has not established an annual net rental return per acre, as established by the county assessor of the nearest county in which the county assessor has established such an annual net rental return per acre. The annual net rental return per acre, as established by the county assessor, must be adjusted to reflect the total annual net revenue per acre.

   c. For both grazing leases and agricultural leases, the department shall make payments to the lessee on an annual basis for the remaining term of the terminated lease, unless the department and the lessee agree to an alternate schedule of payments. In the event that payments are made on any schedule other than on an annual basis, any advance payments must be subjected to an appropriate discount rate in order to reflect the net present value of the compensation owed by the department.

   d. For both grazing leases and agricultural leases, in the event that the lessee has placed any improvements, as authorized under RCW 79.13.050, on the land that is subject to the lease, the department is responsible for compensating the lessee for the fair market value of the improvements. In the event that an agreement cannot be reached between the state and the lessee on the fair market value of the improvements, the valuation must be determined as prescribed under RCW 79.13.160.

7. In the event that the department's exercise of a nondefault or early termination provision in a state land lease for agricultural or grazing purposes results in the removal of fencing from the land subject to the lease, the department is responsible for ensuring the replacement of any removed fencing.

8. In the event that the department's exercise of a nondefault or early termination provision in a state land lease for agricultural or grazing purposes causes the lessee to incur a financial penalty as a result of an early withdrawal from a natural resources conservation service program, the department is responsible for reimbursing the lessee for payment of the financial penalty.

9. The compensation and reimbursement available to a lessee under subsections (6) and (8) of this section, respectively, is the sole financial remedy available to the lessee based on the department's exercise of a nondefault or early termination provision in an agriculture or grazing lease. Appeal rights under RCW 79.02.030 are unaffected by the relief provided in this section.

## 79.13.500 - Amateur radio repeater stations—Legislative intent.
The department leases state lands and space on towers located on state lands to amateur radio operators for their repeater stations. These sites are necessary to maintain emergency communications for public safety and for use in disaster relief and search and rescue support.

The licensed amateur radio operators of the state provide thousands of hours of public communications service to the state every year. Their communication network spans the entire state, based in individual residences and linked across the state through a series of mountain-top repeater stations. The amateur radio operators install and maintain their radios and the electronic repeater stations at their own expense. The amateur radio operators who use their equipment to perform public services should not bear the sole responsibility for supporting the electronic repeater stations.

In recognition of the essential role performed by the amateur radio operators in emergency communications, the legislature intends to reduce the rental fee paid by the amateur radio operators while assuring the department full market rental for the use of state-owned property.

\[ [2003 c 334 § 461](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1252.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20334%20§%20461); [1988 c 209 § 1](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c209.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20209%20§%201); \]

## 79.13.510 - Amateur radio electronic repeater sites and units—Reduced rental rates—Frequencies.
The department shall determine the lease rate for amateur radio electronic repeater sites and units available for public service communication. For the amateur operator to qualify for a rent of one hundred dollars per year per site, the amateur operator shall do one of the following: (1) Register and remain in good standing with the state's radio amateur civil emergency services and amateur radio emergency services organizations, or (2) if an amateur group, sign a statement of public service developed by the department.

The legislature's biennial appropriations shall account for the estimated difference between the one hundred dollar per year, per site, per lessee paid by the qualified amateur operators and the fair market amateur rent, as established by the department.

The amateur radio regulatory authority approved by the federal communication commission shall assign the radio frequencies used by amateur radio lessees. The department shall develop guidelines to determine which lessees are to receive reduced rental fees as moneys are available by legislative appropriation to pay a portion of the rent for electronic repeaters operated by amateur radio operators.

## 79.13.520 - Nonprofit television reception improvements districts—Rental of public lands—Intent.
The department shall determine the fair market rental rate for leases to nonprofit television reception improvement districts. It is the intent of the legislature to appropriate general funds to pay a portion of the rent charged to nonprofit television reception improvement districts. It is the further intent of the legislature that such a lessee pay an annual lease rent of fifty percent of the fair market rental rate, as long as there is a general fund appropriation to compensate the trusts for the remainder of the fair market rental rate.

\[ [2003 c 334 § 464](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1252.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20334%20§%20464); [1994 c 294 § 1](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6556-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%20294%20§%201); \]

## 79.13.530 - Geothermal resources—Guidelines for development.
In an effort to increase potential revenue to the geothermal account, the department shall, by December 1, 1991, adopt rules providing guidelines and procedures for leasing state-owned land for the development of geothermal resources.

\[ [2003 c 334 § 465](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1252.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20334%20§%20465); [1991 c 76 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1277.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%2076%20§%203); \]

## 79.13.600 - Findings—Salmon stocks—Grazing lands—Coordinated resource management plans.
The legislature finds that many wild stocks of salmonids in the state of Washington are in a state of decline. Stocks of salmon on the Columbia and Snake rivers have been listed under the federal endangered species act, and the bull trout has been petitioned for listing. Some scientists believe that numerous other stocks of salmonids in the Pacific Northwest are in decline or possibly extinct. The legislature declares that to lose wild stocks is detrimental to the genetic diversity of the fisheries resource and the economy, and will represent the loss of a vital component of Washington's aquatic ecosystems. The legislature further finds that there is a continuing loss of habitat for fish and wildlife. The legislature declares that steps must be taken in the areas of wildlife and fish habitat management, water conservation, wild salmonid stock protection, and education to prevent further losses of Washington's fish and wildlife heritage from a number of causes including urban and rural subdivisions, shopping centers, industrial park, and other land use activities.

The legislature finds that the maintenance and restoration of Washington's rangelands and shrub-steppe vegetation is vital to the long-term benefit of the people of the state. The legislature finds that approximately one-fourth of the state is open range or open-canopied grazable woodland. The legislature finds that these lands provide forage for livestock, habitat for wildlife, and innumerable recreational opportunities including hunting, hiking, and fishing.

The legislature finds that the development of coordinated resource management plans, that take into consideration the needs of wildlife, fish, livestock, timber production, water quality protection, and rangeland conservation on all state-owned grazing lands will improve the stewardship of these lands and allow for the increased development and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat and other multipurpose benefits the public derives from these lands.

The legislature finds that the state currently provides insufficient technical support for coordinated resource management plans to be developed for all state-owned lands and for many of the private lands desiring to develop such plans. As a consequence of this lack of technical assistance, our state grazing lands, including fish and wildlife habitat and other resources provided by these lands, are not achieving their potential. The legislature also finds that with many state lands being intermixed with private grazing lands, development of coordinated resource management plans on state-owned and managed lands provides an opportunity to improve the management and enhance the conditions of adjacent private lands.

A purpose of chapter 4, Laws of 1993 sp. sess. is to establish state grazing lands as the model in the state for the development and implementation of standards that can be used in coordinated resource management plans and to thereby assist the timely development of coordinated resource management plans for all state-owned grazing lands. Every lessee of state lands who wishes to participate in the development and implementation of a coordinated resource management plan shall have the opportunity to do so.

## 79.13.610 - Grazing lands—Fish and wildlife goals—Technical advisory committee—Implementation.
1. By December 31, 1993, the department of fish and wildlife shall develop goals for the wildlife and fish that this agency manages, to preserve, protect, and perpetuate wildlife and fish on shrub steppe habitat or on lands that are presently agricultural lands, rangelands, or grazable woodlands. These goals shall be consistent with the maintenance of a healthy ecosystem.

2. By July 31, 1993, the conservation commission shall appoint a technical advisory committee to develop standards that achieve the goals developed in subsection (1) of this section. The committee members shall include but not be limited to technical experts representing the following interests: Agriculture, academia, range management, utilities, environmental groups, commercial and recreational fishing interests, the Washington rangelands committee, Indian tribes, the department of fish and wildlife, the department of natural resources, the department of ecology, conservation districts, and the department of agriculture. A member of the conservation commission shall chair the committee.

3. By December 31, 1994, the committee shall develop standards to meet the goals developed under subsection (1) of this section. These standards shall not conflict with the recovery of wildlife or fish species that are listed or proposed for listing under the federal endangered species act. These standards shall be utilized to the extent possible in development of coordinated resource management plans to provide a level of management that sustains and perpetuates renewable resources, including fish and wildlife, riparian areas, soil, water, timber, and forage for livestock and wildlife. Furthermore, the standards are recommended for application to model watersheds designated by the Northwest power planning council in conjunction with the conservation commission. The maintenance and restoration of sufficient habitat to preserve, protect, and perpetuate wildlife and fish shall be a major component included in the standards and coordinated resource management plans. Application of standards to privately owned lands is voluntary and may be dependent on funds to provide technical assistance through conservation districts.

4. The conservation commission shall approve the standards and shall provide them to the departments of natural resources and fish and wildlife, each of the conservation districts, and Washington State University cooperative extension service. The conservation districts shall make these standards available to the public and for coordinated resource management planning. Application to private lands is voluntary.

5. The department of natural resources shall implement practices necessary to meet the standards developed pursuant to this section on department managed agricultural and grazing lands, consistent with the trust mandate of the Washington state Constitution and Title 79 RCW. The standards may be modified on a site-specific basis as needed to achieve the fish and wildlife goals, and as determined by the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of natural resources. Existing lessees shall be provided an opportunity to participate in any site-specific field review. Department agricultural and grazing leases issued after December 31, 1994, shall be subject to practices to achieve the standards that meet those developed pursuant to this section.

## 79.13.620 - Purpose—Ecosystem standards.
1. It is the purpose of chapter 163, Laws of 1996 that all state agricultural lands, grazing lands, and grazeable woodlands shall be managed in keeping with the statutory and constitutional mandates under which each agency operates. Chapter 163, Laws of 1996 is consistent with section 1, chapter 4, Laws of 1993 sp. sess.

2. The ecosystem standards developed under chapter 4, Laws of 1993 sp. sess. for state-owned agricultural and grazing lands are defined as desired ecological conditions. The standards are not intended to prescribe practices. For this reason, land managers are encouraged to use an adaptive management approach in selecting and implementing practices that work towards meeting the standards based on the best available science and evaluation tools.

3. For as long as the chapter 4, Laws of 1993 sp. sess. ecosystem standards remain in effect, they shall be applied through a collaborative process that incorporates the following principles:

   a. The land manager and lessee or permittee shall look at the land together and make every effort to reach agreement on management and resource objectives for the land under consideration;

   b. They will then discuss management options and make every effort to reach agreement on which of the available options will be used to achieve the agreed-upon objectives;

   c. No land manager or owner ever gives up his or her management prerogative;

   d. Efforts will be made to make land management plans economically feasible for landowners, managers, and lessees and to make the land management plan compatible with the lessee's entire operation;

   e. Coordinated resource management planning is encouraged where either multiple ownerships, or management practices, or both, are involved;

   f. The department of fish and wildlife shall consider multiple use, including grazing, on lands owned or managed by the department of fish and wildlife where it is compatible with the management objectives of the land; and

   g. The department shall allow multiple use on lands owned or managed by the department where multiple use can be demonstrated to be compatible with RCW 79.10.100, 79.10.110, and 79.10.120.

4. The ecosystem standards are to be achieved by applying appropriate land management practices on riparian lands and on the uplands in order to reach the desired ecological conditions.

5. The legislature urges that state agencies that manage grazing lands make planning and implementation of chapter 163, Laws of 1996, using the coordinated resource management and planning process, a high priority, especially where either multiple ownerships, or multiple use resources objectives, or both, are involved. In all cases, the choice of using the coordinated resource management planning process will be a voluntary decision by all concerned parties including agencies, private landowners, lessees, permittees, and other interests.
