The board may reestablish the minimum appraisal value at any time. For any valuable materials sales that the board is required by law to appraise, the board may by resolution transfer this authority to the department.

2. Where the board has set a minimum appraisal value for a valuable materials sale, the department may set the final appraisal value of valuable materials for auction, which must be based on current market prices. The department may also appraise any valuable materials sale not required by law to be approved by the board.

## 79.15.090 - Advertisement for informational purposes only.
The advertisement of sales is for informational purposes only, and under no circumstances does the information in the notice of sale constitute a warranty that the purchaser will receive the stated values, volumes, or acreage.

   a. "Lump sum sale" means any sale offered with a single total price applying to all the material conveyed.

   b. "Scale sale" means any sale offered with per unit prices to be applied to the material conveyed.

2. Payment for lump sum sales must be made as follows:

   a. Lump sum sales under five thousand dollars appraised value require full payment on the day of sale.

6. The department may extend a contract beyond the normal termination date specified in the sale contract as the time for removal of valuable materials when, in the department's judgment, the purchaser is acting in good faith and endeavoring to remove the materials. The extension is contingent upon payment of the fees specified below.

   a. The extended time for removal shall not exceed:

      i. Forty years from date of purchase for stone, sand, gravel, fill material, or building stone;

      ii. A total of ten years beyond the original termination date for all other valuable materials.

The board must periodically fix and adopt by rule the interest rate, which shall not be less than six percent per annum.

   c. The sale contract shall specify:

1. "Commissioner" means the commissioner of public lands.

2. "Contract harvesting" means a timber operation occurring on state forestlands, in which the department contracts with a firm or individual to perform all the necessary harvesting work to process trees into logs sorted by department specifications. The department then sells the individual log sorts.

3. "Department" means the department of natural resources.

4. "Harvesting costs" are those expenses related to the production of log sorts from a stand of timber. These expenses typically involve road building, labor for felling, bucking, and yarding, as well as the transporting of sorted logs to the forest product purchasers.

5. "Net proceeds" means gross proceeds from a contract harvesting sale less harvesting costs.

6. "Silvicultural treatment" means any vegetative or other treatment applied to a managed forest to improve the conditions of the stand, and may include harvesting, thinning, prescribed burning, and pruning.

\[ [2004 c 218 § 8](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6144-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20218%20§%208); [2003 c 313 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5074-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20313%20§%202); \]

## 79.15.510 - Contract harvesting—Program established.
1. The department may establish a contract harvesting program for directly contracting for the removal of timber and other valuable materials from state lands and for conducting silvicultural treatments consistent with RCW 79.15.540.

2. The contract requirements must be compatible with the office of financial management's guide to public service contracts.

3. The department may not use contract harvesting for more than twenty percent of the total annual volume of timber offered for sale. However, volume removed primarily to address an identified forest health issue under RCW 79.15.540 may not be included in calculating the annual limit of contract harvesting sales. Forest biomass resulting from harvesting to address an identified forest health issue under RCW 79.15.540 may be utilized in accordance with chapter 79.150 RCW.

\[ [2010 c 126 § 11](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2481-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20126%20§%2011); 2010 c 126 § 12; 2017 c 64 § 2; [2009 c 418 § 2](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6166.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20418%20§%202); [2004 c 218 § 6](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6144-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20218%20§%206); [2003 c 313 § 3](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5074-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20313%20§%203); \]

## 79.15.520 - Contract harvesting revolving account.
1. The contract harvesting revolving account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from the gross proceeds of the sale of logs from a contract harvesting sale must be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the payment of harvesting costs incurred on contract harvesting sales and for payment of costs incurred from silvicultural treatments necessary to improve forest health conducted under RCW 79.15.540. Only the commissioner or the commissioner's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The board of natural resources has oversight of the account, and the commissioner must periodically report to the board of natural resources as to the status of the account, its disbursement, and receipts. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

2. When the logs from a contract harvesting sale are sold, the gross proceeds must be deposited into the contract harvesting revolving account. Moneys equal to the harvesting costs must be retained in the account and be deducted from the gross proceeds to determine the net proceeds. The net proceeds from the sale of the logs must be distributed in accordance with RCW 43.30.325(1)(b). The final receipt of gross proceeds on a contract harvesting sale must be retained in the contract harvesting revolving account until all required costs for that sale have been paid. The contract harvesting revolving account is an interest-bearing account and the interest must be credited to the account. The account balance may not exceed five million dollars at the end of each calendar year. Moneys in excess of five million dollars must be disbursed according to RCW 79.22.040, 79.22.050, and 79.64.040. If the department permanently discontinues the use of contract harvesting sales, any sums remaining in the contract harvesting revolving account must be returned to the resource management cost account and the forest development account in proportion to each account's contribution to the initial balance of the contract harvesting revolving account.

## 79.15.530 - Contract harvesting—Special appraisal practices.
The board of natural resources must determine whether any special appraisal practices are necessary for logs sold by the contract harvesting processes, and if so, must adopt the special appraisal practices or procedures. In its consideration of special appraisal practices, the board of natural resources must consider and adopt procedures to rapidly market and sell any log sorts that failed to receive the required minimum bid at the original auction, which may include allowing the department to set a new appraised value for the unsold sort.

The board of natural resources must establish and adopt policy and procedures by which the department evaluates and selects certified contract harvesters. The procedures must include a method whereby a certified contract harvester may appeal a decision by the department or board of natural resources to not include the certified contract harvester on the list of approved contract harvesters.

\[ [2003 c 313 § 5](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5074-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2003%20c%20313%20§%205); \]

## 79.15.540 - Intent—Contract harvesting—State trust forestland with identified forest health deficiencies.
1. The legislature intends to ensure, to the extent feasible given all applicable trust responsibilities, that trust beneficiaries receive long-term income from timberlands through improved forest conditions and by reducing the threat of forest fire to state trust forestlands.

2. In order to implement the intent of RCW 76.06.140, the department may initiate contract harvesting timber sales, or other silvicultural treatments when appropriate, in specific areas of state trust forestland where the department has identified forest health deficiencies as enumerated in RCW 76.06.140. All harvesting or silvicultural treatments applied under this section must be tailored to improve the health of the specific stand, must be consistent with any applicable state forest plans and other management agreements, and must comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations regarding the harvest of timber by the department of natural resources.

3. In utilizing contract harvesting to address forest health issues as outlined in this section, the department shall give priority to silvicultural treatments that assist the department in meeting forest health strategies included in any management or landscape plans that exist for state forests. If such plans are not in place, the department shall prioritize silvicultural treatments for forest health with higher priority given to the protection of public health and safety, public resources as defined in RCW 76.09.020, and the long-term asset value of the trust.
