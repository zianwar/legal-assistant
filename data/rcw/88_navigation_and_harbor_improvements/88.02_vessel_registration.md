## 88.02.650 - Deposit of fees in general fund—Allocation for boating safety and education and law enforcement purposes.
1. General fees for vessel registrations collected by the director must be deposited in the general fund. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, any amount above one million one hundred thousand dollars per fiscal year must be allocated to counties by the state treasurer for boating safety/education and law enforcement programs. Eligibility for boating safety/education and law enforcement program allocations is contingent upon approval of the local boating safety program by the state parks and recreation commission. Fund allocation must be based on the numbers of registered vessels by county of moorage. Each benefiting county is responsible for equitable distribution of such allocation to other jurisdictions with approved boating safety programs within the county. Any fees not allocated to counties due to the absence of an approved boating safety program must be allocated to the state parks and recreation commission for awards to local governments to offset law enforcement and boating safety impacts of boaters recreating in jurisdictions other than where registered. Jurisdictions receiving funds under this section shall deposit the funds into an account dedicated solely for supporting the jurisdiction's boating safety programs. These funds may not replace existing local funds used for boating safety programs.

2. During the 2015-2017 fiscal biennium, if 2015 *Engrossed Senate Bill No. 5416 is enacted before August 1, 2015, any amount above one million three hundred fifty thousand dollars per fiscal year must be allocated to counties by the state treasurer for boating safety, education, and law enforcement programs.
