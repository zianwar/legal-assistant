## 88.46.125 - Emergency response system—Funding—Intent—Finding.
1. It is the intent of the legislature to provide the various components of the maritime industry with the tools necessary to satisfy the requirements of RCW 88.46.130 in the most cost-effective manner. In doing, the legislature encourages, but does not mandate, the maritime industry to unite behind their mutual interests and responsibilities and identify or form a single umbrella organization that allows all affected covered vessels to equitably share the costs inherent in the implementation of RCW 88.46.130.

2. The legislature further finds that, given the broad range of covered vessel types and sizes, an equitable sharing of the costs of implementing RCW 88.46.130 will likely mean that not all covered vessels will be responsible for providing the same amount of funding. Any umbrella organization that is identified or formed to satisfy the requirements of chapter 11, Laws of 2009 should consider the multitude of factors that comprise the risk of vessel emergencies and the likelihood of initiating a response from the emergency response vessel required by RCW 88.46.130.

3. The legislature intends to provide the authority for any operator of a covered vessel that feels as though an umbrella organization that is identified, formed, or proposed for formation does not equitably share the costs of compliance with RCW 88.46.130 with the covered vessel in question, or the class of vessel to which the covered vessel belongs, to either contract directly with an adequate emergency response vessel or form or join a discreet umbrella organization representing the appropriate segment of the maritime industry. However, if the operator of a covered vessel chooses not to join a proposed or existing umbrella organization, or finds that negotiations leading to the formation of an umbrella organization are not progressing in an adequate manner, the legislature requests, but does not require, that the vessel operator contact the department and provide official notice of their concern as to how the umbrella group in question failed in establishing an equitable cost-share strategy.

4. The department shall collect and maintain all notices received under this section and shall summarize any reports received by the operators of covered vessels and report the summation to the appropriate committees of the legislature upon request by a legislative committee.

## 88.46.130 - Emergency response system.
1. By July 1, 2010, the owner or operator of a covered vessel transiting to or from a Washington port through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, except for transits extending no further west than Race Rocks light, shall establish and fund an emergency response system that provides for an emergency response towing vessel to be stationed at Neah Bay. 

2. Any emergency response towing vessel provided under this section must:

   a. Be available to serve vessels in distress in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and off of the western coast of the state from Cape Flattery light in Clallam county south to Cape Disappointment light in Pacific county; and

   b. Meet the requirements specified in RCW 88.46.135.

3. In addition to meeting requirements specified in RCW 88.46.060, contingency plans for covered vessels operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca must provide for the emergency response system required by this section. Documents describing how compliance with this section will be achieved must be submitted to the department by December 1, 2009. An initial contingency plan submitted to the department after December 1, 2009, must be accompanied by documents demonstrating compliance with this section.

4. The requirements of this section are met if:

   a. Owners or operators of covered vessels provide an emergency response towing vessel that complies with subsection (2) of this section; or

   b. The United States government implements a system of protective measures that the department determines to be substantially equivalent to the requirements of this section as long as the emergency response towing vessel required by this section is stationed at Neah Bay.

      ii. Vessel dewatering;

      iii. Air safety monitoring; and

      iv. Digital photography.

2. The requirements of this section may be fulfilled by one or more private organizations or nonprofit cooperatives providing umbrella coverage under contract to single or multiple covered vessels.

3. [Empty]

   a. The department must be authorized to contract with the emergency response towing vessel, at the discretion of the department, in response to a potentially emerging maritime casualty or as a precautionary measure during severe storms. All instances of use by the department must be paid for by the department.

   b. Covered vessels that are required to provide an emergency response towing vessel under RCW 88.46.130 may not restrict the emergency response towing vessel from responding to distressed vessels that are not covered vessels.

4. Nothing in this section limits the ability of a covered vessel to contract with an emergency response towing vessel with capabilities that exceed the minimum capabilities provided for a towing vessel in this section.

5. The covered vessel owner or operator shall submit a written report to the department as soon as practicable regarding an emergency response system deployment, including photographic documentation determined by the department to be of adequate quality. The report must provide a detailed description of the incident necessitating a response and the actions taken to render assistance under the emergency response system.

## 88.46.139 - Emergency response system—Adequacy determination—Practice drills.
1. As part of reviewing contingency plans submitted under RCW 88.46.130, the department may determine the adequacy of the emergency response system required in RCW 88.46.130 through practice drills that test compliance with the requirements of RCW 88.46.135. Practice drills may be conducted without prior notice.
