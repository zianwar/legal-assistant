## 88.04.035 - Inspection of charter boats—Certificate of inspection.
The department shall inspect or provide for the inspection of every charter boat once every twelve months with the vessel in the water to determine if the vessel and its equipment comply with the rules promulgated by the department and with the applicable state and federal laws and regulations.

In addition, the department may at any time inspect or provide for the inspection of any charter boat if the department has reasonable cause to believe either that a provision of this chapter has been violated or that an inspection is necessary to ensure the safety of persons or property on the vessel.

1. Ninety days before any certificate of inspection expires, the department shall mail written notification to the owner of the vessel that a twelve-month or sixty-month inspection must be completed before the expiration date. The department shall include with the notification an application for inspection, which must be completed and returned by the owner no later than sixty days before the expiration date of the current certificate of inspection. The owner shall include the registration fee with the completed application form. A person filing an application shall certify by the person's signature that the information furnished on the application is true and correct.

Such certificate shall specify the maximum passenger, crew, and total person capacity of the charter boat. The certificate shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. The certificate shall be prominently displayed on the charter boat while the charter boat is operating upon state waters.

A person filing an application shall certify by the person's signature that the information furnished on the application is true and correct.

A charter boat that operates on state waters under a reciprocal agreement pursuant to this section shall obtain an annual operating permit from the department for a fee for each year the charter boat does business on the waters of the state of Washington.
