\[ [2019 c 37 § 102](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5002.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%2037%20§%20102); \]

## 23.100.0103 - Nature of limited cooperative association.
1. A limited cooperative association organized under this chapter is an autonomous, unincorporated association of persons united to meet their mutual interests through a jointly owned enterprise primarily controlled by those persons, which permits combining:

   a. Ownership, financing, and receipt of benefits by the members for whose interests the association is formed; and

   b. Separate investments in the association by members who may receive returns on their investments and a share of control.

2. The fact that a limited cooperative association does not have one or more of the characteristics described in subsection (1) of this section does not alone prevent the association from being formed under and governed by this chapter nor does it alone provide a basis for an action against the association.

\[ [2019 c 37 § 103](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5002.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%2037%20§%20103); \]

## 23.100.0104 - Purpose and duration of limited cooperative association.
1. A limited cooperative association is an entity distinct from its members.

2. A limited cooperative association may be organized for any lawful purpose, regardless of whether for profit, except that a limited cooperative association may not be organized for the purpose of generating, purchasing, selling, marketing, transmitting, or distributing electric energy.

3. Unless the articles of organization state a term for a limited cooperative association's existence, the association has perpetual duration.

\[ [2019 c 37 § 104](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5002.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%2037%20§%20104); \]

## 23.100.0105 - Powers.
Unless its articles of organization provide otherwise, a limited cooperative association has the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name and has the power to do all things necessary or convenient to carry on its activities and affairs. An association may maintain an action against a member for harm caused to the association by the member's violation of a duty to the association or of the organic law or organic rules.

\[ [2019 c 37 § 105](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5002.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%2037%20§%20105); \]

## 23.100.0106 - Governing law.
The law of this state governs:

1. The internal affairs of a limited cooperative association; and

2. The liability of a member as a member and a director as a director for the debts, obligations, or other liabilities of a limited cooperative association.

\[ [2019 c 37 § 106](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5002.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%2037%20§%20106); \]

## 23.100.0107 - Requirements of other laws.
1. This chapter does not alter or amend any law that governs the licensing and regulation of an individual or entity in carrying on a specific business or profession even if that law permits the business or profession to be conducted by a limited cooperative association, a foreign cooperative, or members of either.

2. A limited cooperative association may not conduct an activity that, under law of this state other than this chapter, may be conducted only by an entity that meets specific requirements for the internal affairs of that entity unless the organic rules of the association conform to those requirements.

\[ [2019 c 37 § 107](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5002.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%2037%20§%20107); \]

## 23.100.0108 - Relation to restraint of trade and antitrust laws.
To the extent a limited cooperative association or activities conducted by the association in this state meet the material requirements for other cooperatives entitled to an exemption from or immunity under any provision of RCW 19.86.030 through 19.86.050, the association and its activities are entitled to the exemption or immunity. This section does not create any new exemption or immunity for an association or affect any exemption or immunity provided to a cooperative organized under any law other than this chapter.

\[ [2019 c 37 § 108](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5002.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%2037%20§%20108); \]

## 23.100.0109 - Effect of organic rules.
1. The relations between a limited cooperative association and its members are consensual. Unless required, limited, or prohibited by this chapter, the organic rules may provide for any matter concerning the relations among the members of the association and between the members and the association, the activities of the association, and the conduct of its activities.

2. The matters referred to in (a) through (k) of this subsection may be varied only in the articles of organization. The articles may:

   a. State a term of existence for the association under RCW 23.100.0104(3);

   b. Limit or eliminate the acceptance of new or additional members by the initial board of directors under RCW 23.100.0202(2);

2. A limited cooperative association may not make a distribution, including a distribution under RCW 23.100.1008, if after the distribution:

   a. The association would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the association's activities and affairs; or

   b.

3. A limited cooperative association may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (2) of this section on:

   a. Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable under the circumstances; or

   b. A fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.

4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, the effect of a distribution allowed under subsection (2) of this section is measured:

      i. The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs not later than one hundred twenty days after that date; or

      ii. The payment is made, if the payment occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the distribution is authorized.

6. A limited cooperative association's indebtedness, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not a liability for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if the terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest is made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made.

7. In measuring the effect of a distribution under RCW 23.100.1008, the liabilities of a dissolved limited cooperative association do not include any claim that has been disposed of under RCW 23.100.1009 through 23.100.1011.
