The court is authorized to levy on and recover from each violator a civil fine not to exceed the greater of: (1) Two dollars for each copy of the deceptive material distributed, or (2) one thousand dollars. In addition, the violator is liable for the state's legal expenses and other costs resulting from the violation. Any funds recovered under this section must be transmitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the general fund.

## 29A.32.080 - Amendatory style.
Statewide ballot measures that amend existing law must be printed in the voters' pamphlet so that language proposed for deletion is enclosed by double parentheses and has a line through it. Proposed new language must be underlined. A statement explaining the deletion and addition of language must appear as follows: "Any language in double parentheses with a line through it is existing state law and will be taken out of the law if this measure is approved by voters. Any underlined language does not appear in current state law but will be added to the law if this measure is approved by voters."

## 29A.32.090 - Arguments—Rejection, dispute.
1. If in the opinion of the secretary of state any argument or statement offered for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet in support of or opposition to a measure or candidate contains obscene matter or matter that is otherwise prohibited by law from distribution through the mail, the secretary may petition the superior court of Thurston county for a judicial determination that the argument or statement may be rejected for publication or edited to delete the matter. The court shall not enter such an order unless it concludes that the matter is obscene or otherwise prohibited for distribution through the mail.

2. A candidate's statement submitted for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet shall not contain false or misleading statements about the candidate's opponent. A false or misleading statement shall be considered "libel or defamation per se" if the statement tends to expose the candidate to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or to deprive him or her of the benefit of public confidence or social intercourse, or to injure him or her in his or her business or occupation. If a candidate believes his or her opponent has libeled or defamed him or her, the candidate may commence an action under subsection (3) of this section.

3. [Empty]

   a. A person who believes that he or she may be defamed by an argument or statement offered for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet in support of or opposition to a measure or candidate may petition the superior court of Thurston county for a judicial determination that the argument or statement may be rejected for publication or edited to delete the defamatory statement.

   b. The court shall not enter such an order unless it concludes that the statement is untrue and that the petitioner has a very substantial likelihood of prevailing in a defamation action.

   c. An action under this subsection (3) must be filed and served no later than the tenth day after the deadline for the submission of the argument or statement to the secretary of state.

   d. If the secretary of state notifies a person named or identified in an argument or statement of the contents of the argument or statement within three days after the deadline for submission to the secretary, then neither the state nor the secretary is liable for damages resulting from publication of the argument or statement unless the secretary publishes the argument or statement in violation of an order entered under this section. Nothing in this section creates a duty on the part of the secretary of state to identify, locate, or notify the person.

4. Parties to a dispute under this section may agree to resolve the dispute by rephrasing the argument or statement, even if the deadline for submission to the secretary has elapsed, unless the secretary determines that the process of publication is too far advanced to permit the change. The secretary shall promptly provide any such revision to any committee entitled to submit a rebuttal argument. If that committee has not yet submitted its rebuttal, its deadline to submit a rebuttal is extended by five days. If it has submitted a rebuttal, it may revise it to address the change within five days of the filing of the revised argument with the secretary.

5. In an action under this section the committee or candidate must be named as a defendant, and may be served with process by certified mail directed to the address contained in the secretary's records for that party. The secretary of state shall be a nominal party to an action brought under subsection (3) of this section, solely for the purpose of determining the content of the voters' pamphlet. The superior court shall give such an action priority on its calendar.

## 29A.32.100 - Arguments—Public inspection.
1. An argument or statement submitted to the secretary of state for publication in the voters' pamphlet is not available for public inspection or copying until:

   a. In the case of candidate statements, (i) all statements by all candidates who have filed for a particular office have been received, except those who informed the secretary that they will not submit statements, or (ii) the deadline for submission of statements has elapsed;

   b. In the case of arguments supporting or opposing a measure, (i) the arguments on both sides have been received, unless a committee was not appointed for one side, or (ii) the deadline for submission of arguments has elapsed; and

   c. In the case of rebuttal arguments, (i) the rebuttals on both sides have been received, unless a committee was not appointed for one side, or (ii) the deadline for submission of arguments has elapsed.

2. Nothing in this section prohibits the secretary from releasing information under RCW 29A.32.090.

## 29A.32.210 - Duty to print and distribute—Contents—Format.
Before any primary or general election, or any special election held under RCW 29A.04.321 or 29A.04.330, each county auditor shall print and distribute a local voters' pamphlet.

The format of any local voters' pamphlet shall, whenever applicable, comply with the provisions of this chapter regarding the publication of the state candidates' and voters' pamphlets.

## 29A.32.220 - Notice of production—Local governments' decision to participate.
1. Not later than ninety days before the publication and distribution of a local voters' pamphlet by a county, the county auditor shall notify each city, town, or special taxing district located wholly within that county that a pamphlet will be produced. 

2. If a voters' pamphlet is published by the county for a primary or general election, the pamphlet shall be published for the elective offices and ballot measures of the county and for the elective offices and ballot measures of each unit of local government located entirely within the county which will appear on the ballot at that primary or election. However, the offices and measures of a first-class or code city shall not be included in the pamphlet if the city publishes and distributes its own voters' pamphlet for the primary or election for its offices and measures. The offices and measures of any other town or city are not required to appear in the county's pamphlet if the town or city is obligated by ordinance or charter to publish and distribute a voters' pamphlet for the primary or election for its offices and measures and it does so.

If the required appearance in a county's voters' pamphlet of the offices or measures of a unit of local government would create undue financial hardship for the unit of government, the legislative authority of the unit may petition the legislative authority of the county to waive this requirement. The legislative authority of the county may provide such a waiver if it does so not later than sixty days before the publication of the pamphlet and it finds that the requirement would create such hardship.

3. If a city, town, or district is located within more than one county, the respective county auditors may enter into an interlocal agreement to permit the distribution of each county's local voters' pamphlet into those parts of the city, town, or district located outside of that county.

4.
